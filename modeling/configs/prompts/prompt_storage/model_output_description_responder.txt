Design a computational model for the given task. The model should obtain the utility, (not the probability of choosing an action).  Your goal is to eventually explore the entire space of possible explainations and mechanisms by which the observed behavior arises.

Your model should use the given variables appropriately, but does not necessary need to use all or even most of the variables. Do not include the model for the utility of rejecting an offer. 

The model should:
1. Predict only responder behavior.
2. Build on relevant psychological principles.
3. Be considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters as the model will have to pass parameter recovery tests.
4. Be applicable to the dataset given within the task description (i.e. the model should be able to be run using only the provided dataset structure).
5. Not include parameters to simulate general stochasticity of behavior, because this will be handled later by a temperature parameter.
6. Should have no more than two learnable parameters.
7. This specific model should calculate the utility of an action, which will then be used to determine the probability of choosing that action. Negative values should represent a negative utility, and thus an unlikely action.

For any learnable parameters in your model, you must specify finite numerical bounds (it just can not be infinity) in the variable descriptions. However, this bound should be generous. The utility variable may be unbounded (-inf to inf).

First, reason step by step about:
* The key psychological mechanisms involved
* How these mechanisms interact
* What mathematical form could capture these interactions
* What parameters would be needed to calibrate the model
* How the model variables map to observable behavior

Then, provide your formal mathematical model between <MODEL> tags, followed by variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> tags. Use clear mathematical notation and ensure each variable is fully described. Every variable must be utilized within the mathematical formula provided between <MODEL> and </MODEL>. For variable descriptions, provide them in a JSON format with the following structure: <VARIABLES> Bounds are by default inclusive. Please spell out the greek variable names instead of using the symbols. Finally, you should provide a short description of the model in the summary tags <SUMMARY> </SUMMARY>. This will be used to compare different computational models of the task; it should be concise and purely descriptive. Do not include generic information about the name of the tasks, since that is implied.

<SUMMARY>
A linear utility model combining base preference, environmental influence, and stochastic noise. The model uses two learnable parameters: a base tendency parameter (β) constrained to [0,1] and an unconstrained environmental sensitivity parameter (ε). Environmental cues and normally distributed noise modify the base utility, allowing for both systematic and random variation in choice behavior.

</EXAMPLE>

Please be sure to provide the mathematical formula for the model between <MODEL> and </MODEL>, and the variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES>. No description of the model should be provided within the <MODEL> tags.

The parameter names you choose in your <VARIABLES> section will be used exactly as specified in subsequent code generation. Please choose clear, non-reserved parameter names that can be used directly in Python code. For example, avoid Python reserved words like 'lambda' and use alternatives like 'learning_rate' or 'lambda_param'. DO NOT USE 'lambda' AS A PARAMETER NAME.
