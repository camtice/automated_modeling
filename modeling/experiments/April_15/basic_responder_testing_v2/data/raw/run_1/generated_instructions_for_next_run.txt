The previous model had decent accuracy, but poor parameter recovery and a BIC that could be improved. The low parameter recovery suggests high covariance between the parameters or an insufficiently complex model. Let's focus on improving parameter recovery, which should also help with BIC. The recovery for gamma_self was high, whereas the others were not great.

Here's what I'll do:

1.  **Emphasize Prior Knowledge:** Remind the model to incorporate any prior knowledge or constraints that could reduce parameter covariance. For example, we could have a better prior belief about fairness_sensitivity (alpha), or amount_sensitivity (beta)
2.  **Consider interaction terms:** Consider multiplicative interactions between the contribution weights and the fairness sensitivity.
3.  **Encourage Alternative Functional Forms:** Suggest exploring different functional forms for fairness and loss aversion, rather than sticking to the standard linear or power law forms. Perhaps some kind of diminishing return should be considered.
4.  **Suggest a Model Comparison Heuristic**: Given the previous model had a middling BIC, make sure that the model proposes a significantly different BIC.

Be VERY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters in the model. Aim for an appropriate number of learnable parameters, with a slight bias toward fewer if it improves parameter identifiability. The model should propose a significantly different BIC than previous models.

When developing your model, reason step by step about:

*   The key psychological mechanisms involved
*   How these mechanisms interact, including potential multiplicative or non-linear interactions
*   What mathematical form could capture these interactions, exploring options beyond standard linear or power law functions (consider diminishing returns or other non-linear relationships)
*   What parameters would be needed to calibrate the model, carefully considering potential parameter covariance and identifiability issues
*   How the model variables map to observable behavior
*   Incorporate any prior knowledge or constraints that could reduce parameter covariance and improve parameter identifiability. What are reasonable estimates of each learnable parameter?
