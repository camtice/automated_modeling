The previous model had good recovery for beta and lambda, but very poor recovery for alpha, and the overall accuracy was middling, though the BIC score was good. We need to dramatically improve the recovery of alpha and consider if there is an interaction between alpha and the other parameters. This might involve rethinking the model's core assumptions about fairness. Also, it may be advantageous to try a different loss aversion functional form.

Here's what I'll do:

1. **Re-evaluate the fairness component:** The model seems to struggle with capturing fairness sensitivity. Encourage exploring alternative ways to model how people perceive fairness, beyond the simple proportional split based on token counts. Consider how trial_type (equal, opponent more, participant more) could directly inform fairness perception.
2. **Explore non-linear loss aversion:** The current linear loss aversion might be too simplistic. Suggest a non-linear form, perhaps with diminishing sensitivity to losses as they become larger. For example, a log transform of the difference between the fair share and the actual split.
3. **Interaction terms revisited:** While the previous attempt had an interaction term, it might not have been the right one. Prompt the model to consider interaction terms between alpha and beta. Is fairness more important when the stakes are high (high combined_earning)?
4. **Prior Knowledge, again:** Re-emphasize the importance of incorporating prior knowledge, especially regarding fairness. What is a reasonable range for alpha, given the experimental context? Are participants likely to be completely insensitive to fairness (alpha close to 0), or are they likely to heavily weigh it (alpha significantly greater than 0)?
5.  **Suggest an additional psychological mechanism**: Suggest that they add a "status quo bias", where they are biased to reject offers where they have contributed more.
6. **Model Comparison Heuristic**: Strongly encourage that the model proposes a significantly different BIC.

Be VERY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters in the model. Aim for an appropriate number of learnable parameters, with a slight bias toward fewer if it improves parameter identifiability. The model should propose a significantly different BIC than previous models.

When developing your model, reason step by step about:

*   The key psychological mechanisms involved, including fairness, loss aversion, and amount sensitivity.
*   How these mechanisms interact, including potential multiplicative or non-linear interactions. Specifically, consider interactions between fairness sensitivity (alpha) and amount sensitivity (beta), as well as the role of combined_earning in modulating fairness perception.
*   What mathematical form could capture these interactions, exploring options beyond standard linear or power law functions. Explore non-linear loss aversion functions (e.g., logarithmic) and alternative ways to model fairness perception, perhaps by incorporating trial_type.
*   What parameters would be needed to calibrate the model, carefully considering potential parameter covariance and identifiability issues. What are reasonable estimates of each learnable parameter? What is a reasonable prior range for fairness sensitivity (alpha), and amount sensitivity (beta)?
*   How the model variables map to observable behavior.
*   Incorporate any prior knowledge or constraints that could reduce parameter covariance and improve parameter identifiability. What are reasonable estimates of each learnable parameter? Consider adding a status quo bias where participants are more likely to reject offers when they contribute more.
