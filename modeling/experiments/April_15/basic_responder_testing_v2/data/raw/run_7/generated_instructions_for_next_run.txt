The previous model performed poorly, with very low parameter recovery, poor accuracy, and a high BIC. It's clear the model is over-parameterized, and the chosen functional forms don't capture the underlying psychology well, or are too heavily parameterized without a strong reason. The interaction between alpha and combined_earning didn't help, and the trial_type multiplier also failed to improve parameter recovery. The individual power laws for different parameters were also not identifiable.

Here's what to do to improve, focusing on simplification and identifiability:

1.  **Drastically Reduce Parameters:** Aim for a model with *at most* 4 learnable parameters, and preferably 3. Every parameter must be strongly justified. Get rid of parameters like rho, omega, and gamma.
2.  **Re-evaluate FairShare:** The trial_type multiplier didn't work. Instead of trying to modulate fairness in a complex way, go back to the basic idea of incorporating trial_type as a direct effect on utility, or on the *weight* of the fairness component.
3.  **Simpler Loss Aversion:** Get rid of the power law loss aversion. A simple linear loss aversion (lambda * expected_loss if expected_loss < 0, 0 otherwise) might be more identifiable.
4.  **No interaction between Alpha and Combined Earning:** As implemented, it hurts parameter recovery. Avoid it.
5.  **Focus on Core Mechanisms:** Prioritize getting the basic fairness, amount sensitivity, and loss aversion components right before adding complexities.

Be EXTREMELY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters in the model. Aim for an appropriate number of learnable parameters, with a strong bias toward fewer if it improves parameter identifiability. The model should propose a significantly different BIC than previous models, hopefully lower.

When developing your model, reason step by step about:

*   The *most essential* psychological mechanisms involved: fairness, loss aversion, and amount sensitivity. What are the *minimal* number of parameters needed to capture these?
*   How these mechanisms *fundamentally* interact. Are the interactions multiplicative, additive, or something else? Justify your choice based on theory or intuition.
*   What *simple* mathematical form could capture these interactions. Avoid complex functions unless there's a very strong reason. Favor linear or logarithmic functions over power laws.
*   What parameters are *absolutely necessary* to calibrate the model, focusing ruthlessly on potential parameter covariance and identifiability issues. What are the ranges of these parameters?
*   How the *core* model variables map to observable behavior.

Incorporate *strong* prior knowledge or constraints that could reduce parameter covariance and improve parameter identifiability. Given the failure of previous attempts to model trial_type, consider alternative approaches that are more parsimonious. Perhaps trial_type directly modulates the *utility* associated with accepting or rejecting, rather than being part of the fairness calculation.
