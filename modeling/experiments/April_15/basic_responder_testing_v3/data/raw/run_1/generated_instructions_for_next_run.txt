First, think step by step about:
* The key psychological mechanisms involved
* How these mechanisms interact (be explicit about alternative plausible mechanisms or sources of nonlinearity)
* What mathematical form(s) and parameterizations could capture these interactions—including (but not limited to) nonlinearities, thresholds, multiplicative or divisive forms, or interaction terms
* What parameters would be needed to calibrate the model (but aim for maximally independent parameters, with clearly distinct psychological roles)
* How the model variables map to observable behavior (and consider if alternative operationalizations or normalizations would improve interpretability or identifiability)
* How to balance parsimony and interpretability (bias towards fewer learnable parameters, but do not exclude important mechanisms)
* How the parameter values could be recovered from behavior; explicitly consider whether your model may suffer from high parameter collinearity or overfitting

Specific guidance:
- Consider whether new (e.g., non-monotonic or piecewise) relationships between variables might better fit the data.
- Try forms of nonlinearity (e.g., squaring, thresholding, sigmoid, divisive normalization), especially to capture strong shifts or asymptotes in responder behavior.
- Consider interaction or penalty terms beyond additive effects (e.g., multiplicative, max/min, ratio, or softmin/softmax functions).
- Be OPEN to using zero, one, two, or three learnable parameters (not always three!)—if justified by mechanisms.
- Carefully justify inclusion and exclusion of each model term.
- Consider including a stochasticity/noise parameter ONLY if it models true behavioral variability, not just mimics unexplained error.
- Propose at least one subtle twist from the most standard, purely linear models for this task (even if later ruled out).

Your output should:
1. Briefly mention, in your reasoning, at least one alternative eligible psychological mechanism or form not immediately obvious from the task description.
2. Once you’ve reasoned step by step, present a single, well-justified computational model as detailed previously.
3. Provide the model mathematical formula between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES>, as specified in the output format.
4. Specify the target variable within <target_variable> tags.

Be clear, creative, and rigorous in defining how task variables are integrated into your model, and show extra care to reduce parameter correlation and enhance parameter recovery through thoughtful functional form selection and normalization.
