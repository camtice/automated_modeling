The previous best model—a two-parameter log-ratio model—yielded very high parameter recovery and solid overall accuracy/BIC, leveraging reference-dependent utility via normalization (offered/deserved share, log transform). However, its functional form remains monotonic and continuous, and does not allow for the kinds of “regime changes,” discretion, or categorical rejections sometimes seen in game behavior (i.e., “below a certain threshold, always reject”—not easily captured by smooth log functions).

To further enhance parameter identifiability and prediction, the next instructions should motivate trying models that:
- Explicitly account for possible categorical/threshold or “hybrid” effects (i.e., combine continuous sensitivity with discontinuous regime changes).
- Consider asymmetry: rejection may be *very* rapid just below fairness or may depend nonlinearly on the magnitude of under-offering (e.g., nonlinearity only below the fairness point).
- Encourage the exploration of “step” or “piecewise” models—e.g., sharply changing utility below a reference, flat above—potentially with an additional parameter to capture the “rejection regime.”
- Suggest functional forms where the acceptance probability saturates (e.g., softmax, min, or capped penalties) to better match observed switch-like responses.
- Introduce interaction terms or composite variables, such as the sign and magnitude of the offered–deserved gap.
- Urge careful justification if proposing more than two learnable parameters (e.g., only if clearly separable and interpretable), but do not strictly limit parameter count if separation can be justified.
- Urge the modeler to reason, prior to specification, about potential limitations of log-ratio models and the possibility of “psychological cliffs” as evidenced in responder data.
- Specifically demand that the new proposal cover at least one approach not reducible to the monotonic log or linear transforms recently used and encourage innovative hybridizations—e.g., logistic kernel or an explicit “minimum acceptance threshold” parameter.

Encourage the modeler to assess and articulate, step by step, how their proposal would increase predictive fidelity and parameter recovery above a (strong) reference-dependent, two-parameter, log-ratio baseline. Reference how regime change, discontinuity, or asymmetry may yield more distinct and separable parameter effects in fitting, thus improving recovery/BIC. Additionally, if proposing a more complex model, require explicit justification and checks against parameter collinearity.

Include a caution that novelty should not come at the expense of interpretability or parameter identifiability; always reason clearly about whether any added mechanism will produce reliably distinguishable behavioral patterns in simulated/fitted data.

Encourage concise mathematical models—presenting new ideas with minimal jargon and maximal clarity.

**Instructions for Run 4 Computational Modeling**

Before constructing your model, systematically follow each step below and ensure your approach stretches beyond standard forms:

1. **Identify Diverse Psychological Mechanisms**  
   - Enumerate the potential cognitive drivers in responder decisions (e.g., self-interest, fairness norm, aversion to disadvantage, threshold-based rejection, regime-switching).  
   - Explicitly consider whether behavior is better captured by *continuous* (e.g., log, linear) or *categorical/regime-changing* (e.g., step, threshold, piecewise) functions—or a hybrid thereof.

2. **Innovate in Variable Construction and Functional Form**  
   - Go beyond standard normalization: devise composite variables (e.g., sign-magnitude gap, ratio, percent deviation) that reveal underlying patterns or asymmetries.  
   - If modeling thresholds or regime changes, implement these using mathematically explicit forms (e.g., indicator functions, piecewise definitions, soft/hard thresholds).
   - Consider asymmetrical treatment of under- vs. over-reward (e.g., a penalty only for offers below a reference, or sharper slope below fairness).
   - You must include at least one non-monotonic or regime-change/threshold element in your model formulation (e.g., utility drops discontinuously when the offer falls below a computed norm).

3. **Refine Parameterization for Recovery and Interpretability**  
   - If you introduce additional parameters, justify their unique psychological roles and explain in advance why their effects will be distinguishable and recoverable from data.
   - Where possible, limit the number of learnable parameters—*unless* more are genuinely needed to capture unique effects or stepwise/regime shifts.
   - Attentively assess the risk of collinearity among parameters, and adjust your form to maximize unique influence on observable data.

4. **Explicitly Simulate and Argue for Model Advantages**  
   - In your reasoning, compare your model’s expressive power to a reference-dependent log-ratio utility.
   - State clearly and specifically *why and how* your model will yield increased parameter recovery and prediction accuracy (e.g., by capturing sharp decision boundaries, explicit aversion to unfairness, or psychological “cliffs” missed by previous models).

5. **Formatting and Output Requirements**  
   - Use the precise tag format for your output:  
     - <MODEL>…</MODEL> for your model’s formula (mathematical notation only).  
     - <VARIABLES>…</VARIABLES> for detailed JSON variable definitions (meaning, range, learnability, source, etc.).  
     - <target_variable>…</target_variable> to declare the output.  
     - <SUMMARY>…</SUMMARY> to concisely describe the theoretical structure and innovations of your model.

6. **General Advice**  
   - Favor models maximizing interpretability and separable parameter effects over mere novelty.
   - Justify each model component rigorously—do not add features unless they offer distinct explanatory or predictive value.
   - Be explicit and concrete: if proposing a regime-change mechanism, define its mathematical structure, not just its intuition.
   - Ensure the model can be directly and unambiguously computed from the provided dataset.

**Special Nudge Toward Creativity:**  
- You are required to include at least one of the following innovations: explicit threshold or step function, piecewise regime change, asymmetric treatment of unfairness, or an interaction term (e.g., penalty that intensifies for offers especially far below a norm).
- If you choose to stick with a broadly log-ratio or continuous function, you *must* combine it with a regime-switch, indicator, or piecewise structure.

Be rigorous, precise, and out-of-the-box in your model specification and justification.
