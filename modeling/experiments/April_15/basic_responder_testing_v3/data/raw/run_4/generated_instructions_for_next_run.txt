Based on the previous run’s results—specifically, poor parameter recovery for the “penalty_below_threshold” and “sigma_cutoff” parameters, and only moderate accuracy—there’s clear evidence the threshold-based, hybrid “step+continuous” model struggled: it likely suffered from parameter redundancy/collinearity, and its regime-change mechanism was not sufficiently recoverable. This suggests that even though regime shifts are theoretically appealing, their implementation produced parameters whose roles overlapped or failed to manifest separable, robust effects in the observed data.

Conversely, the best models to date have achieved superior parameter recovery and fit with concise, monotonic, reference-dependent forms (especially the two-parameter log-ratio model), likely because each parameter exercised clear, unique control over observable outputs.

Instructions for the next round should:

- Push for solutions that preserve or improve on the psychological interpretability and separability of the log-ratio model, but search for *robust and distinctive* sources of asymmetry, regime change, or decision “cliffs” *without* introducing multiple highly-overlapping parameters.
- Caution strongly against multi-parameter threshold mechanisms unless the “regimes” can be made truly independent and recoverable (e.g., ensure an explicit sharp threshold parameter whose impact cannot be perfectly offset by others).
- Encourage alternatives such as: 
    - Simple, parameter-sparse asymmetric penalty functions (e.g., loss-aversion only for disadvantage; capped or saturating losses; hinge, ReLU, or one-sided power transforms), especially forms that only penalize “below norm.”
    - Single-parameter soft-min or capped loss functions that still permit discontinuity but are easier to recover.
    - Hybrid models that “gate” continuous utility by a single binary or probabilistic regime parameter, but restrict the number of parameters controlling this process to *one*.
    - One-sided nonlinearities (e.g., exponential or squared penalty for below-fairness; zero above).
- Suggest exploring direct interaction terms or composite predictors reflecting *how far* and *in what direction* the offer deviates from the fair norm, and making a clear psychological justification for each mathematical innovation.
- Recommend revisiting and potentially slightly extending the best “log-ratio” model (for example, log relative to deserved with an added asymmetric penalty only for negative deviation), or a simple loss-averse/kinked model, but avoiding overly complex regime-changing models unless parameter identifiability is unambiguous.
- Instruct the modeler to simulate plausible offer distributions and explicitly walk through how each added parameter would translate to *distinct* observable effects.
- Urge that all parameters—especially threshold or penalty terms—be structured so that their influence is not washed out or redundantly absorbed by other parameters, to promote high recovery.

Encourage:
- Experimentation with “single-switch” models (one clear regime breakpoint), piecewise-linear with a soft “max”/“min” function, or non-linearities only below fairness norm.
- Very concise mathematical forms: every parameter should have one clearly interpretable, dimensionally distinct job, and must yield distinct effects on predictions.

Finally, stress that models should remain compatible with the dataset’s structure and, as always, maximize interpretability, parameter recovery, and predictive strength.

**Instructions for Run 5 Computational Modeling**

Before building your formal model, carefully follow these steps—prioritizing creative, robust solutions that maximize parameter recovery, interpretability, and prediction accuracy:

1. **Map Psychological Mechanisms to Distinct Model Components**  
   - List the cognitive drivers at play (e.g., self-interest, reference to fairness norm, aversion to disadvantage, categorical rejection, asymmetric thresholds).  
   - Critically evaluate whether each process truly requires a dedicated parameter, or if it can be captured by a simpler, more recoverable structure.

2. **Strive for Minimal, Distinct Parameterization**  
   - Strongly prefer models in which *each* learnable parameter controls *only one* conceptually unique, non-overlapping effect (e.g., only the steepness of a penalty, only the position of a threshold).  
   - Avoid models where two or more parameters influence the same region of prediction space; parameter redundancy kills recovery.

3. **Innovate with Asymmetry and Discontinuous Sensitivity—But with Simplicity**  
   - Try models that enforce *asymmetric* or *piecewise* effects (e.g., only penalizing under-allocation, or using a “kink” at fairness), but restrict this to *one* extra mechanism, controlled by a single parameter.
   - Possible structures:
     - Add a penalty term that activates only if the offer falls below the fairness norm (e.g., via a max(0, deserved – offer) or indicator).
     - Use a “hinge,” ReLU, or squared-excess penalty, with a single parameter scaling its strength.
     - Consider combining log-ratio utility with a single, saturating penalty term or a capped function for under-offering.
     - Allow for *one* threshold or regime switch at a psychologically justified point—do not combine slope, position, and penalty parameters unless you can provide mathematical proof they can be separately recovered.

4. **Explicitly Assess Each Parameter’s Recoverability**  
   - For every learnable parameter, clearly justify why and how its effects will show up as *distinctive* changes in simulated or fitted data.
   - Demonstrate—before formalizing your model—how your chosen form guards against parameter collinearity and indeterminacy.

5. **Functional Form and Composite Predictors**  
   - Consider creative, psychologically motivated composite predictors (e.g., log or ratio of offer/deserved, or gap from norm), but keep the number of “control knobs” minimal and separable.
   - Test, in your reasoning, that for any regime- or threshold-like effect you include, no other parameter can trivially mimic its influence.

6. **Formatting and Output**  
   - Present the mathematical model in <MODEL>…</MODEL> tags;  
   - Use <VARIABLES>…</VARIABLES> for JSON, fully defining each parameter and computed variable;  
   - State the <target_variable> as required;  
   - Give a concise, technical <SUMMARY> describing the formal structure, innovations, and separability of your model.

7. **General Advice**  
   - Be bold in functional form, but ruthless in parameter economy and identifiability.
   - Consider revisiting or slightly extending strong prior models (e.g., log-ratio utility with one-sided penalty), rather than adding threshold/penalty parameters unless strictly necessary.
   - Ensure models are directly and unambiguously computable from the provided dataset.

**Special Nudge Toward Improvement:**  
- You are *required* to introduce either: (a) an asymmetric or one-sided penalty mechanism for under-offered share, or (b) a single learnable threshold mechanism with *only one* parameter tightly controlling regime change, *not* overlapping with slope or penalty parameters.
- If you employ log-ratio/continuous forms, you must combine these with a single, independently acting mechanism for regime change or nonlinearity, and explain its benefit.
- For any non-standard structure, clearly simulate or walk through its distinctive behavioral signatures.

Foster precision, minimality, and distinctiveness in your design—prioritize steps you can mathematically show will increase both prediction and parameter recovery over prior models.
