From the prior run, it is evident that asymmetric, one-sided linear penalties for under-offering still led to parameter recovery limitations (notably for the “penalty” parameter), despite reasonable psychological interpretability. The most successful prior models (e.g., log-ratio forms) reached excellent parameter recovery when using concise, monotonic, fully multiplicative or reference-dependent effects, and not mixture or additive forms that are triggered only in narrow dynamic ranges. This suggests “piecewise” or “switching” models can introduce locally flat or collinear regions, hurting recoverability, especially where penalties are only active for a subset of trials.

To improve, the next modeling run should:

- Move away from additive, linear, or soft-threshold penalty terms that rely on an indicator or ReLU structure, as these tend to be ill-posed when offer distributions cluster near or far from the threshold, “washing out” parameter effects.
- Prefer strictly monotonic, *smooth* but still asymmetric functions that supplant additive penalty terms. Examples: nonlinear transforms (e.g., exponential, smoothly rectifying powers), or continuous ratio- or log-ratio-based loss aversion, especially with a *single* shape or asymmetry parameter (e.g., a power or “loss aversion” parameter like in prospect theory).
- Explicitly build *interaction* or *modulation* effects; for example, a model where log-ratio sensitivity steepens (or flattens) in the disadvantageous domain, using only one learnable nonlinearity or shape parameter.
- Consider highly recoverable, interpretable nonlinearity from behavioral economics—e.g., prospect theory’s value function: v(x) = x^α if x >= 0, and –λ|x|^β if x < 0—with λ (“loss aversion”) as a single asymmetry parameter, or extend the log-ratio model so that utility = β * log(offer / deserved) when offer >= deserved, and –λ * |log(offer / deserved)|^α otherwise (single switching parameter, but smooth with no hard threshold).

Encourage the following:
- “Smooth regime” models (e.g., exponentiated or power-transformed deviation, or nonlinear reweighting of loss domain), always with *at most* one clearly learnable parameter governing asymmetry or nonlinearity.
- Formulations where parameter effects can be visualized over the entire offer–deserved space and are never “off” for a range of trials.
- Disallow redundant bias/intercept parameters unless strongly justified—prior art shows they often absorb variance inappropriately.
- For “asymmetry,” strictly restrict to one shape/strength or one sharpness parameter, and show it transitions smoothly so its effect cannot be trivially substituted by another parameter.
- If a threshold is used, make it hard (not soft) and make the remainder of the function completely invariant to this location—e.g., a single “kink” at offer=deserved with entirely distinct slopes above/below, or parameterized only by the difference in effect.

Above all: maximize recoverability by preventing overlapping functional forms (no two parameters affect the same space or can compensate for one another anywhere in the observed data).

**Instructions for Run 6 Computational Modeling**

When constructing your formal model for responder choice, rigorously adhere to the following steps to outpace previous models in predictive accuracy, parameter recovery, and interpretability:

1. **Psychological Mechanism–Parameter Mapping**
    - Define the cognitive/psychological drivers (self-interest, proportionality to earned/contributed, loss aversion to under-offering, fairness reference).
    - Each should only have a dedicated parameter if you can demonstrate its quantitative effect is unique, separable, and active across the observed offer space.

2. **Parameterization Principles**
    - Limit your model to *the smallest number* of learnable parameters that each have a mathematically non-redundant influence.
    - No two parameters should act on the same outcome region or statistical moments of the data.
    - Do not introduce intercepts/biases or regime switches unless they yield clearly interpretable independent effects and parameter recovery is guaranteed.

3. **Functional Form Innovation**
    - Prioritize *smooth, monotonic, asymmetric* nonlinearities instead of additive thresholded penalties.
    - Strongly consider “Prospect-Theoretic” forms: for example, use a power or log transformation of the proportional offer deviation, with a single loss aversion/asymmetry parameter modulating the “below-norm” side.
    - Optionally, introduce a multiplicative effect that magnifies the influence of unfairness below the fairness norm, via a shape or steepness parameter.
    - You may choose a sharply kinked but fully piecewise-linear model, provided only a *single* parameter governs the slope on each side of the reference point and transitions are immediate (no overlapping regions of parameter effect).

4. **Simulation-Backed Justification**
    - Before formalizing your model, explicitly consider how *each* parameter’s variation manifests in synthetic or real data (i.e., simulate three to four plausible trials and describe how predictions differ as you change each parameter).
    - Ensure that *across the observed data*, every parameter’s effect is “lit up” and detectable under variation in participant and offer variables.

5. **Model Output and Formatting**
    - Present the formal mathematical model in <MODEL>…</MODEL> tags with *only* the formula (no prose or comments).
    - List all variable descriptions—including range, distributions, learnable/data/calculated status—in <VARIABLES>…</VARIABLES> JSON format as previously specified.
    - State your target variable (likely <target_variable>accept</target_variable>).
    - Summarize your model in <SUMMARY>…</SUMMARY> with a sharply technical, non-generic, and fully descriptive explanation.

6. **Encouraged Model Types (Choose One Only):**
    - *Prospect-Theoretic*: A reference-point utility where deviation above/below (offer/deserved) is transformed by power functions or log with different slopes/weights, with a *single* asymmetry (“loss aversion”) parameter.
    - *Single-Regime-Kinked*: Utility as proportional slope above a fairness norm and another below, controlled by a single asymmetry parameter and no overlap.
    - *Reference-Modulated Exponential/Piecewise*: A model where penalty for disadvantage is exponentially or power-law larger than reward, controlled by a shape parameter.

7. **General Guidance**
    - Only use parameter-rich forms when each parameter’s separate effect can be mathematically guaranteed in the full trial range.
    - Avoid additive bias or “catch-all” terms unless critical; such terms reduce parameter identifiability.
    - Prefer simplicity and continuous action of parameters across the full space of offers.

**Special Emphasis:**
- The model *must* feature a strictly single-parameter asymmetry for unfair offers, implemented via a behavioral-economics/Prospect-Theory-inspired function or a mathematically crisp, immediately active above/below-norm “kink.”
- Do not return to additive one-sided penalties (max(0, …) × parameter) unless using a nonlinear transform that ensures parameter salience and recovery.
- Novel proposals that achieve both a high degree of interpretability and structural parameter identifiability are encouraged.

Be creative, but rigorously inspect separability and mathematical coverage—every parameter must have a reliably observable, independent signature in prediction space.
