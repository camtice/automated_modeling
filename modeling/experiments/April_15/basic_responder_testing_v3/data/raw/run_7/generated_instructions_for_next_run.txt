Although the last model achieved very strong parameter recovery (beta: r = 0.959), it underperformed the overall best model from previous runs in both BIC and accuracy (BIC ~39.8 and accuracy ~0.65 versus BIC = 30.4 and accuracy ~0.78 for the best model, which used a bias + scaled log-ratio as a two-parameter model). This suggests that a pure single-parameter log-ratio, while optimal for recoverability, may be missing either a baseline intercept/bias effect or a more flexible form of nonlinearity.

Further, history shows the best model used a small additive bias alongside the log-ratio, while still avoiding parameter collinearity by explicit normalization—and their summary notes the combination allows for "continuous, reference-dependent loss aversion, minimizes parameter collinearity through explicit normalization, and is highly interpretable for both prediction and psychological inference."

Thus, for this round, instructions should:
- Encourage inclusion of a bias/intercept IF and only IF it is mathematically separable from the main fairness sensitivity, and only after ensuring both parameters are directly interpretable and recoverable.
- Prompt creative exploration of new, monotonic global nonlinearities—such as the use of a softplus or smooth absolute (e.g., log[1 + k·(offer/deserved - 1)]), or parameterized sigmoids—while still strictly avoiding discontinuities or piecewise forms.
- Reiterate that all variables must be normalized (e.g., all shares as percent or relative to deserved), and transformations must be monotonic and smooth everywhere.
- Suggest examining the possibility that a small, constrained additive bias or an alternative smoothly-sloped baseline (e.g., offset inside the log or as a pre-sigmoid additive) could further increase fit and accuracy while still maintaining excellent recovery.
- Strongly encourage providing a clear rationale for how each parameter can be recovered and why the proposed innovation is likely to improve fit over the prior form.
- Continue to discourage "patches" such as max(), if/else, or regime switches in favor of models with fully smooth gradients and separable parameter effects.
- Optionally, recommend the implementation of a bias parameter with an explicit explanation for why it will not interfere with fairness sensitivity estimation.
- Invite out-of-the-box variants, for instance: generalized log-ratio (log(offer/deserved + c)), ratio raised to a global exponent, or activation of a learnable nonlinearity on the log-ratio (e.g., sigmoid or softplus) before or after the main parameter.

The overall goal: maintain or further improve recoverability while reducing BIC and boosting predictive accuracy, via either judicious introduction of a bias/intercept (if justified), a more flexible global nonlinearity, or both.

**Instructions for Run 8 Computational Modeling**

To design an improved responder choice model for this dataset, follow these principles to maximize data fit, parameter recoverability, and interpretability:

1. **Globally-Smooth, Monotonic Reference-Dependent Model**
   - Build utility as a monotonic, smoothly-varying function of the *ratio* between the actual offer and the fairness norm (such as offer/deserved_share, offer/pot_share, etc).
   - Strongly prefer log-ratio or log-transformed ratio models, but do not limit yourself to strict log forms; consider other generalized monotonic, differentiable transforms.

2. **Parameterization: Balance Simplicity and Flexibility**
   - Include up to two *fully separable, interpretable* learnable parameters—generally, a global “fairness sensitivity” (scaling or shaping the reference effect) plus an optional bias/intercept term, maximum, or an alternative smooth baseline term.
   - Any bias/intercept parameter must have a clear, direct effect on model output across all input values without introducing collinearity with the main shape parameter.
   - You may propose novel alternatives to standard bias—e.g., adding an offset inside the log or as a global activation function on the output.

3. **Encourage Innovative, Out-of-the-Box Nonlinearities**
   - Consider smooth, monotonic nonlinearities beyond the log, such as:
     - Power transforms or exponents applied to (offer/deserved_share)
     - Activation functions (e.g., softplus, sigmoid, tanh) applied to the log-ratio or its scaled version
     - A learnable smooth asymmetry parameter modifying slope above/below the fairness point, as long as it is not piecewise
     - Log-ratio with a learnable “floor” parameter for extra robustness, provided all terms remain monotonic
   - Clearly explain how the new transformation or parameter should improve both fit and identifiability.

4. **Strict Bans on Discontinuities and Piecewise Functions**
   - Do not use max(), min(), abs(), if-else, indicator functions, or other discontinuities anywhere in the model.
   - Any asymmetry or loss aversion effect must be smoothly parametrized over the entire range, not only for “loss” or “gain” trials.

5. **Normalization and Psychological Interpretability**
   - All calculations must be in relative/normalized units (percent, share of pot, offer/deserved share).
   - Each parameter should reflect a clear psychological interpretation (e.g., baseline generosity, reference sensitivity, or nonlinear aversion/gain).

6. **Demonstrate Parameter Recoverability**
   - Briefly describe, with each parameter, how varying it would shift predicted acceptance across the dataset and why this separates cleanly from the other parameters.

7. **Precise Output Formatting**
   - Mathematical model goes (and only the equation) between <MODEL>...</MODEL> tags.
   - Variables—in specified JSON format—go between <VARIABLES>...</VARIABLES> tags.
   - State prediction target in <target_variable> tags.
   - Model summary belongs in <SUMMARY> tags—describe model structure and psychological logic only, not task details.

8. **Prioritize Parsimony but Justify Flexibility**
   - Avoid including extra parameters unless you have sound reason (supported by the model’s structure) that they will both enhance fit and remain recoverable and interpretable.
   - Explicitly clarify how each included parameter avoids redundancy or non-identifiability.

**Special Recommendations:**
- If including a bias/intercept, concisely explain how it does not interfere with fairness sensitivity estimation but instead meaningfully improves BIC or accuracy.
- Propose creative nonlinearities that enhance global fit without introducing inference confusion or overlap.
- Above all, ensure every parameter is “live” across all observed data and improvements to fit do not come at the cost of parameter recovery.

Be rigorous, creative, and succinct. The model must be directly implementable given the dataset and the formatting guidelines above.
