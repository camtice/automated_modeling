**INSTRUCTIONS – RUN 19**

Your task is to design a **three-parameter, three-region context-aware computational model** to predict responder (accept/reject) decisions. The central goals are **maximal, measurable parameter recovery** for all learnable parameters, high predictive accuracy, and broad, empirically justified region spread.

---

### 1. **Parameter Recovery: Demonstrable, Monotonic, and Region-Specific**

- Each of the three learnable parameters must drive a *monotonic*, *non-overlapping*, empirically observable change in model utility, active in **more than 85% of trial contexts** for its applicable region.
- **NO parameter may produce a “flat” (<10% change in output) region for >5% of realistic trial types**—demonstrate “activity” with parameter sweeps.
- Include at least one learnable, context-sensitive threshold parameter (sharply separates penalty/bonus regions, moves boundary with trial variables); the *other two* should be amplitude and shape (or curve) parameters for the penalty and bonus regions.
- Simulate and tabulate: For each learned parameter, provide at least two parameter sweep tables showing wide, regular effects across at least two trial types (e.g., high/low pot; high/low contribution).

---

### 2. **Region Structure: Soft & Distinct with Learnable Boundary**

- Regions must be assigned via a **parameterized, learnable, nonlinear soft threshold function** (e.g., sigmoid or mixture)—the threshold point and sharpness should be fit parameters that “move” the boundary *within observed real trial variables*.
    - Encourage threshold = thresh_amp × (context) + thresh_offset or more complex polynomial/interaction forms.
- **Do NOT fix region boundaries or soft-mask steepness**; instead, require the region assignment boundary to be *fit* (so that region coverage can adapt across cohorts/contexts).

---

### 3. **Non-Redundant, Nonlinear Region Utility Functions**

- **For Penalty Region**: Use a form where *shape* distinctly interacts with the penalty curve—suggest log-exp hybrids, or (deficiency + 1) raised to (shape × context), or other non-saturating amplifiers—not a simple exponential or tanh. Prohibit simple powers or mirrored forms.
    - Example: penalty = -penalty_amp × log(1 + exp(penalty_shape × deficiency × context)), or penalty = -penalty_amp × (deficiency + 0.2)^(shape × g(context))
- **For Bonus Region**: Use a *double-nonlinearity* or multiplicative (not additive) combination—bonus utility should be the product of surplus^shape and an amplifying function forced to be monotonic in surplus and context, e.g., bonus_amp × (1 + surplus)^(bonus_shape × context_scaler), or bonus_amp × log(1 + exp(bonus_shape × surplus × some_context)).
- **Under no circumstances** may penalty and bonus regions share the same functional form or nonlinearity.

---

### 4. **Region Spread & Identifiability**

- Simulate region masks for real trial contexts—demonstrate both penalty and bonus region coverage >20% of trials, *under multiple combinations of parameters*.
- Require soft (not hard) region assignment, with mask steepness and threshold point set by **learnable parameters**.

---

### 5. **Model Reporting & Simulation Justification**

- BEFORE your <MODEL>, provide explicit parameter sweep tables (for all learnable parameters) in at least 2 trial types (e.g., high and low contributions/offers), showing monotonic, wide-ranging effects on model output in their region.
- Alongside, show the region mask covers at least 20% of real trial contexts for both regions (table or summary).
- Explicitly state if *any* parameter fails to impact utility meaningfully in realistic trials and re-design as needed.

---

### 6. **Model Output Formatting**

- Place *no commentary* inside the <MODEL>...</MODEL> tags—only mathematical formulae.
- Provide variable and parameter definitions as required, using the precise JSON format previously specified. All variable ranges must be finite and clear.
- Specify your <target_variable> (should be "accept").
- <SUMMARY>: Give a technical, compact summary emphasizing region nonlinearity, context adaptation, explicit learnable region boundary, and how each parameter is fully recoverable/non-redundant.

---

### 7. **Innovation & Distinctiveness Bonus**

- Invent *new* region utility or region mask forms not previously used—try hybrid, polynomial-log, sigmoid-exponential, or layered context amplifiers.
- Reward radical separation of region shape and mask.
- Do NOT produce “mirror” models or models with hidden redundancy.

---

**REMEMBER:**  
Demonstrable, non-redundant, context-adaptive models with explicit fit of region boundaries and sweeping, monotonic parameter effects are required for top performance. Prove parameter identifiability via simulation, not just formula. Out-of-the-box thinking is strongly encouraged.
