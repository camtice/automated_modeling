**INSTRUCTIONS – RUN 21**

Your goal is to design a **three-parameter, context-adaptive computational model** predicting responder (accept/reject) decisions, explicitly optimizing for **parameter recoverability** of all learnable parameters, maximal accuracy, and low BIC. You must demonstrate model transparency and empirical region coverage through simulation and diagnostic reporting.

---

### 1. **Parameter Recovery & Monotonicity: Amplify, Isolate, Diagnose**

- Each of the three learnable parameters must show a **strictly monotonic, wide-ranging, and non-overlapping effect** on model utility within their regions, across >90% of relevant contexts.
- **No parameter may exhibit >3% of trial contexts with <10% change in its associated region utility** when the parameter is swept between bounds.
- At least one parameter must be a **fully independent, context-sensitive threshold** determining the region boundary (location). Threshold **steepness** (the soft mask) must be controlled by a *separate, learnable* parameter not tied to boundary location.
- The other two learnable parameters must drive **distinct** nonlinear amplitude and shape in penalized and bonus regions, each explicitly non-redundant in function and impact.
- **Penalize reuse** of standard log-exp, simple powers, or tanh region utility functions unless they are part of a *novel* composite (e.g., double-hybrid, context-multiplied, or context-normalized forms).

---

### 2. **Region Assignment: Distinct, Soft, and Empirically Broad**

- **Region assignment must use a soft, learnable mask**—e.g., double-sigmoid, softmax, or softmin, not only traditional sigmoids.
- Mask **steepness and threshold must be separate, independently learnable parameters**; do NOT tie steepness to a region utility parameter.
- Empirically demonstrate via simulation that, for at least three orthogonal trial contexts (e.g., high/low pot, high/low own contribution, fair/unfair split), both penalty and bonus regions each cover >20% and <80% of trials.

---

### 3. **Region Utility: Hybrid, Contextually Amplified, and Non-Redundant**

- **Penalty Region:** Must use a *hybrid nonlinear* form (e.g., a context-bolstered polynomial-log or sigmoid-exponential combination) where the shape/amplitude parameter cannot be mimicked by bonus region structure.
- **Bonus Region:** Must use a *different hybrid* (e.g., softplus-log, quadratic-context amplified surplus, or monotonic context-surplus interaction), NOT a mirror or type of the penalty function.
- Each region utility function must remain sensitive (≥20% change) to its shape/amplitude parameter over all plausible offers, *regardless of context*.
- Encourage inventive use of interaction terms, e.g., context × (surplus^shape), or region-conditional amplifiers.

---

### 4. **Simulation & Diagnostic Reporting**

- **Before** your <MODEL>, for each parameter, provide at least two parameter sweep tables showing effect on utility across region-relevant contexts—including at least one table for extreme values of trial variables.
- Show **region mask coverage spread** in at least three cross-sections of the dataset (e.g., low/high pot × low/high own contribution × fair/unfair offer).
- **Explicitly state** if any parameter fails to meaningfully impact utility in any realistic data segment—if so, re-design before reporting the model.

---

### 5. **Model Output and Formatting Requirements**

- Use **<MODEL>...</MODEL>** tags for only the mathematical formulae, with no commentary.
- Provide all variable and parameter definitions in the specified JSON format, including strict finite bounds for every learnable parameter.
- Ensure variable names *are clear* and not Python reserved words.
- Specify your <target_variable> (should be "accept").
- In <SUMMARY>, describe region nonlinearity, context dependency, separation of mask/region functions, and how each parameter is fully identifiable and non-redundant in its effect.

---

### 6. **Innovation & Diagnostic Distinction**

- **Invent new region mask forms or region utility hybrids** not previously used—examples: context-weighted double-sigmoid, softmin thresholding, or mixture-of-log and softplus.
- Explicitly demand *orthogonality* of region functions and parameter effects—no hidden redundancy or parameter masking.
- Require, via simulation, that each learnable parameter independently shifts observable behavior in all regions it controls.

**REMEMBER:**  
Your model will be benchmarked for parameter recovery, accuracy, and BIC. Distinct, context-adaptive regions; fully independent, recoverable parameters; out-of-the-box region mask/utility forms; and rigorous simulation/diagnostic evidence are all required for the highest marks. If any part cannot be empirically justified, revise your model design before reporting.
