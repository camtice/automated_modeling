**INSTRUCTIONS – RUN 23**

Your task is to design a **three-parameter, contextually-adaptive computational model** that predicts responder (accept/reject) choices, with a premium on maximizing **parameter recoverability** (≥0.7 for ALL parameters), accuracy, and low BIC/AIC. Model identifiability and diagnostic transparency are non-negotiable.

---

### 1. **Parameter Recoverability: Separation, Impact, Orthogonality**

- Each learned parameter **must** have a **strictly monotonic, wide, and non-overlapping** impact on model utility within its assigned region **across >95% of trials** (*run explicit parameter sweeps and demonstrate*).
- No parameter may have **<30% utility range** across at least three principal dataset cross-sections, defined by: (a) high/low own contribution, (b) high/low pot, and (c) fair/unfair splits.
- **Each of the three parameters must be independently and strongly recoverable**; prioritize designs that isolate effects (e.g., context/dataset simulation where each parameter's effect is clear and not overwhelmed by the others).
    - *Diagnose and explicitly reparametrize if any one parameter's sweep does not visibly change model output or region boundary in all realistic cases.*

---

### 2. **Region Mask: Inventiveness and Independence**

- **Invent a region-softening mask** that is *not* a standard sigmoid; e.g. double-softmax, askew-softplus, or context-sensitive mixture of sigmoids. Mask *threshold* and *steepness* must remain fully independent, learnable parameters, both demonstrably recoverable.
- Consider introducing **context-scaling** of mask steepness—but only if the context effect is orthogonal and does not sacrifice identifiability.
- **Diagnose region coverage by simulation**: both penalty and bonus regions must each span >25% and <75% of trial contexts for representative (orthogonal) cross-sections.
- If coverage is too sharp/narrow, *broaden the mask* by construction (e.g., using temperature controls, multiple inflection points).

---

### 3. **Region Utility: Hybridization, Distinction, and New Interactions**

- **Penalty and bonus region utilities must each use a distinct, composite hybrid:** e.g. context-modulated power-log for penalty, and quadratic softplus or context-amplified exponential for bonus—neither should reduce to a standard tanh, log-exp, or plain polynomial.
    - *At least one region utility must use an explicit shape parameter (exponent or base), not just amplitude, to ensure identifiability and empirical sweep diagnostics.*
    - Utility parameters should not simply scale effects; instead, **control shape or nonlinearity** in each region in an interpretable, non-redundant way.
- All utility functions must remain **highly sensitive (≥30% change) to their associated parameter** for all realistic parameterizations and in all major dataset cross-sections.

---

### 4. **Simulation & Diagnostic Proof**

- **Before your <MODEL> block**, for each parameter:
    - Show at least two sweep tables: effect on utility across region-relevant cross-sections, including extreme values (e.g., unfair/fair/generous splits, high/low effort, large/small pot).
    - Show region mask coverage across at least three orthogonal cross-sections (not just the average)—state empirical % of trials in each region.
    - *Explicitly flag if (and where) any parameter fails to impact utility or mask, and re-design if this occurs.*

---

### 5. **Formatting and Output Strictness**

- Mathematical formulae only inside **<MODEL>...</MODEL>** tags; *no commentary inside*.
- All parameter and variable definitions in the required JSON block (**<VARIABLES>...</VARIABLES>**) with strict, finite bounds.
- All variable and parameter names must be **clear, unique, and not Python reserved words**.
- Specify your target variable as **<target_variable>accept</target_variable>**.
- In **<SUMMARY>**, detail: region nonlinearity, context dependency, region assignment/mask innovation, and demonstrate that every parameter is independently, orthogonally, and reliably recoverable.

---

### 6. **Inventiveness & Explicit Isolation**

- *Invent* new region masks and utility forms; do not default to standard sigmoid or log-exp unless part of an innovative hybrid.
- If you use any standard function, it must be part of a clearly non-redundant, composite, and contextually unique construction.
- *Explicitly require* by simulation that every parameter can be robustly recovered and is not masked by other effects—if not, redesign.
- Bonus: Prefer region-conditional cross-terms (e.g., context × (surplus^shape)), multiplexed thresholding, or mask forms with built-in “temperature” control for flexible region size.
- If a region uses an amplitude parameter, ensure the other region uses a *distinct* shape/curvature parameter (not both pure scales).

**REMEMBER:**  
You are being evaluated on parameter recoverability (ALL r > 0.70), accuracy, and efficiency (BIC). Be bold: prioritize new region structures, context-aware interactions, transparent parameterization, and simulation diagnostics for each parameter.
