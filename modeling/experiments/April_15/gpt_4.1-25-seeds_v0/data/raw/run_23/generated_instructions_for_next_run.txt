**INSTRUCTIONS – RUN 24**

Your task is to design a **three-parameter, contextually-adaptive computational model** for responder accept/reject choices. Your model must maximize **parameter recoverability** (≥0.7 for EVERY parameter), accuracy, and minimize BIC/AIC. Novelty and diagnostic transparency are required.

---

### 1. **Parameter Recoverability & Explicit Independence**

- Each learned parameter must create a **strictly monotonic, wide, and non-overlapping** impact on model utility within its assigned region **across ≥95% of all trial contexts**.  
- For EVERY parameter, provide at least **two sweep tables** showing their explicit and strong (>30% range) effect in at least three principal data cross-sections:  
    (a) high/low own contribution,  
    (b) high/low pot,  
    (c) fair/unfair/very generous splits.
- You **must not** allow parameter effects (especially mask steepness and threshold) to interact in a way that harms individual recoverability. Context modulation of mask should only occur **additively** to avoid multiplicative entanglement.
- For the third parameter (bonus/penalty utility), its entire effect should be demonstrated through region-restricted parameter sweeps, ensuring it does NOT correlate with threshold or steepness during pseudo-data recovery.

---

### 2. **Region Mask: Innovation & Proof of Coverage**

- Invent a **region-assignment mask** that is NOT a basic sigmoid, logit, or tanh. Try new forms:
    - e.g., the **difference of two shifted logistic functions** (“window mask”),
    - a **power-root mask**: mask = (|surplus-threshold|/scale)^power then squashed to [0,1],
    - a “ramp-softmax” that transitions by a controllable plateau then soft ramp.
- Mask **threshold** and **steepness/shape** must be fully independent, each directly controlling mask position and width, **with empirical sweep to prove it**.
- Show **empirical region coverage** at three cross-sections: each region must cover >25% and <75% of relevant trials for any valid parameterization.

---

### 3. **Distinct Contextual Utilities: Full Hybridization**

- The **penalty region utility** must be a hybrid (e.g., negative exponential-log-power, or context-amplified negative root), and have a unique, separable nonlinearity/shape parameter—not just an amplitude.
- The **bonus region utility** must use a different parameter (e.g., context × (surplus^shape) or surplus × log(1+context×surplus)), whose effect is strictly confined to the bonus region.
- At least one **shape/amplification parameter** must modulate curvature (power, exponent, or log-base), NOT just amplitude, and must be recoverable from bonus (generous) offers alone.
- Demonstrate, via cross-section sweeps, that each region utility is **unresponsive to other region’s parameter** (orthogonality criterion).

---

### 4. **Simulation Diagnostics & Redundancy Checks**

- **Before presenting <MODEL>**, include a concise “critical commentary” stating how your model achieves clear, non-redundant recoverability.
- Provide for **each parameter**:
    - Two utility sweep tables (utility vs parameter across split/fairness/pot cross-sections).
    - Empirical demonstration that region assignment (mask) and utilities yield broad empirical coverage and independent parameter effects.
- Explicitly **rule out parameter redundancy**:  
    - Briefly report how you determined (e.g., by simulation) that each parameter is recoverable and not masked by other effects (run partial correlation or utility contrast simulations if possible).
    - If any redundancy or weak recoverability is seen, you MUST reparameterize your model.

---

### 5. **Strict Formatting and Output**

- **Mathematical expressions only** in <MODEL>…</MODEL> (no commentary inside).
- All variable and parameter definitions in strict JSON block as in prior instructions with fully finite bounds.
- All parameter/variable names must be clear, unique, and Python-safe.
- Target variable: <target_variable>accept</target_variable>.
- In <SUMMARY>, succinctly specify region nonlinearities, exact context dependency, region assignment innovation, and parameter recoverability evidence.

---

### 6. **Inventiveness, Separation, and Evidence**

- Try out-of-the-box hybrid mask designs and regionarily unique utilities.
- Explicitly avoid any structure that historically yields parameter entanglement or unexplained low recovery.
- For extra credit: include a *region-conditional cross-term* in utilities (e.g., context × surplus^shape, only in one region), or a mask with two “soft” inflection points.
- Models without explicit, non-redundant, and highly recoverable parameters will be penalized.
- Supply simulation-backed commentary on parameter independence before <MODEL>.

**REMEMBER:**  
Be bold—prioritize transparent and diagnostic parameterization, novel region/mask forms, and deliver simulation-backed evidence for parameter recoverability and interpretability. All parameters must show >0.70 recovery (in simulation), high accuracy, and low BIC.
