Before designing your computational model, carefully address the following steps:

1. **Identify Psychological and Behavioral Mechanisms:**
   - Go beyond basic self-interest and fairness—explicitly consider mechanisms like biased fairness perception, loss aversion, *thresholds* for rejection, nonlinear or discontinuous (stepwise) responses, or diminishing sensitivity to unfairness at extremes.
   - Consider if fairness deviations are felt more acutely depending on the *context* (e.g., only when stakes are sufficiently high, or proportional to minimum possible share).

2. **Explicitly Distinguish Parameter Roles for Identifiability:**
   - For each learnable parameter, ensure it governs a unique, orthogonal psychological function (e.g., distinct nonlinear, stepwise, or multiplicative effects).
   - Avoid using multiple parameters to capture similar types of fairness aversion unless you can guarantee non-overlapping effects (e.g., use max/min, threshold indicators, or non-monotonic functions).
   - Briefly justify how your model structure reduces parameter redundancy and enhances recoverability in simulation.

3. **Innovate in Functional Forms and Interactions:**
   - Move beyond linear additive combinations—consider discontinuous or threshold utilities, interaction terms, or nonlinear (ratio, piecewise, exponential/logit, etc.) transformations.
   - Explore if an explicit *rejection cutoff* (e.g., a fairness threshold, or minimal acceptable offer) or contextual modulation (e.g., unfairness aversion increases as own share decreases) might better fit responder behavior.
   - If you introduce nonlinearities, clearly specify and justify them in your reasoning.

4. **Variable Usage and Mapping:**
   - Ensure every term in your model is directly computable from the provided dataset.
   - Define each derived variable and parameter clearly, strictly following the output format, and ensure no two variables/parameters are functionally redundant.

5. **Parsimony and Psychological Interpretability:**
   - Strive for the simplest model capable of capturing key patterns without sacrificing parameter recoverability.
   - Avoid excessive parameterization; two or three well-identified learnable parameters are preferred.

6. **Formalization and Output Requirements:**
   - Provide your detailed reasoning before your formal model.
   - Place your complete mathematical model in <MODEL> tags.
   - List and fully document all variables and parameters (with explicit, finite bounds for all learnable parameters) in JSON format between <VARIABLES> tags.
   - Specify the exact predicted target variable between <target_variable> tags.
   - Offer a concise, descriptive <SUMMARY> of your model (without referencing task names).
   - Use parameter names that are Python-compatible and not reserved words.

*Remember:* Out-of-the-box approaches are encouraged, especially those that boost predictive fit and parameter identifiability in simulation, even if they are not the most obvious or standard solution. Consider, for example, threshold logic, ratio-based functions, explicit discontinuities, or interaction terms, if they enhance psychological realism and recoverability.
