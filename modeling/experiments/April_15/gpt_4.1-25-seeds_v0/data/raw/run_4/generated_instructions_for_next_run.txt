Before designing your computational model, address each step below carefully and creatively:

1. **Pinpoint Key Nonlinear and Contextual Mechanisms:**
   - Go beyond linear or basic threshold models. Explicitly identify if discontinuities (e.g., step changes, indicator functions), saturation, or asymmetric aversion to unfairness (e.g., rejection is much more likely for disadvantageous unfairness than advantageous) are plausible.
   - Consider mechanisms like: utility “plateaus” (accepts everything above a cutoff, rejects below), or risk aversion tied to context (offers from a larger pot might provoke stronger reactions to unfairness).
   - If loss/gain asymmetry is relevant, distinguish between reactions to offers below versus above a fairness reference point.

2. **Achieve Orthogonal, Unique Parameter Effects and Identifiability:**
   - For each learnable parameter, justify in advance how you ensure that it cannot be substituted by others—describe how each parameter modulates distinct psychological processes.
   - Avoid using multiple “slope” or “threshold” parameters unless they operate on fully distinct regions (“one for self-interest, one only for severe unfairness,” for example).
   - Explicitly anticipate and prevent parameter tradeoff or redundancy through your model structure and provide reasoning for how your functional form supports parameter recovery.

3. **Innovate with Functional Forms:**
   - Shun purely additive combinations; instead, consider forms such as:
        - Piecewise functions
        - max(0, x) or min logic (cutoffs, floors, ceilings)
        - Quadratic, exponential, or log transformations of core variables
        - Interaction terms (e.g., unfairness aversion rises with pot size, or with absolute deviation)
        - Explicit “zones” (e.g., utility = very low for offers < threshold, increases rapidly after)
   - If using a threshold or cutoff, consider a *hard* or sigmoidal switch, not just linear utility.

4. **Exploit Both Absolute and Proportional Fairness:**
   - Model may include terms for both absolute offer size and fairness relative to entitlement or contribution.
   - Map all model terms directly to available data fields; define and justify every derived variable.

5. **Prioritize Parsimony and Psychological Interpretability:**
   - Prefer models with two or three learnable, non-overlapping parameters—each with a clear, unique psychological meaning.
   - Unless strongly justified, avoid “extra” parameters; focus on quality, not quantity, of effects.
   - Describe in your reasoning how these parameters can be meaningfully recovered from observable behavior.

6. **Formalization and Output Requirements:**
   - Provide thorough, stepwise reasoning before formalizing your model.
   - Place the full mathematical model in <MODEL> tags—do not add text or explanation inside these tags.
   - List and document all variables and parameters (with explicit, finite numeric bounds for learnable parameters) in JSON format between <VARIABLES> tags.
   - Specify the exact predicted target variable between <target_variable> tags.
   - Give a concise, purely descriptive <SUMMARY> (no mention of task names).
   - Use Python-safe, non-reserved names for all parameters and variables.

**Challenge yourself to try formulations with clear discontinuity, nonlinearity, or asymmetric effects. Favor compact, well-identified parameters over “more is better.” Be bold in exploring threshold, zone-based, or interactional mechanisms. If you use a fairness threshold, ensure its effect is direct and does not blend with other parameters.**
