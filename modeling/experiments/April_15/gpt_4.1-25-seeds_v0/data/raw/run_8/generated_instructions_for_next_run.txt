**INSTRUCTIONS – RUN 9**

Your task is to design a computational model of responder (accept/reject) choice using the provided dataset. Your principal goals are: (1) maximize the recoverability and interpretability of ALL learnable parameters, (2) improve model fit (BIC/accuracy), and (3) ensure the model captures psychologically plausible, nonlinear, and context/fairness-sensitive mechanisms that go beyond naïve additive forms.

Please rigorously adhere to this revised process:

1. **Enforce Strict Nonoverlap of Parameter Effects:**
   - Each learnable parameter must govern a conceptually and mathematically *distinct* region of the model:
     - One parameter for threshold placement (e.g., personalized fairness threshold).
     - One parameter for penalty below threshold (strength/shape of unfairness aversion).
     - One parameter for bonus or acceptance steepness above threshold, or a distinct slope—but NO TWO parameters may jointly scale the same penalty or region.
   - Additive or multiplicative combinations of learnable parameters on the same process are **NOT permitted**.
   - All “context sensitivity” features must act through a *separately parameterized distinct* effect, not by directly modulating another parameter's impact.

2. **Loss/Gain Asymmetry & Nonlinear Transitions:**
   - The model **must** include explicit, separate treatment of offers *below* versus *above* the fairness threshold, with different penalties/bonuses or functionals (e.g., step, log, indicator, softplus, saturating effect).
   - Use at least one *nonlinear* penalty or reward (log, indicator, softplus, etc.) in a way that allows easy visual separation in toy curves.

3. **Parameter Recovery and Toy Curve Diagnostics:**
   - In your reasoning, explicitly theorize how changing each parameter—holding others at midrange—would uniquely shift the acceptance curve (e.g., left/right movement, change in steepness, penalty strength).
   - For at least two hypothetical profiles (e.g., fairness fundamentalist, greedy egalitarian), explain qualitatively how model fits would differ.

4. **Threshold as Learnable, Not Fixed:**
   - Threshold should be a bounded, learnable proportional scaling of the entitlement amount—not forced to literal proportional split.
   - Explicitly tie threshold to contextual variables (e.g., tau_fairness × entitlement).

5. **Strict Parameter Limit and Variable Description:**
   - Maximum three (3) learnable parameters, each with wide, inclusive, **non-overlapping** bounds.
   - Each parameter must be mapped to a single psychological mechanism or region.
   - All mathematical variables used in <MODEL> must be described in the <VARIABLES> JSON schema.
   - Always specify the prediction target.

6. **Prohibited Practices:**
   - Purely additive linear models are forbidden.
   - No more than one learnable parameter can affect any single region of the model (e.g., penalty strength, exponent, and context scaling cannot all jointly govern below-threshold utility).
   - Do NOT have a parameter that both sets threshold and also scales penalty/bonus.

7. **Model Output & Format:**
   - Walk through your reasoning before presenting the model.
   - Embed your mathematical model only between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags.
   - List variables/parameter descriptions only between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> (Python-safe names).
   - Show the target variable in <target_variable> tags.
   - Give a concise, descriptive summary ONLY between <SUMMARY> tags.

**MANDATORY CREATIVE CHALLENGE:**  
Implement at least one of the following (specify your choice in reasoning):

- (A) Explicit, parameterized loss/gain asymmetry, e.g., penalty for unfair offers distinct from bonus for generous offers.
- (B) Use of a nonlinear or saturating function (log, softplus, tanh, or step) for sub- and/or suprathreshold utility, with learnable magnitude or steepness.
- (C) Contextual effect as a separate, parameterized bonus/penalty (not by scaling penalty regions), such as a reward for generosity in large pots.
- (D) Any highly interpretable model structure enabling truly separable parameter recovery.

Think creatively but rigorously, and ground each parameter in a clear psychological hypothesis—especially regarding fairness, strictness, generosity, or contextual awareness.
