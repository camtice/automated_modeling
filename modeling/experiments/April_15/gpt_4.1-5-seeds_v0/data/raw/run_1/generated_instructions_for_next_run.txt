- The previous instructions (and likely subsequent models) emphasize balancing parameter parsimony and psychological realism, but parameter recovery for "alpha_self" and "bias" is notably weaker than for "alpha_fair".
- Multicollinearity between self-interest and fairness parameters probably impairs recovery; the two terms as constructed both depend on split_self, possibly causing redundancy.
- There are additional sources of “fairness” signals in the dataset (e.g., splitperc_self, splitperc_opp) that might clarify fairness deviations, or a non-linear treatment of fairness deviations might reduce redundancy.
- The model is not explicitly utilizing opponent-centric fairness (“disadvantageous” vs. “advantageous” inequality), nor does it model possible threshold or "rejection zone" effects. Alternative forms (e.g., using absolute deviations, or piecewise penalties) might yield better identifiability.
- There is room for improving parameter recovery by:
    - Encouraging the isolation of collinear terms (e.g., use deviation score only, or construct terms orthogonally).
    - Suggesting non-linear transforms (e.g., using |split_self − fair_share| or indicator functions for “unfair” offers).
    - Considering alternative measures of fairness, possibly capturing aversion to both being under-offered and over-offered, as in Fehr-Schmidt–style models.
    - Suggesting or allowing constraint for some parameters (e.g., weighting fairness aversion parameter to be ≥0).
    - Pointing out that high bias for lower parameter count should not overshadow testability or psychological theorizing.

- Modelers should be encouraged to:
    - Explore models that go beyond linear combinations of monetary/fairness motives, especially non-linear effects or piecewise penalties.
    - Think about including or manipulating "inequality aversion" to distinguish between different fairness violations, not just deviations from fair share.
    - Reflect on including "rejection thresholds" (i.e., utility becomes sharply negative under certain conditions).
    - Consider utilizing all available data (possibly testing constructs such as percent splits) where they might uniquely identify a psychological mechanism.

**Updated Instructions for Run 2:**

Be strategically critical of parameter redundancy and high covariance, aiming for strong parameter recovery as well as interpretability and fit. 

First, before formalizing a model, reason step by step about:
* What distinct psychological processes (self-interest, fairness aversion, social reference, etc.) may drive responder behavior in this context.
* Whether these motives interact linearly or non-linearly, and whether threshold, piecewise, or asymmetric (e.g., disadvantageous vs. advantageous inequality) effects may be present.
* How to mathematically structure the model to minimize redundancy: for example, can fairness/inequity be represented via a single orthogonal term rather than overlapping with monetary terms? Should you use deviation, percent difference, or an indicator function?
* Whether non-linear penalties for unfairness (e.g., absolute value, squared difference, step/indicator, or asymmetric treatment of unfair splits) could disentangle parameters and improve recovery.
* How best to set parameter constraints (e.g., non-negativity for aversion parameters) to further decrease redundancy and ensure interpretable roles.

When developing your model:
- Explicitly address the risk of collinearity between parameters. If using fairness and self-interest, justify how their effects can be uniquely identified, or merge them into a single interpretable metric.
- Consider employing alternative fairness constructs (e.g., Fehr-Schmidt: punish only disadvantageous/advantageous inequality, or piecewise loss-function for unfair offers).
- Allow for out-of-the-box modeling approaches including non-linear, piecewise, or “threshold”/stepwise mechanisms, especially if these could differentiate between hypotheses or improve parameter recovery.
- Think about whether utilizing percentage-based splits or other available variables could introduce new, orthogonal information to the model.
- Prioritize models that can be robustly recovered from data with minimal mutual dependence between learnable parameters, even if this results in changes from strictly linear models.

Once you have reasoned about these steps, then and only then provide your model specification and variable descriptions.
