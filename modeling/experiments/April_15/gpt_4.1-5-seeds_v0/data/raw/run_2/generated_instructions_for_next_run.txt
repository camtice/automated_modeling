The previous instructions encouraged moving away from linear combinations of self-interest and fairness—especially to avoid collinearity—and explored Fehr-Schmidt–style models, piecewise penalties, and threshold mechanisms using percent-based deviations. However, model performance (accuracy, BIC, parameter recovery) was still suboptimal, especially in parameter recovery (notably negative or weak recovery for some parameters).

To improve, new instructions should:

- Push the modeler to test *distinct* non-linear or non-continuous features:
    - For example, explicit “acceptance thresholds” (stepwise/indicator functions), or using quantiles/ranks rather than continuous differences, to model strong rejections below a certain fairness standard.
    - Explore non-monotonic utility shapes (e.g., U- or S-shaped fairness sensitivity).
    - Use softmax/soft-threshold approaches to balance interpretable steep effects and gradient-based fitting.
    - Consider stochasticity or lapse rates if noise or unmodeled variability could explain parameter recovery issues.
- Suggest hybrid models:
    - For example, combine a threshold/floor effect (utility very low below a threshold percent) with a smooth penalty for additional unfairness, or multiply fairness and self-interest in a non-linear way (instead of adding).
    - Use multiplicative interactions between fairness and self-interest.
    - Try “minimum acceptable offer” as a learnable parameter (with or without additional fairness weighting).
    - Trial-specific “anchoring” (e.g., reward difference to a social standard), or “reference-dependent” models where the response is based on distance to the closest categorical standard (e.g., equality vs. contribution-based fairness).
- Explicitly ask the modeler to consider parameter recoverability during the design phase:
    - Propose/contrast 1-parameter (threshold or step) vs. multi-parameter (penalty gradient) models.
    - Emphasize transparent orthogonality among model terms: parameters should ideally respond to distinguishable behavioral patterns, not the same source of variance.
- Push for the use of all relevant variables, or at least investigator justification when simplifying.
- Remind to bound parameters meaningfully (e.g., min threshold within possible percent ranges, fairness weights strictly non-negative unless theory demands otherwise).

Explicitly encourage proposals that are:
- Non-additive (multiplicative or max/min schemes).
- Based on indicator or “hurdle” mechanics, not solely continuous penalties.
- Actively evaluated for the ease of parameter separation by simulated recovery checks.

Invite the modeler to sketch several plausible variants before formalizing, including at least one unconventional utility formulation.

**Updated Instructions for Run 3:**

Continue to prioritize both psychological interpretability and mathematical identifiability of your models. Model proposals should critically address parameter recovery and avoid hidden redundancy.

**Before formalizing a model, complete this stepwise reasoning:**
1. Describe the likely distinct psychological processes driving responder behavior (e.g., self-interest, aversion to unfairness, satisficing, thresholding, “minimum acceptable offer”, lapse/noise).
2. Assess whether these motives are best captured with linear, non-linear, piecewise, threshold/indicator, or multiplicative/interaction effects—and what behavioral patterns each form is hypothesized to generate (e.g., abrupt rejection below fairness standard, smooth gradients, insensitivity above threshold).
3. For each candidate model, explain how its parameters are expected to relate to *unique* behavioral patterns in the data (i.e., that parameter recovery will be robust and low in inter-parameter correlation).
4. Explicitly consider models with the following features:
    - Step or “hurdle” effects (e.g., utility drops sharply when split_self falls below a learnable threshold).
    - Non-additive or multiplicative terms (e.g., interaction between fairness and self-interest, or fairness penalty scaled by self-interest).
    - Minimum acceptable offer as a direct, learnable parameter.
    - Non-monotonic or “reference-dependent” models (e.g., utility highest at either equality or earned share, and falls with distance in either direction).
    - Explicitly modeled lapse or stochastic noise (additive random term, or probability lapse).
5. Use all relevant variables (splitperc_self, token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, etc.) and justify the selection.
6. Set meaningful, theory-consistent bounds for all parameters (e.g., thresholds within the [0,100] percent range, fairness aversion ≥0, bias/intercept as needed).

**When developing your model:**
- Compare at least two structurally distinct approaches—at least one should use a threshold, indicator, or piecewise function, and at least one should use an interaction (multiplicative or otherwise non-additive).
- Comment on the expected ease of parameter recovery for each.
- Avoid direct linear-additive combinations unless you can argue their parameters are reliably separable.
- Prioritize models likely to yield robust, high-accuracy predictions *and* strong parameter recovery even in the presence of noisy data.
- Present your final mathematical model and variable specifications as clearly structured.

**Encouragement:**
Do not hesitate to propose unconventional or hybrid models (e.g., max/min, softmax thresholding, indicator-triggered penalties, or combinations of self-interest and fairness in multiplicative or non-standard ways). Short-list and then select/justify the most promising based on the above reasoning—don’t default to the expected solution.

After this rigorous reasoning, provide your single formal model specification and variable descriptions as instructed.
