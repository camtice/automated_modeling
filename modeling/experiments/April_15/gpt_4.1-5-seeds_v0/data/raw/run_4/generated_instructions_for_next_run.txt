The current best model is a 1-parameter threshold (minimum acceptable percent), which yields strong parameter recovery (r ≈ 0.92) and excellent fit (accuracy ≈ 0.82, low BIC). However, further improvements might be possible if a slightly more expressive model can match (or improve) fit and BIC while retaining identifiability—WITHOUT sacrificing recovery. Past multi-parameter models failed due to collinearity or lack of clear parameter-functional separation.

In this run, the LLM should be motivated to pursue models that:

1. **Add the absolute minimal theoretical complexity above the winning threshold model**—ideally, at most one extra parameter, and only if its "recoverable behavioral role" is utterly clear and non-overlapping. E.g., a constant *acceptance bias* (captures personality or random response tendency) or a *clear, interpretable asymmetry* (advantage/disadvantage aversion) that doesn't mix with thresholding.
2. **Consider the weaknesses of the threshold model**: Some participants show smoother/graded acceptance curves, accepting slightly below threshold, possibly due to stochasticity or fairness motivations. If possible, model this without introducing entanglement between threshold and slope (e.g., use a *steepness* parameter but fix the threshold, or vice versa—never make both free at once).
3. **Explicitly rule out any model proposal with redundant, substitutable, or overlapping parameter effects unless it can be proven (by logic) to recover on simulated "mixed" response types.**
4. **Try at least one non-linear or piecewise functional form that is still interpretable—e.g., using an asymmetric penalty, or a min/max composite, or an "AND" gate between threshold and fairness.** (This targets responders who require both “enough” and “fairness.”)
5. **Test "reference-dependent" forms**, e.g., a single-parameter fairness penalty (absolute or squared deviation from the merit share) vs. threshold—compare their error patterns and consider combining only if each explains genuinely unique error, not just similar variance with different labels.
6. **If proposing a two-parameter model, construct a *synthetic dataset (in your reasoning, not code)* that would allow each parameter to be uniquely estimated, and describe exactly which features of the data pin down each.** If this can’t be argued, stick with single-parameter models.
7. **Whenever possible, favor a step (indicator or Heaviside), piecewise-linear, or max/min functional form for clarity of parameter meaning and recovery.**
8. **Strongly caution against lapses or error/noise parameters that just absorb left-over variance**—only admit them if strong theoretical justification, and bound them tightly.
9. **Define all parameter bounds strictly (unless theoretically impossible), and avoid any unbounded learnable parameter.**

Encourage the modeler: Even if the 1-parameter threshold model remains best, challenge yourself for "minimal +1" variations that may capture non-threshold aspects (sharpness/asymmetry/bias/fairness) without introducing collinearity.

Finally, always ensure recovery logic is explicit: for every parameter, state how an experimenter or statistician would uniquely estimate this parameter in the presence of noise and mixed response patterns.

**Instructions for Run 5:**

---

**Objective:**  
Develop a computational model of responder choice that (a) maximizes prediction accuracy, (b) minimizes BIC, and (c) achieves strong, demonstrable parameter recovery for all learnable parameters. The model should be interpretable, mathematically identifiable, and justified from behavioral theory and practical data analysis experience.

**Rigorous Modeling Workflow:**

1. **Theory Mapping:**  
   Clearly map which psychological mechanisms your model represents: thresholding, self-interest, fairness aversion, bias, noise, etc. Consider abrupt (discontinuous), smooth, and hybrid response patterns.

2. **Model Construction:**  
   - Build at least two plausible, *fundamentally distinct* models:
     - (a) An improved “minimal threshold” model (e.g., a step function or threshold with a single parameter).
     - (b) A “minimal +1” variant: add at most one parameter—for instance, a fairness penalty (deviation from merit), acceptance bias, or graded slope/steepness—**but only if** its recoverability and unique role can be explicitly justified and *empirically separated* in simulated logic.
   - Consider at least one “nonlinear” model: e.g., piecewise, max/min, or "AND"/"OR"-type gating, where utility is determined by the most limiting factor (e.g., min(selfishness, fairness)).
   - Propose one “reference-dependent” model: acceptance probability falls with deviation from a fairness/merit point (try single-parameter absolute or quadratic deviation forms).

3. **Parameter Separability Evidence:**  
   - For **every parameter**, briefly explain which feature of the data or decision pattern uniquely identifies its value (e.g., sharp drop-off for threshold, baseline shift for bias, asymmetric rejections for advantage vs. disadvantage aversion).
   - For **multi-parameter models**, construct a hypothetical data scenario (in your reasoning) where each parameter would be independently and robustly estimable. If this fails for any parameter, remove it.

4. **Collinearity and Identifiability:**  
   - Formally argue whether any two parameters in your model could compensate for each other or be mutually confounded in practice.
   - Prefer models where all parameters have non-overlapping, orthogonal influence on predicted probabilities.

5. **Functional Form Clarity:**  
   - Strongly prefer indicator, max/min, or piecewise forms for interpretability and identifiability, unless continuous forms (e.g., high-slope sigmoids) are clearly justified.
   - Avoid “hybrid” models unless every term explains unique, theoretically founded behavior that a threshold alone can’t capture.

6. **Parameter Bounds:**  
   - Specify **strict, plausible bounds** for every learnable parameter (e.g.: thresholds in [0,100], penalty strengths ≥ 0, bias in a finite range).

7. **Model Parsimony and Justification:**  
   - Simpler is better—do not increase model complexity unless all added parameters are expected to yield both (a) real improvements in fit *and* (b) no loss of recovery or interpretability.

8. **Noise/Lapse Parameters:**  
   - Only include a noise/lapse parameter with strong behavioral evidence and a tight a priori bound. Otherwise, omit or fix them.

9. **Final Output Requirements:**  
   - Present only your best, *fully justified* model.
   - Include model equation in <MODEL> tags, variable dictionary in <VARIABLES> (precise, with bounds, matching names as code variables), and a concise, non-generic explanatory summary in <SUMMARY> tags.
   - Specify the <target_variable> exactly.
   - Avoid extraneous description—each field should be self-contained and ready for direct code and parameter extraction.

**Encouragement:**  
- Think “minimal +1” rather than "kitchen sink": What *single* added (and recoverable) behavioral tendency beyond pure thresholding might meaningfully increase model performance?
- Consider “outside the box”—experiment with max/min, logical-gate, or asymmetric forms.
- Argue why your model captures *unique, observable variance* that a basic threshold cannot, and state how each parameter would be meaningfully and robustly estimated in noisy human data.
