Please carefully design your computational model with the following steps and considerations. The goal is to maximize model fit (minimize BIC), improve predictive accuracy, and achieve high, dissociable parameter recovery for every learnable parameter.

1. **Reason step by step** through:
   - The central psychological mechanisms active in the task.
   - How these mechanisms are likely to interact or trade off, including any possible **nonlinearities**, **thresholds**, or **interaction effects** in the behavioral response (e.g., sharply increased rejection once unfairness passes a certain point, or disadvantage aversion mattering only beyond threshold).
   - What mathematical form best captures these processes, justifying every proposed term and making sure that each learnable parameter addresses a psychologically distinct process.
   - The minimum number of learnable parameters neededâ€”**have a slight bias towards parsimony**, but if adding a parameter clearly improves interpretability, accuracy, or fit, justify and include it.

2. **Model Structure**: 
   - You are encouraged to consider not only simple linear additive terms but also **nonlinear, thresholded, or interaction terms** between key variables, as long as their inclusion is justifiable and their parameter values are likely to be statistically identifiable (i.e., not highly covariant with existing parameters).
   - Explicitly discuss whether absolute self-interest (magnitude of own offer) should be separated from fairness/unfairness, and consider whether gain framing or loss framing makes sense.
   - Ensure that every parameter uniquely maps to a hypothesized cognitive or motivational process.

3. **Parameter Covariance and Recovery**:
   - Proactively seek to avoid high covariance or redundancy between learnable parameters. Where two variables could overlap, discuss and choose the mathematically or conceptually clearest approach.
   - Consider parameter rescaling (e.g., using percent deviation vs. absolute income) to make parameters as orthogonal and recoverable as possible.

4. **Variable Mapping**:
   - Clearly define all variables, giving careful attention to how each calculated or derived variable relates to raw data and psychological process.
   - For *every* learnable parameter, provide a generous but finite range for estimation.

5. **Encourage out-of-the-box thinking**:
   - At least one candidate model should include an interaction, threshold, or nonlinear (e.g., tanh, sigmoid, step, or quadratic) term in addition to or instead of simple linear effects, provided this supports psychological interpretability.
   - If you reject such a term, provide a brief rationale for its exclusion.

**Deliverable**:  
Proceed step by step, reasoning through these points as you build your model. Your model will be evaluated both for predictive performance and the dissociability of its parameters, so strive for both parsimony and innovation.

Be meticulous and explicit at every stage, and do not simply default to the standard linear model. Show that you have considered and explored at least one *novel* or *creative* modeling possibility before selecting your final form.
