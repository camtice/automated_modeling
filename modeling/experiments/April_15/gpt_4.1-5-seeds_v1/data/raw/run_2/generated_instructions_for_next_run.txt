**Instructions for Computational Modeling Design (Run 3 of 5):**

The objective is to create a computational model of responder behavior in the provided resource division dataset that achieves the best balance of fit (minimize BIC), predictive accuracy, and most importantly, highly dissociable and recoverable learnable parameters for every psychological factor included.

Please complete all steps below, being explicit and deliberate at each stage. Do NOT simply default to linear or all-purpose nonlinear forms. Strive for thoughtful innovation, paired with critical evaluation of parameter identifiability and recoverability.

1. **Stepwise Model Construction:**
   - Clearly articulate the main psychological mechanisms in play (e.g., self-interest, fairness, disadvantage aversion, thresholds).
   - For each mechanism, discuss likely nonlinearities, thresholds, or interaction effects. For example: does fairness aversion increase only when the responder receives less than the opponent? Does self-interest interact with perceived unfairness?
   - For each candidate model term or parameter, briefly justify its psychological distinctness and whether it is likely to be statistically dissociable from other terms given the data structure.
   - Have a bias toward *parsimony*: include only as many learnable parameters as are necessary for clear mapping to distinct psychological processes, unless otherwise justified.
   - Reject additive or nonlinear/interactive terms that cannot be dissociated in recovery, and explicitly state why.

2. **Model Structure & Parameter Justification:**
   - Consider both linear and **at least one** out-of-the-box nonlinear or interaction term (e.g., a variable that activates only when a key threshold is crossed, a product of two variables, or an indicator function).
   - If you reject a nonlinear or interactive form, provide a clear rationale grounded in identifiability or psychological theory.
   - For every learnable parameter, specify its plausible range and prior (with finite, clearly stated bounds); no unbounded parameter estimates are allowed (except the utility variable itself).
   - Explicitly discuss and address possible parameter covariance or redundancy—describe how each parameter will remain recoverable and distinct.

3. **Parameter Recovery and Identifiability Focus:**
   - Before finalizing your formula, provide a short reflection: what would make each parameter recoverable and what might threaten identifiability (e.g., high collinearity, overlapping predictor effects)?
   - If necessary, consider rescaling variables, using percentiles, or introducing indicator/categorical splits (e.g., an “indicator_disadvantage” term) to improve orthogonality and parameter recovery.
   - Avoid "pile-on" of complex or multiple nonlinear terms unless strongly justified by the dataset and required for fit/interpretability.

4. **Variable Specification:**
   - Provide a complete, clear mapping from each variable in the model to the dataset structure.
   - All calculated variables and all learnable parameters must be included and carefully defined.
   - Use clear and unambiguous naming for each parameter and variable—avoid any confusion or reserved words.

5. **Deliverable Format:**
   - Proceed through the reasoning and justification first, including a concise rationale for each modeling decision (including why any plausible variants were omitted).
   - Then present:
     - The mathematical model, strictly between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags (math only, no extra words).
     - The variable and parameter definitions in <VARIABLES>…</VARIABLES> tags (use the provided JSON format).
     - The name of the predicted variable (with <target_variable>accept</target_variable>).
     - A clear, one-paragraph summary in <SUMMARY>…</SUMMARY> tags.

Aim for the **optimal balance** of predictive fit, psychological interpretability, and parameter recovery. Your model will be evaluated on all three criteria, so justify every addition—and omission—explicitly. Remember, including complex nonlinear or interaction terms is encouraged, but only where they substantially improve interpretability or predictive performance **and** support robust recovery of all parameters.

Think carefully and innovatively, check parameter identifiability, and provide defensible, precise model specifications in the designated format.
