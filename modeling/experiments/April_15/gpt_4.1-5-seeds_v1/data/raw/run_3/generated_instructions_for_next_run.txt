**Instructions for Computational Modeling Design (Run 4 of 5):**

Your objective is to develop an improved computational model of responder behavior in the provided resource division dataset, achieving the *optimal balance* of model fit (minimize BIC), predictive accuracy, and, above all, robust, dissociable (highly recoverable) parameters for every psychological process explicitly included. 

**Rigorous focus on parameter recovery and dissociability is mandatory.** Prior results have shown that even plausible nonlinear or fairness penalty terms may not yield recoverable parameters when they overlap conceptually or statistically. Your model will be directly evaluated for each learnable parameter’s recovery, and solutions with unrecoverable parameters will be rejected—even if overall fit appears competitive.

Please explicitly follow the steps below, carefully justifying all decisions:

---

1. **Psychological Mechanism Articulation & Variable Construction**
   - List key psychological determinants: e.g., self-interest, fairness/unfairness, disadvantage aversion, acceptance bias.
   - For each, consider the cleanest, least-collinear way to represent it using variables from the dataset.
   - Articulate the difference between flawed (collinear, redundant, or overly broad/“fuzzy”) variable constructions and *orthogonal*, indicator-based, or contrast-coded predictors.
   - For all fairness-related terms, explicitly consider using the difference between the proposed and deserved share (deserved_share = (token_self / [token_self + token_opp])); specify whether to use the raw difference, percent, or an indicator.
   - Explore indicator (“is_disadvantage”) or threshold (e.g., unfairness only counts if negative for responder) variables to separate mechanisms and improve identifiability.
   - Consider variable centering or normalization for predictors—explain tradeoffs.

2. **Parsimony, Parameter Mapping and Explicit Nonlinearity Use**
   - Include only as many learnable parameters as necessary for a one-to-one mapping to distinct motivational or cognitive processes, unless a justified exception applies.
   - Include nonlinearity or interaction/threshold terms ONLY where they do not risk parameter recovery (e.g., avoid using both fairness deviation and self-interest, unless their recoverability can be justified by orthogonality).
   - If you include any nonlinear or threshold/interaction term, pause to explicitly simulate mentally how it will affect parameter separability, and retain only if aids recovery and fit.
   - You must propose at least one alternative modeling approach (e.g., indicator-based vs. ramp function; fairness-as-difference versus fairness deviation), explicitly compare their likely parameter recovery, and justify your final choice.
   - If you reject a candidate mechanism/term on identifiability grounds, state this clearly.

3. **Parameter Recovery & Orthogonality Reflection**
   - Before committing to a final formula, briefly analyze (in writing) potential sources of parameter non-recovery (e.g., overlapping predictors, insufficient variation, cross-mapping).
   - Suggest (and, if appropriate, implement) variable rescaling, centering, or splitting (e.g., indicator variables) to increase orthogonality and parameter independence.
   - Prioritize exact coding for psychologically discrete mechanisms (e.g., disadvantage = 1 only when offered < opponent).
   - Use as few, as mutually non-redundant, parameters as possible.

4. **Formal Specifications**
   - Provide an explicit, formulaic, *mathematical model* strictly between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags. Your model must use only variables present or calculable from the provided dataset.
   - Include all variable and parameter definitions in the specified JSON format.
   - Specify the *target variable* as per the provided structure.
   - Succinctly summarize the model’s structure, psychological motivation, and parameter mappings in <SUMMARY> tags.

**Deliverables Format:**
- Thorough, stepwise reasoning and justification (as outlined above).
- <MODEL>…</MODEL> (math only—no explainer text).
- <VARIABLES>…</VARIABLES> in correct JSON format.
- <target_variable>…</target_variable>
- <SUMMARY>…</SUMMARY>

**Special Encouragement:**  
- Challenge yourself to consider out-of-the-box yet recoverable constructs (e.g., indicator functions, difference scores, threshold-triggered penalties, etc.), not just default linear/ramp approaches.
- Explicitly state why each included or excluded feature supports both psychological interpretability and parameter identifiability.
- *Prioritize parameter recovery and orthogonal encoding* over formulaic complexity.

Think deliberately about variable construction and parameter separability, justify every decision, and provide clear, reproducible model specifications.
