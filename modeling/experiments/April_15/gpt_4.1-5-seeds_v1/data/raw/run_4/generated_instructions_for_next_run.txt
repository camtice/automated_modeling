**Instructions for Computational Modeling Design (Run 5 of 5):**

Your goal is to develop a computational model of responder behavior in the resource-sharing negotiation dataset that *maximizes parameter recovery and interpretability*, while also achieving strong model fit (minimized BIC) and predictive accuracy. 

**Above all, every included learnable parameter must show robust, orthogonal recovery (i.e., each can be individually and reliably recovered regardless of the others).** 

Prior modeling attempts illustrate that plausible psychological mechanisms—if encoded with overlapping or collinear variables—fail recovery tests and thus undermine interpretability and model utility. Therefore, **do not include any parameter whose recovery you cannot justify, and lean toward variable constructions that maximize strict dissociation.**

Proceed step by step, following this process:

---

1. **Map Psychological Processes to Strict, Orthogonal Variable Encodings**
   - List all plausible psychological mechanisms that could drive responder behavior (e.g., self-interest, proportional fairness, disadvantage aversion, acceptance bias, advantageous inequity aversion, threshold effects).
   - For each, propose at least two distinct variable encodings using only provided dataset fields—for example:
     - As a continuous variable (e.g., difference in share vs. fairness).
     - As an indicator or threshold-triggered variable (e.g., is the participant disadvantaged?).
     - As a normalized/percent variable or a centered (zero-mean) score.
   - For each encoding, reflect on collinearity and statistical redundancy. Identify which combinations are mathematically or conceptually non-overlapping (e.g., mutually exclusive indicators, or strictly contrast-coded predictors).
   - **Explicitly reject candidate variables/encodings that risk parameter dependence or redundancy.** If two variables cannot be orthogonal, choose only one or recode to enforce exclusivity.

2. **Design for Maximal Recovery and Interpretability**
   - Only include a learnable parameter if there is a strictly dissociable, one-to-one mapping from parameter to psychological process and to observable model variance.
   - For fairness, consider using percent deviation from deserved share, ramp or indicator functions, or stepwise effects. 
   - For disadvantage, strongly prefer indicator or exclusivity-based codings (e.g., “is_offer_disadvantage” = 1 if responder is offered less than the opponent) over broad linear terms.
   - Wherever possible, encode model inputs so that only one parameter “acts” on each trial (except for the bias/intercept). This empirically supports robust recovery.
   - Before finalizing your formula, **perform a "mental simulation"**: for each parameter, specify which trial types it impacts, and check that its effect cannot be numerically mimicked by any combination of other parameters.
   - If using a nonlinear, threshold, or step function, justify mathematically why it will not undermine recovery—otherwise, do not include it.

3. **Compare Alternative Approaches Before Committing**
   - For at least one psychological mechanism, propose and analyze *two* possible model encodings, assessing the likely impact on collinearity and recovery.
   - Choose the alternative that most cleanly isolates the intended process.
   - Explicitly discuss why you rejected the non-selected alternative(s).

4. **Model Parsimony & Justification**
   - Do not include unnecessary or overlapping parameters. A lean model with fully recoverable parameters is vastly preferable to a maximally-complex but non-interpretable one.

5. **Formal Specification and Structured Output**
   - Write the model as a strict mathematical formula between <MODEL>... </MODEL> tags (math only; no comments or explanation).
   - Provide variable definitions, ranges, parameter bounds, and learnability in the required JSON format between <VARIABLES> tags.
   - Specify the target variable within <target_variable> tags.
   - In <SUMMARY> tags, succinctly describe the psychological processes modeled, the orthogonal mappings to parameters, and any indicator or contrast coding strategies used.

**Special Emphasis for This Final Run:**
- *Creativity is required!* Consider variable splits (e.g., percent unfairness vs. disadvantage indicator), transformation to step or trigger functions, or combinations with maximum mutual exclusivity.
- If in doubt, select the version that most cleanly partitions psychological processes in a way that a parameter recovery assessment could verify.
- *Do not reuse any conventional “ramp” or “split deviation” forms shown to have poor recovery unless you have mathematically restructured them for strict orthogonality.*
- If your mental simulation suggests any potential for parameter trade-off or cross-talk, revise the encoding until complete parameter independence is achieved.

Be concise but rigorous in your reasoning and justifications. Only submit models with parameterizations you genuinely expect will yield *all* parameters highly recoverable, while remaining interpretable and predictive.
