The previous model (linear sensitivity to share – deserved, with bias) achieved solid parameter recovery, BIC, and accuracy—but there is room for improvement. While parameter covariance was kept low with two parameters, the model might lack nuance in accounting for nonlinearity, reference dependence, or idiosyncratic aversion to disadvantageous allocations.

To improve, instructions could challenge the modeler to consider:
- Nonlinear transformations of fairness/inequity (e.g., loss aversion, diminishing sensitivity)
- Incorporation of both advantageous and disadvantageous inequity aversion (e.g., different weights)
- Using reference-point–based approaches (“deserved” may act as a reference; consider deviations both ways)
- Allowing for a “kinked” sensitivity (e.g., responding differently above/below fairness)
- Exploring prospect theory, threshold, or piecewise utility functions
- Consider including an explicit lapse/noise parameter, but only if justified
- Encouraging creative functional forms (step, quadratic, absolute difference)
- Still urge parsimony and parameter recoverability, discouraging overparameterization

Explicitly guide the user to reason about:
- Psychological theories supporting different fairness attitudes (e.g., aversion to getting less vs. more than deserved)
- Whether there are sharp accept/reject boundaries
- If subjective value is linear in fairness, or subject to diminishing/magnified effects near “fair”
- The implications of using absolute values, nonlinearities, or piecewise models on interpretability & recoverability

Summon the modeler to justify every model and parameter via psychological or behavioral ground, not just statistics. Invite out-of-the-box or hybrid approaches—provided all is grounded in interpretability and practical parameter recovery.

For this run, follow these updated instructions:

Carefully consider and explicitly justify your model structure based on both psychological theory and the need for robust, identifiable parameters. In your reasoning, address:

- The core psychological drivers of responder choices in this scenario (including, but not limited to, fairness considerations, self-interest, and potential asymmetry in reactions to receiving less/more than deserved).
- Whether responders show different sensitivities to disadvantageous (receiving less than “deserved”) versus advantageous (receiving more) inequity, and how to model this mathematically (e.g., as different parameters or a nonlinear, "kinked" function).
- If subjective value for fairness (or unfairness) might be best represented as a linear, nonlinear (e.g., squared, absolute difference), or piecewise function.
- How the chosen form affects parameter recovery and covariance, and how many parameters are truly justifiable (with a strong bias toward interpretability and recoverability).
- Whether a baseline bias/threshold or additional lapse/noise parameter should be included and why (explicitly justify any additional parameter on psychological/empirical grounds).
- The mapping from model variables and parameters to observable behavior, ensuring that every parameter serves a meaningful psychological or behavioral function.

Challenge yourself to consider alternative functional forms (nonlinear, asymmetric, or threshold-based models) as well as hybrid or less-conventional approaches—so long as all elements are interpretable and facilitate strong parameter recovery.

Provide clear reasoning leading to your proposed mathematical model, then supply the specified model structure and variable descriptors as before. Be rigorous in ensuring all model elements are both psychologically meaningful and statistically identifiable. Prioritize models that are both accurate and parsimonious, and provide explicit justification for the inclusion of each learnable parameter.
