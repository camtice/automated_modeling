      "output": "Let me reason step by step:\n\n## Step 1: Key Psychological Mechanisms\n\nAs the proposer in the ultimatum game, several mechanisms are likely in play:\n\n1. **Self-interest**: Proposers want to maximize their own payoff.\n2. **Fairness/Equity/Norm sensitivity**: Proposers take into account what is \"fair,\" which here may be proportional to relative contributions (`token_self` vs. `token_opp`).\n3. **Anticipation of Rejection**: Proposers may shade their offer to avoid rejections, but since we're predicting actual proposals (not modeling the responder and rejection), we don't need to explicitly model the responder's acceptance probability unless we think proposers learn/expect it.\n4. **Noise/Idiosyncraticity**: People's choices have some randomness or unexplained variance.\n\nCritically, in this paradigm, \"fair\" is not simply 50/50\u2014it's proportional to tokens found (equity norm).\n\n## Step 2: Mechanism Interactions and Data Structure\n\n- For each proposer trial (trial_role==2), participant proposes a percentage (`proposed_perc`) of the joint pot that goes to the other player.\n- \"Fair\" (equitable) split is: each person's contribution as a share of total tokens (`token_self`/(token_self + token_opp)), but the proposal is for the **opponent's share** (i.e., what % of pot the other person gets).\n    - Thus, what is \"fair\" for the *opponent* (the share of the combined earning corresponding to their token ratio): fair_perc_opp = (`token_opp` / (`token_opp` + `token_self`)) * 100\n- The settings for combined_earning and proportions of tokens both vary.\n\n## Step 3: Mathematical Form\n\n### Option 1: Basic Equity Deviation Model\n\nA classic and interpretable model is:\n\nproposed_perc = \u03b1 + \u03b2 * fair_perc_opp + \u03b5\n\nWhere:\n- \u03b1 captures a global generosity or self-interest bias\n- \u03b2 is sensitivity to the fairness norm\n- \u03b5 is Gaussian noise\n\nBUT: In practice, \u03b2 and \u03b1 will be highly covarying (both can push the proposals up and down), so we may wish to constrain one or simply absorb both in a single parameter. To prevent high covariance, a **single weighting** of fairness may suffice.\n\n### Option 2: Weighted Combination Model (one free parameter)\n\nproposed_perc = (1 - fairness_weight) * min_share + fairness_weight * fair_perc_opp + \u03b5\n\n- min_share is the minimum possible non-zero proposal (psychologically a kind of \"ultimatum game minimum\") or just 0.\n- fairness_weight \u2208 [0,1]\n\nBut if we use just a linear interpolation between fair and self-interested (min proposal), with one parameter fairness_weight, this reduces collinearity and maximizes parameter recovery.\n\nFurther, for simplicity and realism, we can say:\n\nproposed_perc = fairness_weight * fair_perc_opp + (1 - fairness_weight) * min_prop_opp + noise\n\nWhere:\n- min_prop_opp is the minimal possible share that the proposer can credibly offer (could set = 0, but to be more data-driven let's make it a small constant or a learnable parameter, but best to fix to 0 for identifiability).\n\nAlternatively, participants may just anchor their proposals directly to fair_perc_opp, modulated by a slope + bias (i.e., linear regression), but we want to reduce unnecessary free parameters.\n\n#### Given the priority for parameter recovery and against overfitting, **a model with one fairness weighting parameter and a fixed intercept is optimal**.\n\n### Option 3: Power Transformation Model (moderate complexity, still with only one parameter):\n\nproposed_perc = fair_perc_opp ^ fairness_exponent\n\nBut this is less interpretable and may be less psychologically plausible than a linear combination.\n\n#### To allow some idiosyncratic bias, we can add a single additive bias (intercept), but keep this in a finite range (e.g., -20 to 20).\n\n### Option 4: Final Hybrid Model\n\nproposed_perc = bias + fairness_weight * fair_perc_opp\n\nWith finite bounds:\n\n- bias \u2208 [-20, 20]\n- fairness_weight \u2208 [0, 2]\n\nThis has only two free parameters. If fairness_weight == 1 and bias == 0: the proposal matches the proportional fairness norm. If fairness_weight < 1, proposer is less fair; if fairness_weight > 1, proposer is more than fair. bias allows a global generosity/self-interest shift.\n\n**Assume Gaussian noise for describing prediction error (not for model structure).**\n\n## Step 4: Mapping to Dataset\n\n- Only applies for trial_role == 2 (proposer)\n- target_variable: proposed_perc\n\n## Step 5: Listing Used Variables\n\n- token_opp, token_self \u2192 used to compute fair_perc_opp\n- bias, fairness_weight: learnable\n- proposed_perc: observed, and predicted.\n\nOptionally, for completeness we could use min/max bounds on fairness_weight and bias, as above.\n\n## Step 6: Model Output\n\n### Mathematical Formula (for each proposer trial):\n\nLet:\n\nfair_perc_opp = 100 * token_opp / (token_opp + token_self)\n\nPrediction:\n\nproposed_perc_pred = bias + fairness_weight * fair_perc_opp\n\n(If desired, could bound predictions to [0,100] at model prediction time.)\n\n---\n\n## Model Specification\n\nNow, as per instruction, here is the answer:\n\n<MODEL>\nfair_perc_opp = 100 * token_opp / (token_opp + token_self)\nproposed_perc_pred = bias + fairness_weight * fair_perc_opp\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"bias\": {\n      \"description\": \"Additive bias in proposer behavior; positive means more generous, negative less generous in percentage points.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -20,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"fairness_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight on the fairness norm: 1 means participants offer the fair share, <1 means less than fair, >1 means more than fair.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"fair_perc_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Percentage share of combined tokens earned by opponent (i.e., fairness norm percentage for opponent).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"proposed_perc_pred\": {\n      \"description\": \"Predicted percentage of combined earning offered by participant (as proposer) to opponent.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -20,\n        \"max\": 220,\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>proposed_perc</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA linear fairness-weighted model predicts proposer generosity as a function of the fairness norm (opponent's proportional contribution), with a single additive bias term.

  "full_reasoning": "Let me reason step by step:\n\n## Step 1: Key Psychological Mechanisms\n\nAs the proposer in the ultimatum game, several mechanisms are likely in play:\n\n1. **Self-interest**: Proposers want to maximize their own payoff.\n2. **Fairness/Equity/Norm sensitivity**: Proposers take into account what is \"fair,\" which here may be proportional to relative contributions (`token_self` vs. `token_opp`).\n3. **Anticipation of Rejection**: Proposers may shade their offer to avoid rejections, but since we're predicting actual proposals (not modeling the responder and rejection), we don't need to explicitly model the responder's acceptance probability unless we think proposers learn/expect it.\n4. **Noise/Idiosyncraticity**: People's choices have some randomness or unexplained variance.\n\nCritically, in this paradigm, \"fair\" is not simply 50/50\u2014it's proportional to tokens found (equity norm).\n\n## Step 2: Mechanism Interactions and Data Structure\n\n- For each proposer trial (trial_role==2), participant proposes a percentage (`proposed_perc`) of the joint pot that goes to the other player.\n- \"Fair\" (equitable) split is: each person's contribution as a share of total tokens (`token_self`/(token_self + token_opp)), but the proposal is for the **opponent's share** (i.e., what % of pot the other person gets).\n    - Thus, what is \"fair\" for the *opponent* (the share of the combined earning corresponding to their token ratio): fair_perc_opp = (`token_opp` / (`token_opp` + `token_self`)) * 100\n- The settings for combined_earning and proportions of tokens both vary.\n\n## Step 3: Mathematical Form\n\n### Option 1: Basic Equity Deviation Model\n\nA classic and interpretable model is:\n\nproposed_perc = \u03b1 + \u03b2 * fair_perc_opp + \u03b5\n\nWhere:\n- \u03b1 captures a global generosity or self-interest bias\n- \u03b2 is sensitivity to the fairness norm\n- \u03b5 is Gaussian noise\n\nBUT: In practice, \u03b2 and \u03b1 will be highly covarying (both can push the proposals up and down), so we may wish to constrain one or simply absorb both in a single parameter. To prevent high covariance, a **single weighting** of fairness may suffice.\n\n### Option 2: Weighted Combination Model (one free parameter)\n\nproposed_perc = (1 - fairness_weight) * min_share + fairness_weight * fair_perc_opp + \u03b5\n\n- min_share is the minimum possible non-zero proposal (psychologically a kind of \"ultimatum game minimum\") or just 0.\n- fairness_weight \u2208 [0,1]\n\nBut if we use just a linear interpolation between fair and self-interested (min proposal), with one parameter fairness_weight, this reduces collinearity and maximizes parameter recovery.\n\nFurther, for simplicity and realism, we can say:\n\nproposed_perc = fairness_weight * fair_perc_opp + (1 - fairness_weight) * min_prop_opp + noise\n\nWhere:\n- min_prop_opp is the minimal possible share that the proposer can credibly offer (could set = 0, but to be more data-driven let's make it a small constant or a learnable parameter, but best to fix to 0 for identifiability).\n\nAlternatively, participants may just anchor their proposals directly to fair_perc_opp, modulated by a slope + bias (i.e., linear regression), but we want to reduce unnecessary free parameters.\n\n#### Given the priority for parameter recovery and against overfitting, **a model with one fairness weighting parameter and a fixed intercept is optimal**.\n\n### Option 3: Power Transformation Model (moderate complexity, still with only one parameter):\n\nproposed_perc = fair_perc_opp ^ fairness_exponent\n\nBut this is less interpretable and may be less psychologically plausible than a linear combination.\n\n#### To allow some idiosyncratic bias, we can add a single additive bias (intercept), but keep this in a finite range (e.g., -20 to 20).\n\n### Option 4: Final Hybrid Model\n\nproposed_perc = bias + fairness_weight * fair_perc_opp\n\nWith finite bounds:\n\n- bias \u2208 [-20, 20]\n- fairness_weight \u2208 [0, 2]\n\nThis has only two free parameters. If fairness_weight == 1 and bias == 0: the proposal matches the proportional fairness norm. If fairness_weight < 1, proposer is less fair; if fairness_weight > 1, proposer is more than fair. bias allows a global generosity/self-interest shift.\n\n**Assume Gaussian noise for describing prediction error (not for model structure).**\n\n## Step 4: Mapping to Dataset\n\n- Only applies for trial_role == 2 (proposer)\n- target_variable: proposed_perc\n\n## Step 5: Listing Used Variables\n\n- token_opp, token_self \u2192 used to compute fair_perc_opp\n- bias, fairness_weight: learnable\n- proposed_perc: observed, and predicted.\n\nOptionally, for completeness we could use min/max bounds on fairness_weight and bias, as above.\n\n## Step 6: Model Output\n\n### Mathematical Formula (for each proposer trial):\n\nLet:\n\nfair_perc_opp = 100 * token_opp / (token_opp + token_self)\n\nPrediction:\n\nproposed_perc_pred = bias + fairness_weight * fair_perc_opp\n\n(If desired, could bound predictions to [0,100] at model prediction time.)\n\n---\n\n## Model Specification\n\nNow, as per instruction, here is the answer:\n\n<MODEL>\nfair_perc_opp = 100 * token_opp / (token_opp + token_self)\nproposed_perc_pred = bias + fairness_weight * fair_perc_opp\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"bias\": {\n      \"description\": \"Additive bias in proposer behavior; positive means more generous, negative less generous in percentage points.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -20,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"fairness_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight on the fairness norm: 1 means participants offer the fair share, <1 means less than fair, >1 means more than fair.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"fair_perc_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Percentage share of combined tokens earned by opponent (i.e., fairness norm percentage for opponent).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"proposed_perc_pred\": {\n      \"description\": \"Predicted percentage of combined earning offered by participant (as proposer) to opponent.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -20,\n        \"max\": 220,\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>proposed_perc</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA linear fairness-weighted model predicts proposer generosity as a function of the fairness norm (opponent's proportional contribution), with a single additive bias term.

The model has two learnable parameters: a fairness weight indicating adherence to proportional fairness, and an intercept reflecting global generosity or self-interest. Predictions are made only on proposer trials and directly regressed against the observed proposed percentage. The model is highly identifiable and optimized for strong parameter recovery.\nTarget Variable: proposed_perc\nPrediction Type: numerical_variable_estimation\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- bias: r = 1.000\n- fairness_weight: r = 1.000"
