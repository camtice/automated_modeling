This captures fairness sensitivity and idiosyncratic generosity or selfishness using only two key learnable parameters (plus noise), optimizing parameter identifiability from limited data while leveraging all relevant task variables.",v1,"Be VERY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters as the model. Have an appropriate number or learnable parameters, with a slight bias for less learnable paramters.

First, reason step by step about:
* The key psychological mechanisms involved
* How these mechanisms interact
* What mathematical form could capture these interactions
* What parameters would be needed to calibrate the model
* How the model variables map to observable behavior",0.21533840721486108,0.07177409196881872,-0.05161757205824752
