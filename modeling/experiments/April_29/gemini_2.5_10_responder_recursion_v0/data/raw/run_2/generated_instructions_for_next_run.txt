Okay, here are the updated instructions for the next run:

<instructions>
The previous modeling attempt successfully used an adapted Fehr-Schmidt utility framework with absolute monetary amounts (`split_self`, `deserved_split`) rather than percentages. This approach yielded significant improvements, resulting in a model with good BIC (~38.6), high accuracy (~0.81), and strong parameter recovery (all correlations > 0.75).

Your goal for this run is to **build upon this success** or propose a well-justified alternative model to **further refine performance**. Aim to:

1.  **Decrease BIC** below the current best of ~38.6.
2.  **Increase Accuracy** above the current best of ~0.81.
3.  **Maintain Excellent Parameter Recovery** (target correlations > 0.7 or ideally > 0.8 for all learnable parameters).

Consider these avenues for improvement:

1.  **Refine the Fehr-Schmidt Structure:**
    *   **Advantageous Inequity:** The previous successful model only included disadvantageous inequity (`alpha_ineq`). Explore adding a term for advantageous inequity (`beta_adv_ineq * max(0, split_self - deserved_split)`), consistent with the full Fehr-Schmidt model. Does getting *more* than the deserved share decrease utility (due to guilt or general inequity aversion)? Adding this parameter (`beta_adv_ineq`) might capture additional variance but ensure it remains identifiable.
    *   **Non-Linear Sensitivity:** Does utility scale linearly with the monetary gain (`split_self`) or the magnitude of inequity (`inequity`)? Consider introducing simple non-linearities, for example, using power parameters (`sens * split_self ^ gamma_gain`, `alpha_ineq * inequity ^ delta_loss`). Justify why such non-linearity might be psychologically plausible (e.g., diminishing sensitivity to gains, increasing sensitivity to losses). Be mindful that added parameters can make recovery harder.

2.  **Explore Alternative Conceptualizations:**
    *   **Ratio-Based Fairness:** Instead of the *difference* (`deserved_split - split_self`), could fairness perception be better captured by a *ratio*, such as `split_self / deserved_split`? How would you incorporate this into the utility function? Consider how to handle cases where `deserved_split` is zero or very small. For example, `Utility = bias + sens * log(split_self + epsilon) - alpha_ineq * log(deserved_split + epsilon)` or `Utility = bias + sens * split_self * (split_self / (deserved_split + epsilon))^gamma`?
    *   **Reference Dependence (Prospect Theory):** Explicitly model `deserved_split` as a reference point. Define a value function `v(x)` where `x = split_self - deserved_split`. This function could exhibit loss aversion (steeper slope for `x < 0`) and potentially diminishing sensitivity. For instance: `value = x` if `x >= 0`, else `value = loss_aversion * x` (where `loss_aversion > 1`). Then `Utility = bias + value`. Or use power functions for gains and losses separately relative to the reference.

3.  **Focus on Identifiability and Parsimony:** While exploring added complexity, ensure that new parameters capture distinct psychological constructs and are likely to be statistically identifiable. Prioritize models where the parameters have clear interpretations and minimal overlap in their functional roles. Aim for 3-5 well-motivated parameters. A simpler model that maintains high performance is preferable to a complex one if the gains are marginal or recovery suffers.

Please provide your reasoning step-by-step, explaining how your proposed model builds on previous findings or offers a distinct, promising alternative, and how it aims to improve BIC/Accuracy while ensuring strong parameter recovery. Then, provide the model specification following the required format (<MODEL>, <VARIABLES>, <target_variable>, <SUMMARY>).
