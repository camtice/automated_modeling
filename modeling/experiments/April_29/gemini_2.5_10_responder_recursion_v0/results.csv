The model uses three learnable parameters: `bias`, `sensitivity_prop`, and `alpha_ineq_prop`.",v0,"Okay, here are the updated instructions for the next run (Run 7):



<instructions>
The previous run (Run 6) tested a model incorporating diminishing marginal utility of gain via a logarithmic transformation: `Utility = bias + sensitivity * log(split_self + 1) - alpha_ineq * inequity`. While maintaining reasonably good BIC (~34.2) and accuracy (~0.817), this model unfortunately failed to achieve acceptable parameter recovery, with both `sensitivity` (r~0.67) and `alpha_ineq` (r~0.67) falling below the target threshold (r > 0.75).

This follows a pattern where introducing non-linearity (log-inequity in Run 5, log-gain in Run 6) improved fit compared to a simple linear model (Run 1) but compromised parameter recovery. This suggests that the standard ways of incorporating non-linearity might be creating identifiability issues between the gain and inequity sensitivity parameters, possibly due to inherent correlations when using absolute monetary values.

**Your Goal:** Develop a model that achieves **excellent parameter recovery (all r > 0.75)** while also reaching **good model fit (Target BIC < 34, Accuracy > 0.82)**. We need to break the trade-off observed between fit and recovery.

**New Direction: Normalization / Proportional Values**

Instead of focusing solely on different non-linear functions, let's explore a structural change: **normalization**. The hypothesis is that agents might evaluate offers not just based on absolute monetary amounts, but based on proportions relative to the total available amount (`combined_earning`). Using proportional gain and proportional inequity might decouple the parameters and improve identifiability.

**Proposed Model Structure (Primary Focus):**

Test a simple linear utility model, structurally similar to the first successful model (Run 1), but operating on *proportions* instead of absolute values:

1.  Calculate the participant's deserved share as a proportion:
    *   `total_tokens = token_self + token_opp`
    *   `contribution_ratio = (token_self / total_tokens) if total_tokens > 0 else 0.5`
    *   `deserved_perc = contribution_ratio`
2.  Calculate the participant's received share as a proportion:
    *   `split_perc = (split_self / combined_earning) if combined_earning > 0 else 0`
3.  Calculate the disadvantageous inequity in proportional terms:
    *   `inequity_perc = max(0, deserved_perc - split_perc)`
4.  Calculate Utility linearly based on these proportions:
    *   `Utility = bias + sensitivity_prop * split_perc - alpha_ineq_prop * inequity_perc`

This model uses 3 learnable parameters:
*   `bias`: Baseline acceptance tendency.
*   `sensitivity_prop`: Sensitivity to the *proportion* of the total earnings offered.
*   `alpha_ineq_prop`: Sensitivity (aversion) to the *proportional* difference between the deserved share and the received share.

**Emphasis:**
*   Implement the **proportional value model** described above.
*   This approach aims to directly address the parameter recovery issues seen in Runs 5 and 6 by changing the scale/nature of the inputs (proportions vs. absolute values) while using a linear form that previously showed good recovery.
*   Ensure your model uses exactly 3 learnable parameters (`bias`, `sensitivity_prop`, `alpha_ineq_prop`).
*   Define appropriate, generous but finite numerical bounds for these parameters. Consider that sensitivity to proportions (0-1 range) might require different scaling than sensitivity to absolute amounts (£0-£X).
*   Think creatively about alternative model structures if you strongly believe this normalization approach won't work, but prioritize testing this proportional model first, justifying any deviations clearly.

The model has three learnable parameters: bias, sensitivity_prop (for offered proportion), and alpha_log_ineq_prop (for log-proportional-inequity aversion).",v0,"Okay, here are the updated instructions for the next run (Run 9):

<instructions>
The previous run tested a linear model using proportional values (`Utility = bias + sensitivity_prop * split_perc - alpha_ineq_prop * inequity_perc`). This achieved the best BIC score so far (31.01) and excellent recovery for the `bias` parameter (r=0.91). However, it failed to meet the goals for accuracy (0.789 vs target >0.82) and, critically, resulted in poor parameter recovery for both `sensitivity_prop` (r=0.515) and `alpha_ineq_prop` (r=0.492), both well below the target of r > 0.75.

This suggests that simply using proportions in a linear model, while improving overall fit (BIC), did not resolve the identifiability issue between the gain and inequity sensitivity parameters. There might still be significant correlation between the proportional gain (`split_perc`) and proportional inequity (`inequity_perc`) terms, or the linear relationship might be insufficient to capture the decision process accurately.

**Your Goal:** Develop a model that leverages the improved fit potential of proportional values (aiming for **BIC < 31**) while significantly improving **parameter recovery (all r > 0.75)** and achieving **good accuracy (Accuracy > 0.82)**.

**New Direction: Non-Linearity on Proportional Inequity**

Since the proportional representation yielded good BIC, let's retain that but re-introduce non-linearity. Specifically, let's apply a transformation to the proportional inequity term, mirroring a previous model (Run 5, which used log-inequity on absolute values and showed better sensitivity recovery). This might capture diminishing sensitivity to proportional unfairness and help decorrelate the inequity term from the proportional gain term.

**Proposed Model Structure (Primary Focus):**

Test a utility model using proportional gain and a logarithmically transformed proportional inequity term:

1.  Calculate intermediate proportional terms as before:
    *   `total_tokens = token_self + token_opp`
    *   `contribution_ratio = (token_self / total_tokens) if total_tokens > 0 else 0.5`
    *   `deserved_perc = contribution_ratio`
    *   `split_perc = (split_self / combined_earning) if combined_earning > 0 else 0`
    *   `inequity_perc = max(0, deserved_perc - split_perc)`
2.  Apply logarithmic transformation to the proportional inequity:
    *   Define a small constant `epsilon = 1e-6` (to avoid log(0)).
    *   `log_inequity_perc = log(inequity_perc + epsilon)`
3.  Calculate Utility:
    *   `Utility = bias + sensitivity_prop * split_perc - alpha_log_ineq_prop * log_inequity_perc`

This model uses 3 learnable parameters:
*   `bias`: Baseline acceptance tendency.
*   `sensitivity_prop`: Sensitivity to the *proportion* of the total earnings offered (linear term).
*   `alpha_log_ineq_prop`: Sensitivity (aversion) to the *logarithm* of proportional disadvantageous inequity.

**Emphasis:**
*   Implement the **proportional model with log-transformed inequity** described above. Include the small constant `epsilon` in your model specification and variable descriptions (as a fixed value).
*   This approach aims to combine the good fit of proportions (Run 8 BIC) with the potential recovery benefits of non-linear inequity (inspired by Run 5 results).
*   Ensure your model uses exactly 3 learnable parameters (`bias`, `sensitivity_prop`, `alpha_log_ineq_prop`).
*   Define appropriate, generous but finite numerical bounds for these parameters. Consider the scaling implications of the log transformation on `alpha_log_ineq_prop`.
*   While this is the primary focus, briefly consider alternative ways non-linearity could be incorporated with proportions if you have strong reasons, but justify why the proposed log-inequity model is being prioritized or modified.

It uses three learnable parameters: `bias`, `sensitivity`, and `alpha_log_ineq`.",v0,"Okay, here are the updated instructions for the next run:

<instructions>
The previous run tested a model incorporating non-linear disadvantageous inequity using a power function: `Utility = bias + sensitivity * split_self - alpha_ineq * (inequity ** delta_ineq)`. This 4-parameter model achieved the best BIC score so far (~36.3), slightly improving upon the best 3-parameter model (~38.6). However, accuracy remained similar (~0.813), and critically, parameter recovery significantly worsened. While `bias` (r~0.80) and `sensitivity` (r~0.70) were reasonable, `alpha_ineq` dropped (r~0.69), and the new `delta_ineq` parameter had very poor recovery (r~0.44).

This suggests that while some form of non-linearity or refinement might improve model fit (as indicated by BIC), the power function formulation introduced issues with parameter identifiability, potentially due to trade-offs between `alpha_ineq` and `delta_ineq`.

The best reliable model remains the 3-parameter one:
`total_tokens = token_self + token_opp`
`deserved_split = (combined_earning * token_self / total_tokens) if total_tokens > 0 else 0`
`inequity = max(0, deserved_split - split_self)`
`Utility = bias + sens * split_self - alpha_ineq * inequity`
(BIC ~38.6, Accuracy ~0.814, Recovery: bias=0.87, sens=0.78, alpha_ineq=0.81)

**Your Goal:** Develop a model that significantly improves upon *all* metrics compared to the best 3-parameter model above. Specifically aim for:

1.  **Lower BIC** (Target below 36.3, ideally lower).
2.  **Higher Accuracy** (Target above ~0.814).
3.  **Excellent Parameter Recovery** (All parameter correlations should be > 0.75).

**New Directions to Explore:**

Given the recovery issues with the power function, let's explore alternative functional forms or conceptualizations, focusing on parsimony and clear psychological interpretation. Aim for 3 parameters if possible, or 4 only if strongly justified and high recovery can be maintained.

1.  **Ratio-Based Inequity Perception:** Instead of the absolute *difference* `(deserved_split - split_self)`, perhaps subjects perceive unfairness based on the *ratio* between what was deserved and what was offered.
    *   Consider incorporating a term like `log((deserved_split + epsilon) / (split_self + epsilon))`, where epsilon is a small constant (e.g., 0.01) to handle potential division by zero or instability near zero. Disadvantageous inequity occurs when this log-ratio is positive.
    *   Example structure (3 parameters): `Utility = bias + sensitivity * split_self - alpha_ratio_ineq * max(0, log((deserved_split + 0.01) / (split_self + 0.01)))`.
    *   Justify why a ratio might be psychologically more plausible than an absolute difference.

2.  **Logarithmic Transformation of Inequity Difference:** Revisit the idea of non-linearity in inequity aversion, but use a fixed transformation instead of a learnable exponent. A logarithm captures diminishing sensitivity to larger absolute differences.
    *   Example structure (3 parameters): `Utility = bias + sensitivity * split_self - alpha_log_ineq * log(inequity + 1)`. (Note: `inequity` is still `max(0, deserved_split - split_self)`. Adding 1 avoids log(0)).
    *   This tests non-linearity without adding the potentially problematic `delta_ineq` parameter.

3.  **Non-Linear Utility of Gain:** Perhaps the linearity assumption is weaker for the gain term (`split_self`) rather than the inequity term. Diminishing marginal utility of money is a standard economic concept.
    *   Keep the inequity term linear as in the best 3-parameter model, but transform the gain.
    *   Example structure (3 parameters): `Utility = bias + sensitivity * log(split_self + 1) - alpha_ineq * inequity`.
    *   Alternatively: `Utility = bias + sensitivity * sqrt(split_self) - alpha_ineq * inequity`.
    *   This might allow the linear inequity term to fit better if non-linearity in gain was previously interfering.

4.  **Proportional Fairness Comparison:** Frame fairness not in absolute pounds (£), but in terms of proportions of the total pot compared to proportions of contribution.
    *   Calculate `contribution_share = token_self / total_tokens` (handle division by zero).
    *   Calculate `offer_share = split_self / combined_earning` (handle division by zero).
    *   Define inequity based on the difference between these shares: `proportional_inequity = max(0, contribution_share - offer_share)`.
    *   Example structure (3 parameters): `Utility = bias + sensitivity * split_self - alpha_prop_ineq * proportional_inequity`. (Think carefully about edge cases like `total_tokens = 0` or `combined_earning = 0`. Maybe set shares to 0.5 in those cases?).

**Emphasis:** Focus on models that modify the *functional form* of the relationship between variables, rather than just adding parameters linearly (like the advantageous inequity term previously). Prioritize models that maintain 3 parameters or have a very strong justification for a 4th, coupled with excellent expected parameter recovery. Think outside the standard Fehr-Schmidt variations if inspired, but ensure psychological plausibility and testability with the given data.

However, while the recovery for `bias` (r~0.82) and `sensitivity` (r~0.79) remained good, the recovery for the new `alpha_log_ineq` parameter (r~0.67) fell below the desired threshold of 0.75.

This suggests the non-linear transformation captured important aspects of the decision process (improving fit), but its specific implementation might be interfering with parameter identifiability, particularly for the inequity sensitivity parameter.

**New Directions to Explore:**

Given the recovery issue with `alpha_log_ineq`, let's explore alternative ways to incorporate non-linearity or refine the model structure, focusing on maintaining parsimony (ideally 3 parameters) and improving parameter identifiability.

1.  **Non-Linear Utility of Gain (Primary Focus):** Perhaps the non-linearity observed in the data is better attributed to diminishing marginal utility of the monetary gain (`split_self`) rather than the inequity term. Test this by keeping the inequity term *linear* (as in the original reliable 3-parameter model) but applying a non-linear transformation to the gain term.
    *   **Option 1a (Logarithmic Gain):** `Utility = bias + sensitivity * log(split_self + 1) - alpha_ineq * inequity`
        *   Where `inequity = max(0, deserved_split - split_self)` (calculated as before).
        *   This uses 3 parameters (`bias`, `sensitivity`, `alpha_ineq`). `sensitivity` now applies to the log-transformed gain. Adding 1 avoids log(0).
    *   **Option 1b (Square Root Gain):** `Utility = bias + sensitivity * sqrt(split_self) - alpha_ineq * inequity`
        *   Similar structure, 3 parameters (`bias`, `sensitivity`, `alpha_ineq`), but uses square root to model diminishing returns.
    *   **Justification:** This approach tests a standard economic principle (diminishing marginal utility) and uses the linear inequity formulation that previously showed good parameter recovery for `alpha_ineq`. It might achieve good fit by capturing non-linearity in gain, potentially resolving the recovery issue seen when non-linearity was forced onto the inequity term.

2.  **Ratio-Based Inequity Perception (Secondary Option):** If non-linear gain doesn't resolve the issues, consider the alternative functional form for inequity based on ratios, which was suggested previously but not yet tested.
    *   **Option 2a (Log-Ratio Inequity):** `Utility = bias + sensitivity * split_self - alpha_ratio_ineq * max(0, log((deserved_split + 0.01) / (split_self + 0.01)))`
        *   Uses 3 parameters (`bias`, `sensitivity`, `alpha_ratio_ineq`). Epsilon (e.g., 0.01) is a small constant to prevent log(0) or division by zero.
    *   **Justification:** This tests if perceiving fairness as a *ratio* rather than an absolute difference provides a better fit and potentially better parameter recovery properties than the previous log-difference model. Keep the gain term linear here (`sensitivity * split_self`).

**Emphasis:**
*   Prioritize the **Non-Linear Utility of Gain** approach first (Option 1a or 1b). Explain your choice (log vs sqrt) if you have a preference.
*   Ensure your model uses exactly 3 learnable parameters.
*   Critically evaluate how your chosen structure aims to maintain the BIC/Accuracy improvements while *specifically addressing* the parameter recovery problem encountered with `alpha_log_ineq` in the last run.

<instructions>
**Analysis of Previous Attempt (Run 9):**
The prior model attempted to improve parameter recovery by using proportional gain (`split_perc`) combined with a non-linear (logarithmic) transformation of proportional inequity (`log(inequity_perc + epsilon)`). The model specification was: `Utility = bias + sensitivity_prop * split_perc - alpha_log_ineq_prop * log_inequity_perc`.

*   **Results:**
    *   BIC: 31.20 (Slightly worse than the previous linear proportional model's 31.01).
    *   Accuracy: 0.821 (Met the target > 0.82).
    *   Parameter Recovery: Failed significantly. `bias` recovery was acceptable (r=0.760), but `sensitivity_prop` recovery collapsed (r=0.118) and `alpha_log_ineq_prop` recovery remained poor (r=0.488).

*   **Conclusion:** Introducing logarithmic non-linearity to the *proportional* inequity term did not resolve, and in fact worsened, the parameter identifiability issues, particularly between gain sensitivity and inequity aversion. While accuracy was good, the model is unreliable due to poor parameter recovery.

**Your Goal for Run 10 (Final Run):**
Develop a model that achieves **excellent parameter recovery (r > 0.75 for ALL learnable parameters)** as the primary goal. Secondary goals are to maintain **good accuracy (Accuracy > 0.82)** and achieve a **reasonable BIC score (aim for BIC < 33)**. Given the persistent recovery challenges, a slight increase in BIC might be acceptable if recovery targets are met.

**New Direction: Revisit Absolute Values with Interaction**

Previous attempts with proportional values consistently struggled with recovery for sensitivity and inequity parameters. An earlier model (Run 4) using **absolute values** (`Utility = bias + sensitivity * split_self - alpha_log_ineq * log(inequity_abs + 1)`) showed more promising recovery (`sensitivity`: r=0.787, `alpha_log_ineq`: r=0.670), although it still fell short for the inequity parameter.

The persistent difficulty in separating gain and inequity effects suggests they might not exert independent influences on utility. Their impact could be **interdependent**. For this final run, let's explicitly model this potential interaction. We will revert to using **absolute monetary values** (which showed better sensitivity recovery previously) and add an **interaction term**. This will result in a 4-parameter model.

**Proposed Model Structure (Primary Focus):**

Build upon the structure of the promising Run 4 model (absolute gain, log-transformed absolute inequity) by adding an interaction term between the gain (`split_self`) and the log-inequity (`inequity_log`).

1.  **Calculate Intermediate Absolute Terms:**
    *   `total_tokens = token_self + token_opp`
    *   `contribution_ratio = (token_self / total_tokens) if total_tokens > 0 else 0.5`
    *   `deserved_split = contribution_ratio * combined_earning`
    *   `inequity_abs = max(0, deserved_split - split_self)`
    *   `inequity_log = log(inequity_abs + 1)` *(Note: using `log(x+1)` avoids issues with log(0))*

2.  **Calculate Utility with Interaction:**
    *   `Utility = bias + sensitivity * split_self - alpha_log_ineq * inequity_log + delta_interaction * split_self * inequity_log`

This model uses 4 learnable parameters:
*   `bias`: Baseline acceptance tendency.
*   `sensitivity`: Sensitivity to the *absolute amount* offered (`split_self`).
*   `alpha_log_ineq`: Sensitivity (aversion) to the *logarithm* of absolute disadvantageous inequity (`inequity_log`).
*   `delta_interaction`: Parameter capturing how the effect of log-inequity is modulated by the absolute amount offered (or vice-versa).

**Emphasis:**
*   Implement the **4-parameter absolute value model with the specified interaction term** (`delta_interaction * split_self * inequity_log`).
*   **Parameter recovery (r > 0.75 for ALL parameters)** is the most critical goal for this run.
*   Justify this approach by referencing the partial success of absolute value models (like Run 4) in terms of recovery compared to proportional models, and the hypothesis that an interaction term is needed to disentangle gain and inequity effects.
*   Ensure your model uses exactly 4 learnable parameters (`bias`, `sensitivity`, `alpha_log_ineq`, `delta_interaction`).
*   Define appropriate, generous but finite numerical bounds for all parameters. Note that the `delta_interaction` term could potentially be positive or negative, so its bounds should reflect that (e.g., -10 to 10). Consider the scale of `split_self` and `inequity_log` when setting bounds.
*   Think outside the box: While the interaction model is the primary focus, if you have a strong alternative rationale for a different 3 or 4-parameter model structure (perhaps using a different transformation or interaction) that you believe is more likely to achieve the recovery goals based on all previous run information, feel free to propose and justify it clearly.

The inequity aversion term includes an exponent parameter (`delta_ineq`) allowing sensitivity to inequity to increase (`delta_ineq` > 1) or decrease (`delta_ineq` < 1) with the magnitude of the unfairness, compared to the standard linear model (`delta_ineq` = 1). It uses four learnable parameters: `bias`, `sensitivity`, `alpha_ineq` (inequity scale), and `delta_ineq` (inequity curvature).",v0,"Okay, here are the updated instructions for the next run:

<instructions>
The previous run explored adding an advantageous inequity term (`beta_adv_ineq`) to the successful 3-parameter Fehr-Schmidt-style model (`bias`, `sensitivity`, `alpha_ineq`). While accuracy remained high (~0.815), this addition resulted in a significantly worse BIC (~45.6 vs. the best of ~38.6) and very poor parameter recovery for the new `beta_adv_ineq` parameter (r ~ 0.13). This suggests that, at least in this linear formulation, advantageous inequity aversion does not significantly improve the model's fit or identifiability for this dataset.

The best performing model identified so far is:
`total_tokens = token_self + token_opp`
`deserved_split = (combined_earning * token_self / total_tokens) if total_tokens > 0 else 0`
`inequity = max(0, deserved_split - split_self)`
`Utility = bias + sens * split_self - alpha_ineq * inequity`
This model achieved BIC ~38.6, Accuracy ~0.814, and good recovery for all parameters (r > 0.75).

Your goal for this run is to **improve upon this best-performing 3-parameter model**. Focus on achieving:

1.  **Lower BIC** (significantly below ~38.6).
2.  **Higher Accuracy** (above ~0.814).
3.  **Excellent Parameter Recovery** (all correlations preferably > 0.75).

Given that simply adding a linear advantageous inequity term was detrimental, consider modifications to the *functional form* or conceptualization of the utility components in the best 3-parameter model. Avoid merely adding parameters unless strongly justified. Here are some avenues to explore:

1.  **Non-Linearity in Disadvantageous Inequity:** The current model assumes the negative utility from disadvantageous inequity (`inequity = max(0, deserved_split - split_self)`) scales linearly via `alpha_ineq`. Is this psychologically plausible?
    *   **Power Function:** Perhaps sensitivity increases or decreases with the magnitude of the inequity. Explore `alpha_ineq * (inequity ^ delta_ineq)`. A `delta_ineq > 1` implies increasing sensitivity to larger unfairness, while `delta_ineq < 1` implies diminishing sensitivity.
    *   **Logarithmic Function:** Could the impact be logarithmic? E.g., `- alpha_ineq * log(inequity + 1)` (adding 1 to avoid log(0)).
    *   Think carefully about the range and interpretation of any new non-linearity parameter (`delta_ineq`).

2.  **Ratio-Based Fairness Perception:** Instead of the absolute *difference* (`deserved_split - split_self`), maybe fairness is judged based on the *ratio* of the offered amount to the deserved amount.
    *   How could `split_self / deserved_split` (or a related ratio) be incorporated? Consider potential issues when `deserved_split` is zero or very small. A possibility: incorporate the log-ratio `log((split_self + epsilon) / (deserved_split + epsilon))`, where epsilon is a small constant (e.g., 0.01) to handle zeros.
    *   Example structure: `Utility = bias + sensitivity * split_self - alpha_ineq * max(0, log((deserved_split + epsilon) / (split_self + epsilon)))` (Note: this captures disadvantageous inequity when the ratio is > 1, so the log is positive).

3.  **Interaction Effects:** Could the participant's sensitivity to the offered amount (`split_self`) *change* depending on how fair the offer is perceived?
    *   Explore an interaction between `split_self` and `inequity`. For example: `Utility = bias + (sensitivity_base + sensitivity_interaction * inequity) * split_self - alpha_ineq * inequity`. Here, the effective sensitivity to the offered amount is modulated by the level of unfairness. Be mindful of potential complexity and recovery issues with interaction terms.

4.  **Alternative Functional Forms for Gain:** While the linear sensitivity to `split_self` worked well, perhaps a simple non-linear transformation like `sensitivity * log(split_self + 1)` or `sensitivity * sqrt(split_self)` could capture diminishing returns on monetary gain better, potentially freeing up variance explained by other terms.

**Emphasis:** Prioritize models that offer a clear psychological interpretation and maintain parsimony (aim for 3-4 parameters maximum). Any added complexity compared to the best 3-parameter model must demonstrate clear improvements in BIC and maintain strong parameter recovery.

Your primary goal for this run is to design a model that significantly improves **parameter recovery** (aiming for correlations > 0.7 for *all* learnable parameters) while also maintaining or improving BIC and accuracy compared to a baseline BIC of ~44 and accuracy of ~0.69.

To achieve this, consider the following:

1.  **Rethink Functional Form:** Move beyond simple linear additions. Explore alternative mathematical structures:
    *   Could fairness be better represented by a **ratio** (e.g., `split_perc_self / deserved_perc_self`) instead of a difference? How would you handle division by zero if `deserved_perc_self` is 0?
    *   Are there **non-linear** effects? (e.g., sensitivity to unfairness might increase sharply below a certain threshold, or sensitivity to the offered amount might diminish at higher levels).
    *   Could there be **interaction terms** between the offered amount and the perceived fairness level? Perhaps the weight given to fairness depends on the stakes?
    *   Consider incorporating **absolute amounts** (`split_self`, `combined_earning`) perhaps alongside or instead of percentages, as perceived utility might not scale linearly with percentages alone, especially when `combined_earning` varies significantly.
    *   Explore established decision-making models like **Fehr-Schmidt utility** (which includes terms for *both* disadvantageous and advantageous inequity), but adapt them to use the contribution-based fairness norm (`deserved_perc_self`). Does getting *more* than deserved affect utility?

2.  **Parameter Identifiability:** Focus explicitly on designing a model where the learnable parameters capture distinct psychological processes (e.g., baseline acceptance, pure self-interest, sensitivity to unfairness) in a way that is statistically identifiable, minimizing potential covariance between parameter estimates. Justify *why* your proposed formulation might lead to better disentanglement than previous attempts.

3.  **Alternative Mechanisms:** Think creatively and propose potentially less obvious mechanisms.
    *   Could the 'deserved' amount act as a **reference point** in a prospect theory-like value function, where losses (offers below deserved) loom larger than gains (offers above deserved)?
    *   Could the *relative* contribution (`token_self / token_opp`) directly modulate the sensitivity to the offer, rather than just setting a fairness point?

4.  **Parsimony vs. Performance:** While parsimony (fewer parameters) is generally preferred to avoid overfitting and aid interpretation, prioritize finding a model structure that demonstrably improves parameter recovery for this task. If adding a parameter or complexity *specifically addresses* the identifiability issue and is well-justified psychologically, it may be worthwhile. Aim for a model with 2-4 well-motivated parameters.

<instructions>
The previous modeling attempt successfully used an adapted Fehr-Schmidt utility framework with absolute monetary amounts (`split_self`, `deserved_split`) rather than percentages. This approach yielded significant improvements, resulting in a model with good BIC (~38.6), high accuracy (~0.81), and strong parameter recovery (all correlations > 0.75).

Your goal for this run is to **build upon this success** or propose a well-justified alternative model to **further refine performance**. Aim to:

1.  **Decrease BIC** below the current best of ~38.6.
2.  **Increase Accuracy** above the current best of ~0.81.
3.  **Maintain Excellent Parameter Recovery** (target correlations > 0.7 or ideally > 0.8 for all learnable parameters).

Consider these avenues for improvement:

1.  **Refine the Fehr-Schmidt Structure:**
    *   **Advantageous Inequity:** The previous successful model only included disadvantageous inequity (`alpha_ineq`). Explore adding a term for advantageous inequity (`beta_adv_ineq * max(0, split_self - deserved_split)`), consistent with the full Fehr-Schmidt model. Does getting *more* than the deserved share decrease utility (due to guilt or general inequity aversion)? Adding this parameter (`beta_adv_ineq`) might capture additional variance but ensure it remains identifiable.
    *   **Non-Linear Sensitivity:** Does utility scale linearly with the monetary gain (`split_self`) or the magnitude of inequity (`inequity`)? Consider introducing simple non-linearities, for example, using power parameters (`sens * split_self ^ gamma_gain`, `alpha_ineq * inequity ^ delta_loss`). Justify why such non-linearity might be psychologically plausible (e.g., diminishing sensitivity to gains, increasing sensitivity to losses). Be mindful that added parameters can make recovery harder.

2.  **Explore Alternative Conceptualizations:**
    *   **Ratio-Based Fairness:** Instead of the *difference* (`deserved_split - split_self`), could fairness perception be better captured by a *ratio*, such as `split_self / deserved_split`? How would you incorporate this into the utility function? Consider how to handle cases where `deserved_split` is zero or very small. For example, `Utility = bias + sens * log(split_self + epsilon) - alpha_ineq * log(deserved_split + epsilon)` or `Utility = bias + sens * split_self * (split_self / (deserved_split + epsilon))^gamma`?
    *   **Reference Dependence (Prospect Theory):** Explicitly model `deserved_split` as a reference point. Define a value function `v(x)` where `x = split_self - deserved_split`. This function could exhibit loss aversion (steeper slope for `x < 0`) and potentially diminishing sensitivity. For instance: `value = x` if `x >= 0`, else `value = loss_aversion * x` (where `loss_aversion > 1`). Then `Utility = bias + value`. Or use power functions for gains and losses separately relative to the reference.

3.  **Focus on Identifiability and Parsimony:** While exploring added complexity, ensure that new parameters capture distinct psychological constructs and are likely to be statistically identifiable. Prioritize models where the parameters have clear interpretations and minimal overlap in their functional roles. Aim for 3-5 well-motivated parameters. A simpler model that maintains high performance is preferable to a complex one if the gains are marginal or recovery suffers.

<SUMMARY>
A linear utility model for responder acceptance decisions based on proportional values. Utility is calculated as a sum of a baseline acceptance tendency ('bias'), the proportion of the total earnings offered ('split_perc') weighted by a sensitivity parameter ('sensitivity_prop'), and the proportional disadvantageous inequity ('inequity_perc', calculated as the difference between the deserved proportion based on token contribution and the offered proportion) weighted by an aversion parameter ('alpha_ineq_prop'). The model uses three learnable parameters: bias, sensitivity_prop, and alpha_ineq_prop. It aims to improve parameter recovery by using normalized inputs (proportions) rather than absolute monetary values.",v0,"Okay, here are the updated instructions for the next run (Run 7):



<instructions>
The previous run (Run 6) tested a model incorporating diminishing marginal utility of gain via a logarithmic transformation: `Utility = bias + sensitivity * log(split_self + 1) - alpha_ineq * inequity`. While maintaining reasonably good BIC (~34.2) and accuracy (~0.817), this model unfortunately failed to achieve acceptable parameter recovery, with both `sensitivity` (r~0.67) and `alpha_ineq` (r~0.67) falling below the target threshold (r > 0.75).

This follows a pattern where introducing non-linearity (log-inequity in Run 5, log-gain in Run 6) improved fit compared to a simple linear model (Run 1) but compromised parameter recovery. This suggests that the standard ways of incorporating non-linearity might be creating identifiability issues between the gain and inequity sensitivity parameters, possibly due to inherent correlations when using absolute monetary values.

**Your Goal:** Develop a model that achieves **excellent parameter recovery (all r > 0.75)** while also reaching **good model fit (Target BIC < 34, Accuracy > 0.82)**. We need to break the trade-off observed between fit and recovery.

**New Direction: Normalization / Proportional Values**

Instead of focusing solely on different non-linear functions, let's explore a structural change: **normalization**. The hypothesis is that agents might evaluate offers not just based on absolute monetary amounts, but based on proportions relative to the total available amount (`combined_earning`). Using proportional gain and proportional inequity might decouple the parameters and improve identifiability.

**Proposed Model Structure (Primary Focus):**

Test a simple linear utility model, structurally similar to the first successful model (Run 1), but operating on *proportions* instead of absolute values:

1.  Calculate the participant's deserved share as a proportion:
    *   `total_tokens = token_self + token_opp`
    *   `contribution_ratio = (token_self / total_tokens) if total_tokens > 0 else 0.5`
    *   `deserved_perc = contribution_ratio`
2.  Calculate the participant's received share as a proportion:
    *   `split_perc = (split_self / combined_earning) if combined_earning > 0 else 0`
3.  Calculate the disadvantageous inequity in proportional terms:
    *   `inequity_perc = max(0, deserved_perc - split_perc)`
4.  Calculate Utility linearly based on these proportions:
    *   `Utility = bias + sensitivity_prop * split_perc - alpha_ineq_prop * inequity_perc`

This model uses 3 learnable parameters:
*   `bias`: Baseline acceptance tendency.
*   `sensitivity_prop`: Sensitivity to the *proportion* of the total earnings offered.
*   `alpha_ineq_prop`: Sensitivity (aversion) to the *proportional* difference between the deserved share and the received share.

**Emphasis:**
*   Implement the **proportional value model** described above.
*   This approach aims to directly address the parameter recovery issues seen in Runs 5 and 6 by changing the scale/nature of the inputs (proportions vs. absolute values) while using a linear form that previously showed good recovery.
*   Ensure your model uses exactly 3 learnable parameters (`bias`, `sensitivity_prop`, `alpha_ineq_prop`).
*   Define appropriate, generous but finite numerical bounds for these parameters. Consider that sensitivity to proportions (0-1 range) might require different scaling than sensitivity to absolute amounts (£0-£X).
*   Think creatively about alternative model structures if you strongly believe this normalization approach won't work, but prioritize testing this proportional model first, justifying any deviations clearly.
