The perceived fairness is measured by the difference between the share given to the proposer and the share given to the responder, and also the relative contribution of tokens. The utility function incorporates five free parameters: sensitivity to fairness (`alpha`), weight given to relative contribution (`beta`), loss aversion (`gamma`), inequity aversion (`delta`), and social utility (`epsilon`).

It incorporates sensitivity to the amount of money offered, aversion to inequitable splits (where the responder receives less than the proposer), and sensitivity to splits that don't reflect relative contributions. The model has three learnable parameters: alpha (sensitivity to money), inequity_aversion, and contribution_sensitivity.
