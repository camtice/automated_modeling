2,,"U_accept = split_opp - alpha_fairness * max(0, (combined_earning * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp))) - split_opp) * beta_gain_loss",v5,,,,The utility of accepting an offer is calculated as the offered amount minus a fairness penalty. The fairness penalty is the difference between the proportion of the combined earning that belongs to the participant based on token contribution and the offered amount. The fairness weight determines the magnitude of this penalty. There is no utility for rejecting an offer.,"Be VERY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters as the model. Have an appropriate number or learnable parameters, with a slight bias for less learnable paramters.

First, reason step by step about:
* The key psychological mechanisms involved
* How these mechanisms interact
* What mathematical form could capture these interactions
* What parameters would be needed to calibrate the model
* How the model variables map to observable behavior"
