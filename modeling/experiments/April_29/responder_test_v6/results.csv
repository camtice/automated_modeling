1,,,,,"U = alpha_fairness * (split_self - combined_earning * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp))) - beta_inequity * max(0, (split_opp - split_self))","This utility model calculates the utility of accepting an offer in the Ultimatum Game. It considers the fairness of the offer relative to the contribution of tokens, and inequity aversion, where individuals prefer equal outcomes. It utilizes two parameters: alpha_fairness (sensitivity to fairness of contribution), and beta_inequity (sensitivity to disadvantageous inequity).",v6,"Be VERY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters as the model. Have an appropriate number or learnable parameters, with a slight bias for less learnable paramters.

First, reason step by step about:
* The key psychological mechanisms involved
* How these mechanisms interact
* What mathematical form could capture these interactions
* What parameters would be needed to calibrate the model
* How the model variables map to observable behavior"
2,,,,,"U = beta + split_self - alpha * (max(0, split_opp - split_self)) * (token_opp / token_self)","This model calculates the utility of accepting an offer in the ultimatum game. It considers the amount of money offered to the participant (`split_self`), the amount offered to the opponent (`split_opp`), the participant's aversion to inequity (`alpha`), and the relative contributions of the participant and opponent to the total earnings (`token_self`, `token_opp`). The model includes a base utility term (`beta`) representing a general preference for accepting non-zero offers. The model uses two learnable parameters: alpha, which is constrained to [0, 10], and beta, which is constrained to [-5, 5].",v6,"Be VERY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters as the model.
