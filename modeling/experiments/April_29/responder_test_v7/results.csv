1,,,,,U = split_opp - alpha * (abs((split_opp / combined_earning) - (token_opp / (token_self + token_opp)))),The model calculates the utility of accepting an offer based on the amount of money offered (split_opp) and a penalty term representing inequality aversion. The penalty is proportional to the absolute difference between the percentage of the total combined_earning offered and the percentage of token contributions. The alpha parameter modulates the sensitivity to this inequality.,v7,"Be VERY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters as the model. Have an appropriate number or learnable parameters, with a slight bias for less learnable paramters.

First, reason step by step about:
* The key psychological mechanisms involved
* How these mechanisms interact
* What mathematical form could capture these interactions
* What parameters would be needed to calibrate the model
* How the model variables map to observable behavior"
2,,,,,U = alpha * (split_opp / combined_earning) + beta * (token_opp - token_self),A linear utility model for responder behavior in the ultimatum game. The utility of accepting an offer is calculated as a function of the proportion of the total money offered to the opponent and the difference in tokens found by the opponent and the participant. The model incorporates two learnable parameters: alpha (sensitivity to opponent's share) and beta (weight of token difference).,v7,"Be VERY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters as the model.
