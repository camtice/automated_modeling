The utility is determined by three components: a baseline acceptance bias, a fairness component that is weighted by the percieved fairness of the offer, and a penalty for inequity aversion, scaled by the difference between the offered split and the responder's perceived fair share. The model uses three learnable parameters: `base_acceptance` within [0, 1], `fairness_sensitivity` within [0,10], and `inequity_aversion` within [0,10].",v9,"Be VERY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters as the model.
