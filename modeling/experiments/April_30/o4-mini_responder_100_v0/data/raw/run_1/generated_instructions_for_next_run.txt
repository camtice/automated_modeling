New Instructions for Run 2 of 100:

Design a computational model to predict responder accept/reject decisions (target <target_variable>accept</target_variable>) in the ultimatum game described below. The LLM you design for this run has no memory of prior solutions, so re‐state all necessary details.  

Task Summary:  
• On each trial, participants are responders to a proposed split: split_self (their share) and combined_earning (total pot).  
• They accept (1) or reject (0).  

Model Requirements:  
1. Psychological Reasoning First  
   - Before writing any equation, think step‐by‐step through:  
     a. Key motivations: own monetary payoff vs. fairness concerns.  
     b. How fairness is perceived: linear vs. diminishing sensitivity, absolute vs. directional deviation from 50%.  
     c. Potential random “lapse” choices or decision noise.  
     d. How to separate correlated components (mean‐centering or normalizing regressors).  

2. Mathematical Form  
   - Translate your reasoning into a formal utility function U_accept.  
   - Ensure fewer than or equal to 4 learnable parameters. Include, for example, an intercept, payoff sensitivity, fairness sensitivity, and optional lapse/noise.  
   - Consider non‐linear transformations (power, log) of split_self or fairness to improve identifiability.  
   - Orthogonalize or normalize regressors (e.g., fairness = (split_self/combined_earning – 0.5)) to reduce covariance.  
   - Specify all learnable parameters with finite, psychologically plausible bounds.  

3. Choice Rule  
   - Convert utility to probability via the logistic function with temperature fixed at 1:  
     P(accept) = 1 / (1 + exp(–U_accept)).  

4. Output Format  
   - After your step‐by‐step reasoning, provide:  
     <MODEL>  
     (Only the mathematical utility formula)  
     </MODEL>  
     <VARIABLES>  
     (JSON detailing every variable, its source, learnable status, range bounds, and any distribution)  
     </VARIABLES>  
     <target_variable>accept</target_variable>  
     <SUMMARY>  
     (Concise, descriptive summary of the model mechanics)  
     </SUMMARY>  

5. Creativity Encouraged  
   - You may draw on prospect theory style reference points, piecewise value functions, or lapse/guess rates—so long as parameters remain identifiable and recoverable (> .7).  

Objective: Aim to lower BIC, raise accuracy, and achieve parameter recovery above 0.7 for all learnable parameters. Be explicit, rigorous, and innovative.
