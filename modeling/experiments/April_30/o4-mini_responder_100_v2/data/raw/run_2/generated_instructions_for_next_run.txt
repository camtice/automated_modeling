Be bold and go beyond a single squared‐inequity term. Your goal is to build a compact (≤3 learnable parameters), interpretable logistic utility model that (a) captures self‐interest and asymmetric fairness sensitivities, (b) yields a lower BIC, higher accuracy, and strong parameter recovery (r > 0.8 on all parameters), and (c) fits the responder “accept” outcome.

1. Psychological Drivers & Transformations  
   • Separate disadvantageous and advantageous inequity: define two fairness metrics—one activated when share <50% (“envy”), one when share >50% (“guilt”).  
   • Consider a non‐linear sensitivity (e.g. power, absolute value) so that small deviations feel smaller than large ones.  
   • Orthogonalize fairness from self‐interest by residualizing: regress fairness metrics on z_share and use residuals to ensure near zero correlation.

2. Model Form & Constraints  
   • Between <MODEL>…</MODEL>, specify:  
     – An intercept.  
     – One weight for self‐interest (z_share).  
     – One weight that applies piecewise to disadvantageous vs advantageous residualized fairness.  
   • No more than three learnable parameters.  
   • Bound each parameter tightly (e.g. [–3,3] or [–2,2]) to aid recovery.  
   • Use a logistic link with temperature 1.

3. Standardization & Orthogonalization  
   • Compute z_share = (split_self/combined_earning – μ_share)/σ_share across responder trials.  
   • Let raw_fairness = |split_self/combined_earning – 0.5|.  
   • Split raw_fairness into raw_dis = max(0, 0.5 – share) and raw_adv = max(0, share – 0.5).  
   • Residualize each: res_dis = raw_dis − ŷ_dis (fit raw_dis ∼ z_share), and similarly res_adv. Then z‐score res_dis and res_adv.

4. Parameter Recovery & Fit Criteria  
   • Simulate ≥200 datasets using true parameters drawn uniformly from your specified bounds.  
   • Re‐fit the model to each simulated dataset.  
   • Require Pearson r > 0.80 for every learnable parameter.  
   • Report average BIC across control and treatment groups; target a reduction of ≥5 points relative to the baseline.  
   • Report accuracy on held‐out or cross‐validated responder trials.

5. Variable Specification (<VARIABLES>…</VARIABLES>)  
   • For each learnable parameter: include description, finite bounds, uniform priors, and plan for recovery sims.  
   • For calculated predictors: document the standardization and residualization steps.  
   • Identify <target_variable>accept</target_variable>.

6. Summary (<SUMMARY>…</SUMMARY>)  
   • Briefly describe the psychological rationale: asymmetric fairness (envy vs guilt), self‐interest.  
   • Note the non‐linear/orthogonalization steps.  
   • Explain why tighter bounds, residualization, and piecewise fairness should boost identifiability, lower BIC, and improve recovery and accuracy.

Be creative—piecewise or non‐linear transforms are encouraged so long as you remain within three learnable parameters.
