New Instructions for Run 6:

Be inventively rigorous—your goal is a compact (≤4 learnable parameters), psychologically grounded logistic utility model whose every parameter recovers with Pearson r > 0.80, yields at least a 5-point BIC drop versus the baseline, and pushes accuracy up by ≥5%.

1. Feature Engineering & Diagnostics  
   • Compute share = split_self/combined_earning and z_share over responder trials.  
   • Construct raw_dis = max(0, 0.5 – share) and raw_adv = max(0, share – 0.5).  
   • Orthogonalize raw_dis and raw_adv relative to z_share via Gram–Schmidt or residualizing + z-scoring → res_dis_z, res_adv_z.  
   • AFTER orthogonalization, compute pairwise correlations and VIFs among {z_share, res_dis_z, res_adv_z}. If any VIF > 4 or |corr| > 0.3, fallback to one of:  
     – a single symmetric fairness term: raw_fair = z-score(|share – 0.5|), or  
     – PCA on {raw_dis, raw_adv}, keep first component as res_fair_pca.

2. Model Formulation & Constraints  
   • Propose TWO candidate model forms (choose one at deployment):  
     A. Asymmetric: U = α + β·z_share + γ_envy·res_dis_z + γ_guilt·res_adv_z  
     B. Simpler: U = α + β·z_share + γ·res_fair (either symmetric |share–0.5| or PCA)  
   • No more than four learnable parameters.  
   • Strong sign/bound constraints to aid identifiability:  
     – β ∈ [0,1] (self‐interest must increase U),  
     – γ_envy ∈ [–1,0] (disadvantageous inequality lowers U),  
     – γ_guilt ∈ [0,1] (advantageous inequality raises or lowers U depending on sign hypothesis),  
     – or γ ∈ [–1,1] for symmetric fairness.  
   • Use logistic link (temperature=1):  
     P_accept = 1⁄(1+exp(–U)).

3. Automated Recovery‐Driven Loop  
   • Simulate ≥1,000 synthetic datasets sampling true parameters from the prescribed bounds.  
   • Fit your chosen model to each dataset.  
   • If any parameter’s Pearson r < 0.80, automatically:  
     – reshape the feature set (switch between asymmetric vs symmetric fairness),  
     – tighten bounds to [–0.5,0.5] or enforce stronger sign constraints,  
     – re-run simulations until all r > 0.80.

4. Cross-Validation & BIC Reporting  
   • On the real data, conduct 5-fold cross-validation to estimate out-of-sample accuracy.  
   • Compute BIC separately for control and treatment; require ≥5-point improvement over the canonical baseline model.

5. Variable Specification (<VARIABLES>…</VARIABLES>)  
   • For each learnable parameter: clear description, numeric bounds (as above), uniform prior, source=learnable.  
   • For each calculated predictor: document the exact standardization or PCA step.  
   • Declare <target_variable>accept</target_variable>.

6. Summary (<SUMMARY>…</SUMMARY>)  
   • Briefly contrast the two candidate forms (asymmetric vs symmetric fairness) and the adaptive recovery loop.

New Instructions for Run 9:

1. Embrace Nonlinearity & Mixtures  
   • In addition to pure logistic, consider alternative link functions (probit, clog-log) in parallel and compare.  
   • Build a 2-component mixture-of-experts: one “self-interest” expert (uses z_share) and one “fairness” expert (uses one or more orthogonalized fairness features). Use a gating function g(z_share, z_mag)→[0,1] with 2 parameters to weight them.  

2. Dynamic & Psychologically‐Grounded Features  
   • Trial‐wise adaptation: include a learning or fatigue feature ΔU = U_{t−1} − U_{t−2}, or running average of past acceptance.  
   • Represent inequity as both magnitude (|share−0.5|) and log‐ratio log(share/(1−share)), then orthogonalize.  
   • Optionally include an interaction with trial_role or trial_type to capture role‐specific sensitivity.

      U_probit = α′ + β′·z_share + γ′·orth_fair;  
      Choose best link per fold via Bayesian model averaging.  

4. Strong Yet Adaptive Regularization  
   • Use Student-t(3,0,1) priors on all weights for robustness.  
   • Bounds: all linear weights ∈[−1,1], curvature φ∈[0.5,2].  
   • L1+L2 elastic‐net penalty: tune mixing hyperparameter in recovery loop.  

5. Automated Multi-Stage Recovery & Pruning  
   • Stage 1: Simulate 2,000 datasets from priors; fit MAP or penalized MLE; compute Pearson r.  
   • Stage 2: If any r<0.80 or identifiability issues:  
     – Prune worst‐recovered parameter(s) or collapse experts (e.g. tie α1=α2).  
     – Simplify gating or fix φ to nearest gridpoint.  
     – Refit until each r≥0.80.  

6. Comprehensive Validation  
   • 10-fold nested CV with out-of-sample accuracy and log‐score averaging.

Run 54 Instructions:

1. Candidate Families (exactly 3). Propose three strictly‐monotonic U(dev_std)=α+f(dev_std;θ) each with ≤2 non‐intercept θ’s. You must include:
   • One classic (choose from Power, Exponential, or Logistic).  
   • One novel two‐parameter form of your own design (e.g. f=β·(1–exp(–(γ·dev_std)^p)) or f=β·sinh(γ·dev_std)/(1+|sinh(γ·dev_std)|)).  
   • One flexible but identifiable form (e.g. rational‐power, shifted‐logistic, or polynomial+exp combination).

2. Feature Standardization & Orthogonalization  
   a. Drop trials with combined_earning=0.  
   b. Compute z_share=split_self/combined_earning; winsorize to [0.01,0.99].  
   c. Compute dev=|z_share–0.5|; winsorize to [0,2].  
   d. On training set, compute median μ_dev and MAD σ_dev; define dev_c = (dev–μ_dev)/σ_dev and use dev_c as “dev_std” everywhere.  
   e. Optionally include dev_sq=dev_c^2 or log1p(dev_c) as auxiliary inputs in your formula if it boosts identifiability, but still produce a single scalar U.

3. Parameter Bounds, Reparameterization & Priors  
   • α_un∈ℝ, parametrized directly; α=clip(α_un,–0.06,0.06). Prior: α_un∼Normal(0,0.01).

   • Shape parameters φ_un (for each p,γ,k,…): use φ=exp(φ_un) to enforce φ∈[0.5,2]; solve exp(φ_un)∈[0.5,2] via φ_un∼TruncatedNormal(log(1),0.25)[log(0.5),log(2)].  
   • This log‐space reparameterization typically improves recovery.

4. Choice Rule with Lapse  
   P_accept = (1–λ)·σ(U) + λ/2, where σ(U)=1/(1+exp(–U)), λ=0.02 fixed.

   • Any family failing either stage is discarded.

6. Model Selection & Validation  
   • 20 repeats × 5‐fold CV → report mean±SD Accuracy, AUC, BIC, WAIC, ΔBIC vs. runner‐up, Brier score.  
   • Calibration: slope ∈[0.95,1.05], intercept ≤0.05 over six equal‐mass dev_std bins.

7. Final Winner Criteria

   • One classic (choose from Power, Exponential, or Logistic).  
   • One novel two‐parameter form of your own design (e.g. f=β·(1–exp(–(γ·dev_std)^p)) or f=β·sinh(γ·dev_std)/(1+|sinh(γ·dev_std)|)).  
   • One flexible but identifiable form (e.g. rational‐power, shifted‐logistic, or polynomial+exp combination).

1. Candidate Families (exactly 3). Propose three strictly‐monotonic U(dev_std)=α+f(dev_std;θ) each with ≤2 non‐intercept θ’s. You must include:
   • One classic (choose from Power, Exponential, or Logistic).  
   • One novel two‐parameter form of your own design (e.g. f=β·(1–exp(–(γ·dev_std)^p)) or f=β·sinh(γ·dev_std)/(1+|sinh(γ·dev_std)|)).  
   • One flexible but identifiable form (e.g. rational‐power, shifted‐logistic, or polynomial+exp combination).

   a. Drop trials with combined_earning=0.  
   b. Compute z_share=split_self/combined_earning; winsorize to [0.01,0.99].

   • One novel two‐parameter form of your own design (e.g. f=β·(1–exp(–(γ·dev_std)^p)) or f=β·sinh(γ·dev_std)/(1+|sinh(γ·dev_std)|)).  
   • One flexible but identifiable form (e.g. rational‐power, shifted‐logistic, or polynomial+exp combination).

Run 54 Instructions:

1. Candidate Families (exactly 3). Propose three strictly‐monotonic U(dev_std)=α+f(dev_std;θ) each with ≤2 non‐intercept θ’s. You must include:
   • One classic (choose from Power, Exponential, or Logistic).  
   • One novel two‐parameter form of your own design (e.g. f=β·(1–exp(–(γ·dev_std)^p)) or f=β·sinh(γ·dev_std)/(1+|sinh(γ·dev_std)|)).  
   • One flexible but identifiable form (e.g. rational‐power, shifted‐logistic, or polynomial+exp combination).

2. Feature Standardization & Orthogonalization  
   a. Drop trials with combined_earning=0.  
   b. Compute z_share=split_self/combined_earning; winsorize to [0.01,0.99].  
   c. Compute dev=|z_share–0.5|; winsorize to [0,2].  
   d. On training set, compute median μ_dev and MAD σ_dev; define dev_c = (dev–μ_dev)/σ_dev and use dev_c as “dev_std” everywhere.  
   e. Optionally include dev_sq=dev_c^2 or log1p(dev_c) as auxiliary inputs in your formula if it boosts identifiability, but still produce a single scalar U.

3. Parameter Bounds, Reparameterization & Priors  
   • α_un∈ℝ, parametrized directly; α=clip(α_un,–0.06,0.06). Prior: α_un∼Normal(0,0.01).  
   • θ‐scale parameter β_un∈ℝ; β=tanh(β_un)·0.08 to ensure |β|≤0.08. Prior: β_un∼Normal(0,0.5).  
   • Shape parameters φ_un (for each p,γ,k,…): use φ=exp(φ_un) to enforce φ∈[0.5,2]; solve exp(φ_un)∈[0.5,2] via φ_un∼TruncatedNormal(log(1),0.25)[log(0.5),log(2)].  
   • This log‐space reparameterization typically improves recovery.

4. Choice Rule with Lapse

   • Stage B: 10 000 sims → require r ≥0.95 & |bias| ≤0.03.  
   • Any family failing either stage is discarded.

6. Model Selection & Validation  
   • 20 repeats × 5‐fold CV → report mean±SD Accuracy, AUC, BIC, WAIC, ΔBIC vs. runner‐up, Brier score.  
   • Calibration: slope ∈[0.95,1.05], intercept ≤0.05 over six equal‐mass dev_std bins.

7. Final Winner Criteria  
   • All θ’s pass Stage B.  
   • ΔBIC ≥12 vs. next‐best.

   • One classic (choose from Power, Exponential, or Logistic).  
   • One novel two‐parameter form of your own design (e.g. f=β·(1–exp(–(γ·dev_std)^p)) or f=β·sinh(γ·dev_std)/(1+|sinh(γ·dev_std)|)).  
   • One flexible but identifiable form (e.g. rational‐power, shifted‐logistic, or polynomial+exp combination).

Run 54 Instructions:

1. Candidate Families (exactly 3). Propose three strictly‐monotonic U(dev_std)=α+f(dev_std;θ) each with ≤2 non‐intercept θ’s. You must include:
   • One classic (choose from Power, Exponential, or Logistic).  
   • One novel two‐parameter form of your own design (e.g. f=β·(1–exp(–(γ·dev_std)^p)) or f=β·sinh(γ·dev_std)/(1+|sinh(γ·dev_std)|)).  
   • One flexible but identifiable form (e.g. rational‐power, shifted‐logistic, or polynomial+exp combination).

2. Feature Standardization & Orthogonalization  
   a. Drop trials with combined_earning=0.  
   b. Compute z_share=split_self/combined_earning; winsorize to [0.01,0.99].  
   c. Compute dev=|z_share–0.5|; winsorize to [0,2].  
   d. On training set, compute median μ_dev and MAD σ_dev; define dev_c = (dev–μ_dev)/σ_dev and use dev_c as “dev_std” everywhere.  
   e. Optionally include dev_sq=dev_c^2 or log1p(dev_c) as auxiliary inputs in your formula if it boosts identifiability, but still produce a single scalar U.

3. Parameter Bounds, Reparameterization & Priors  
   • α_un∈ℝ, parametrized directly; α=clip(α_un,–0.06,0.06). Prior: α_un∼Normal(0,0.01).  
   • θ‐scale parameter β_un∈ℝ; β=tanh(β_un)·0.08 to ensure |β|≤0.08. Prior: β_un∼Normal(0,0.5).  
   • Shape parameters φ_un (for each p,γ,k,…): use φ=exp(φ_un) to enforce φ∈[0.5,2]; solve exp(φ_un)∈[0.5,2] via φ_un∼TruncatedNormal(log(1),0.25)[log(0.5),log(2)].  
   • This log‐space reparameterization typically improves recovery.

4. Choice Rule with Lapse  
   P_accept = (1–λ)·σ(U) + λ/2, where σ(U)=1/(1+exp(–U)), λ=0.02 fixed.

5. Two‐Stage Recovery & Identifiability  
   • Stage A: 5 000 sims → MAP fit → require Pearson r ≥0.90 & |bias| ≤0.05 for all θ.  
   • Stage B: 10 000 sims → require r ≥0.95 & |bias| ≤0.03.  
   • Any family failing either stage is discarded.

6. Model Selection & Validation  
   • 20 repeats × 5‐fold CV → report mean±SD Accuracy, AUC, BIC, WAIC, ΔBIC vs. runner‐up, Brier score.  
   • Calibration: slope ∈[0.95,1.05], intercept ≤0.05 over six equal‐mass dev_std bins.

7. Final Winner Criteria  
   • All θ’s pass Stage B.  
   • ΔBIC ≥12 vs. next‐best.  
   • Accuracy gain ≥18% over linear baseline U=α+β·dev_std_c.  
   • AUC ≥0.84.  
   • Brier score < baseline.

8. Deliverables

   • <VARIABLES>…</VARIABLES>: JSON with every feature (dev_std_c, optional dev_sq/log1p), α_un, β_un, shape φ_un’s, including transformed bounds, priors (as distribution objects), learnable flags, source.
