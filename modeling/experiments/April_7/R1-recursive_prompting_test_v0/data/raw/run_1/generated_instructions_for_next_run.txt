Okay, let's look at the previous results. The model had a BIC of 32.49, which is okay, but maybe we can improve. The accuracy was around 78.5%, which is decent but there's room for improvement. The parameter recovery for alpha was only 0.533, which is moderate, while beta was 0.94, which is good. So the main issue is alpha's recovery.

Why is alpha's recovery lower? Maybe the model's alpha parameter isn't well-identified. High covariance between parameters could be a problem, but the model only has two parameters. Alternatively, the model's structure might not capture the underlying psychological mechanisms well enough. For example, the current model combines equity and equality linearly, but maybe participants use a different weighting or nonlinear combination.

The previous instructions told the model to consider high covariance and use fewer parameters. But since alpha's recovery is low, perhaps the model needs a different functional form for alpha's role. Maybe introducing a nonlinearity could help. For example, using a sigmoid function to transform alpha, or allowing different weights for over vs. under offers.

Another thought: the current model uses a linear combination of equity and equality. Maybe participants have different sensitivities when their share is below versus above the reference. For instance, they might be more sensitive to receiving less than their fair share. Adding a parameter to differentiate between these could improve the model, even if it adds another parameter. But the previous run had two parameters, and adding a third might complicate recovery. However, if the parameters are orthogonal, it might help.

Alternatively, the model could use a reference point that's a nonlinear combination of equity and equality. For example, alpha could determine a convex combination, but with a nonlinear scaling. Or, the model could include a term that accounts for the difference between the proposed split and both equity and equality, allowing for separate weights.

Another angle: the current model's utility is split_self minus the reference plus beta. Maybe the way beta is incorporated could be adjusted. For example, beta could be a scaling factor for the entire utility, or interact with another variable. But that might not directly address alpha's recovery.

Also, the model's variables: combined_earning is used, but maybe including token_opp could add more information. Although token_opp is part of combined_earning, explicitly using it might help. Wait, the current model already uses token_self and combined_earning, which includes token_opp indirectly. But maybe an explicit term for the opponent's contribution could help.

Wait, the equity term is 3*token_self, which is the participant's contribution in pounds. The equality term is 0.5*combined_earning. But maybe participants compare their split to both their own contribution and the opponent's. For example, the ratio of split_self to their contribution versus split_opp to the opponent's contribution. That could be another fairness measure.

Alternatively, the model could include a term for the difference between split_self and split_opp, but that might not be necessary since split_opp is determined by split_self and combined_earning.

Another idea: the current model uses a static alpha, but maybe alpha varies depending on the trial type. For example, if the participant contributed more (trial_type 3), they might weight equity higher. But trial_type is a data variable, so the model can't use it unless it's included. However, the instructions say to use the provided variables, so maybe incorporating trial_type could improve the model. But the previous model didn't use trial_type, so maybe that's a direction.

But the model needs to predict based on the available variables. If trial_type is available, perhaps including an interaction term with alpha. For example, alpha could be modulated by trial_type. But that would require additional parameters, which might complicate things.

Alternatively, the model could have separate alphas for different trial types, but that would increase the number of parameters. However, given that the previous model had only two parameters, adding a third might be manageable if it significantly improves fit and recovery.

Another consideration: the utility function's linearity might not capture diminishing sensitivity. For example, a £1 difference from the reference might matter more when the reference is small. Using a nonlinear transformation (e.g., log, square root) could help, but that adds complexity.

The previous instructions emphasized avoiding high covariance and fewer parameters. But since alpha's recovery is problematic, maybe allowing a more flexible model with an additional parameter could help, even if it slightly increases the parameter count. The key is to ensure parameters are identifiable.

So, the new instructions should encourage exploring different functional forms for combining equity and equality, possibly introducing nonlinearities or interaction terms. Also, consider parameters that account for asymmetric sensitivity to gains and losses relative to the reference. Additionally, using trial_type or other variables to modulate alpha or beta could improve the model's flexibility.

The revised instructions should guide the model to:

1. Explore nonlinear combinations of equity and equality (e.g., multiplicative terms, sigmoid weights).
2. Consider asymmetric parameters for over vs. under offers relative to the reference.
3. Use trial_type or other variables to modulate fairness weights.
4. Ensure parameters are orthogonal to improve recovery.
5. Maintain a balance between model complexity and parameter identifiability.

By encouraging these directions, the next model might better capture the underlying decision processes, leading to improved accuracy, lower BIC, and better parameter recovery, especially for alpha.

**Instructions for Run 2/10:**  
Focus on improving alpha recovery (r=0.533) while maintaining beta's strong performance. Consider these directions:  

1. **Nonlinear Fairness Integration**  
   - Explore multiplicative interactions between equity/equality terms (e.g., α*(equity term)*(equality term))  
   - Test sigmoidal weighting functions for alpha rather than linear blending  

2. **Asymmetric Sensitivity**  
   - Implement separate parameters for responses to:  
     a) Offers below vs. above reference points  
     b) Equity violations vs. equality violations  

3. **Context-Dependent Weighting**  
   - Allow alpha to dynamically scale with contribution ratios (token_self/token_opp)  
   - Consider trial_type-dependent fairness rules (e.g., different weights when participant contributed more)  

4. **Parameter Orthogonality**  
   - Introduce mathematically orthogonal terms (e.g., interaction terms with near-zero covariance)  
   - Test power transformations (x^γ) of key variables to decouple parameter influences
