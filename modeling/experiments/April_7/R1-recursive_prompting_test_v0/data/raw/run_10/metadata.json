  "instructions": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's analyze the previous results. The last model had a BIC of 33.44, accuracy around 0.797, and parameter recovery for alpha (0.637), beta (0.780), and theta (0.356). Theta's recovery was particularly low, indicating issues with identifiability or model structure. The model included three parameters: alpha (sensitivity to deviation), beta (baseline acceptance), and theta (opponent contribution weighting).\n\nThe problem seems to be that theta isn't being recovered well. Maybe the way theta is incorporated into the fairness calculation isn't capturing the right dynamics. Also, the baseline beta might be collinear with alpha, making it harder to estimate both. The previous instructions tried a more complex model with lambda, beta, gamma, kappa, and rho, but that might have been too complex, leading to higher BIC.\n\nTo improve parameter recovery and lower BIC, we need a model that better disentangles the parameters. Let's consider removing the baseline beta parameter to reduce collinearity. Instead, model the baseline as part of the utility function through another mechanism. Also, rethinking the fairness calculation to make theta's role more distinct.\n\nAnother angle: The previous model used a linear combination of deviation from fair share plus a baseline. Maybe introducing nonlinearities, like prospect theory's value function, could better capture how participants perceive gains and losses relative to their fairness reference. This would separate gain and loss sensitivities, which might improve parameter recovery.\n\nAdditionally, the low recovery for theta suggests that the way opponent contributions are weighted isn't aligning with participants' actual behavior. Perhaps participants adjust their fairness expectations based on the trial type (e.g., whether they contributed more, less, or equal). Incorporating trial_type into the model could help, but that adds parameters. Alternatively, use a dynamic weighting that depends on the relative contributions.\n\nHere's a plan for the new instructions:\n\n1. **Dynamic Fairness Weighting:** Replace theta with a function that adjusts the weight on opponent's tokens based on the relative contribution. For example, use a sigmoid function to smoothly transition between weighting schemes depending on whether the participant contributed more or less.\n\n2. **Prospect-Theoretic Utility:** Split the deviation into gains and losses relative to the fair share, applying different power functions for each. This introduces separate parameters for gain and loss sensitivity, which can improve identifiability.\n\n3. **Trial-Type Modulation:** Allow the fairness calculation to be modulated by the trial_type (equal, opponent more, participant more) through interaction terms, but keep the number of parameters manageable.\n\n4. **Remove Baseline Parameter:** Eliminate the beta parameter to reduce collinearity and focus the model on the deviation from fairness.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the model can better capture the underlying decision processes, leading to improved parameter recovery and lower BIC.\n\n</think>\n\n**Instructions for Run 10:**  \nDesign a **neuroeconomic bargaining model** that implements *adaptive norm enforcement* through these mechanisms:  \n\n1. **Dynamic Contribution Elasticity:**  \n   ```  \n   fairness_weight = 1 / (1 + exp(-\u03c4*(token_self - token_opp)))  \n   fair_share = [fairness_weight * token_self + (1 - fairness_weight) * \u03b7] / [fairness_weight * (token_self + token_opp) + (1 - fairness_weight)*2\u03b7] * combined_earning  \n   ```  \n   - \u03c4 \u2208 [0.1,5] controls *sensitivity to contribution asymmetry*  \n   - \u03b7 \u2208 [1,10] represents *minimum acceptable equality floor*  \n\n2. **Dual-Channel Disappointment Coding:**  \n   ```  \n   U = \u03b2_gain*(split_self - fair_share)^\u03b3 - \u03b2_loss*|fair_share - split_self|^{1.7} + \u03c0*log(1 + split_self/historical_median)  \n   ```  \n   - \u03b3 \u2208 [0.3,0.9] governs *diminishing returns for advantageous inequality*  \n   - \u03b2_gain \u2208 [0.5,3] and \u03b2_loss \u2208 [0.5,3] control asymmetric sensitivity  \n   - \u03c0 \u2208 [-2,2] captures *greed acclimation* relative to `historical_median`  \n\n3. **Adaptive Reference Updating:**  \n   ```  \n   historical_median = percentile_trimmed_mean(split_self_prev, 0.2)  \n   ```  \n   Where `percentile_trimmed_mean` discards extreme 20% of previous offers  \n\n**Radical Constraints:**  \n- Use exactly 6 parameters: \u03c4, \u03b7, \u03b2_gain, \u03b2_loss, \u03b3, \u03c0  \n- Enforce \u03b2_loss > \u03b2_gain through parameterization \u03b2_loss = \u03b2_gain + \u03b4 where \u03b4 \u2208 [0.1,2]  \n- Force \u03b3 < 0.9 through hard optimization constraints  \n\n**Validation Targets:**  \n- Achieve \u03c4-\u03b3 correlation > 0.9 in parameter recovery  \n- Keep BIC < 32 through strategic nonlinearity  \n- Test if \u03c0 > 0 predicts 15% higher acceptance of unfavorable offers after generous sequences  \n\n**Provocation:** Could responders be modeling proposer *intent* through offer sequences rather than static fairness?

      "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts whether a participant (as the responder) accepts or rejects a proposal. The model needs to focus on responder behavior, use the given variables appropriately, and have learnable parameters with specified bounds. Also, the utility should predict the probability of acceptance via a logistic function.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which variables are relevant for the responder's decision. The target variable is \"accept\", so the model should predict this based on the proposer's offer and other situational factors.\n\nKey variables from the dataset that might influence the responder's decision:\n- token_self and token_opp: These represent the contributions of the participant and opponent, which affect the total combined_earning. The fairness of the split might depend on these contributions.\n- split_self and split_opp: The proposed amounts for the participant and opponent. The responder's share (split_self) compared to what's fair given their contribution (token_self) could be crucial.\n- combined_earning: The total amount to split, which might influence the stakes of the decision.\n\nThe model needs to calculate a utility based on these variables. A common approach in behavioral economics is to use a utility function that includes both the monetary gain and a term for fairness or inequity aversion.\n\nLet me think about inequity aversion. In the Fehr-Schmidt model, utility depends on one's own payoff and the difference from others. But here, the fairness might be based on the contributions (tokens) rather than just the split amounts. For example, if the participant contributed more tokens, they might expect a higher share.\n\nSo, the fair share for the participant could be calculated as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. The actual split_self is compared to this fair share. The difference between split_self and the fair share would affect utility.\n\nAdditionally, there might be a baseline tendency to accept or reject, independent of the fairness. So, parameters could represent sensitivity to unfairness and a baseline acceptance bias.\n\nPutting this together, the utility (U) could be modeled as:\n\nU = \u03b20 + \u03b21 * (split_self - fair_share)\n\nWhere:\n- \u03b20 is a baseline utility (if positive, more likely to accept)\n- \u03b21 is the sensitivity to deviations from the fair share. If \u03b21 is positive, then offers above the fair share increase utility, making acceptance more likely.\n\nThe probability of accepting would then be the logistic function of U: P(accept=1) = 1 / (1 + exp(-U)).\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the utility should be such that less than 0 corresponds to less than 50% probability. The logistic function maps U to probabilities where U=0 gives 0.5, so this aligns.\n\nNow, considering the parameters \u03b20 and \u03b21. These need to be learnable with finite bounds. For \u03b20, a reasonable range might be [-5, 5], allowing for a strong baseline bias. For \u03b21, since it's a sensitivity parameter, perhaps [0, 10] to ensure it's positive (assuming that getting more than fair share increases utility, and less decreases it).\n\nBut maybe the model should also account for different reactions to advantageous vs. disadvantageous inequity. For example, people might be more sensitive to being underpaid than overpaid. This could be modeled with separate parameters for positive and negative deviations.\n\nHowever, to keep the model simple and aligned with the task's requirement for parameter recovery, maybe stick to a linear effect. Alternatively, use an absolute value term with a parameter for the slope.\n\nAlternatively, the utility could be:\n\nU = \u03b20 + \u03b21 * (split_self - fair_share) + \u03b22 * |split_self - fair_share|\n\nBut this might complicate things. Let's start with the simpler version.\n\nAnother consideration: The combined_earning varies per trial, so the same split percentage could correspond to different absolute amounts. The model should account for the absolute difference, not just percentages.\n\nWait, the split_self is in \u00a3, so the absolute difference from the fair share is in \u00a3 terms. That's appropriate.\n\nNow, formalizing the model:\n\nFair share (S_fair) = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nUtility (U) = \u03b1 + \u03b2 * (split_self - S_fair)\n\nWhere \u03b1 is the baseline utility, \u03b2 is the sensitivity to deviation from fair share.\n\nThe probability of acceptance is logistic(U).\n\nParameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 need to be learned. Their bounds:\n\n\u03b1: [-10, 10] (generous range for baseline)\n\u03b2: [0, 20] (sensitivity can't be negative, as higher split_self should increase utility)\n\nBut maybe \u03b2 should be allowed to be negative? Wait, if \u03b2 is negative, then getting more than fair share would decrease utility, which doesn't make sense. So \u03b2 should be positive. So the range for \u03b2 is [0, 20].\n\nAlternatively, maybe the model should have separate parameters for positive and negative deviations. For example:\n\nU = \u03b1 + \u03b2_pos * max(split_self - S_fair, 0) + \u03b2_neg * min(split_self - S_fair, 0)\n\nBut this introduces two parameters instead of one. However, the problem states that the model should prioritize parameter recovery, so perhaps a simpler model with fewer parameters is better.\n\nAlternatively, use a single parameter but with a non-linear term. But the example given in the problem uses linear terms, so perhaps stick to linear.\n\nAnother variable to consider: trial_type. It indicates whether contributions are equal, opponent more, or participant more. This might affect the responder's perception of fairness. For example, if the participant contributed more (trial_type=3), they might expect a higher fair share and be more sensitive to underpayment.\n\nBut including trial_type would require interaction terms, complicating the model. Since the task says the model should use the variables appropriately but not necessarily all, maybe exclude trial_type and rely on token_self and token_opp to capture the contribution differences.\n\nAnother point: The model must predict utility, where less than 0 corresponds to less than 50% chance of acceptance. The logistic function ensures this, as when U < 0, P < 0.5.\n\nNow, checking the variables in the dataset. The variables used in the model are token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, split_self. These are all present in the dataset.\n\nThe fair share calculation uses token_self, token_opp, and combined_earning. Then, split_self is compared to this.\n\nSo the model would be:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha + beta * (split_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning)\n</MODEL>\n\nVariables:\n- alpha: learnable parameter, baseline utility\n- beta: learnable parameter, sensitivity to deviation from fair share\n- token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, split_self: data variables\n\nNow, specifying the variable descriptions in JSON format.\n\nFor alpha:\n- description: Baseline utility intercept representing inherent acceptance bias\n- range: min -10, max 10, inclusive both\n- learnable: True\n- source: learnable\n\nFor beta:\n- description: Sensitivity to deviation from fair share (per \u00a3 difference)\n- range: min 0, max 20, inclusive both\n- learnable: True\n- source: learnable\n\nOther variables (token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, split_self) are from data, so their source is 'data', not learnable.\n\nThe target variable is 'accept'.\n\nNow, the summary should describe the model concisely. It's a utility model combining baseline acceptance tendency and sensitivity to deviations from a contribution-based fair share. The fair share is computed as the participant's proportional contribution to the total tokens multiplied by the combined earnings. Utility is linear in the deviation from this fair share, with parameters for baseline and sensitivity.\n\nTesting this model: The parameters alpha and beta would be estimated from the data. The fair share is calculated based on contributions, and the difference between the proposed split and this fair share is weighted by beta. The baseline alpha captures any general tendency to accept or reject regardless of fairness.\n\nThis model should be applicable to the dataset as it uses only the required variables. The parameters have finite bounds, and the utility is unbounded, which aligns with the requirements.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha + beta * (split_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning)\n</MODEL>\n\n<target_variable>accept</target_variable>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposal\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Baseline acceptance bias parameter\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to deviation from contribution-proportional fair share\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Participant's token contribution\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Opponent's token contribution\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total combined earnings in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed \u00a3 amount for participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model where acceptance probability depends on linear deviation from contribution-proportional fairness.

  "full_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts whether a participant (as the responder) accepts or rejects a proposal. The model needs to focus on responder behavior, use the given variables appropriately, and have learnable parameters with specified bounds. Also, the utility should predict the probability of acceptance via a logistic function.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which variables are relevant for the responder's decision. The target variable is \"accept\", so the model should predict this based on the proposer's offer and other situational factors.\n\nKey variables from the dataset that might influence the responder's decision:\n- token_self and token_opp: These represent the contributions of the participant and opponent, which affect the total combined_earning. The fairness of the split might depend on these contributions.\n- split_self and split_opp: The proposed amounts for the participant and opponent. The responder's share (split_self) compared to what's fair given their contribution (token_self) could be crucial.\n- combined_earning: The total amount to split, which might influence the stakes of the decision.\n\nThe model needs to calculate a utility based on these variables. A common approach in behavioral economics is to use a utility function that includes both the monetary gain and a term for fairness or inequity aversion.\n\nLet me think about inequity aversion. In the Fehr-Schmidt model, utility depends on one's own payoff and the difference from others. But here, the fairness might be based on the contributions (tokens) rather than just the split amounts. For example, if the participant contributed more tokens, they might expect a higher share.\n\nSo, the fair share for the participant could be calculated as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. The actual split_self is compared to this fair share. The difference between split_self and the fair share would affect utility.\n\nAdditionally, there might be a baseline tendency to accept or reject, independent of the fairness. So, parameters could represent sensitivity to unfairness and a baseline acceptance bias.\n\nPutting this together, the utility (U) could be modeled as:\n\nU = \u03b20 + \u03b21 * (split_self - fair_share)\n\nWhere:\n- \u03b20 is a baseline utility (if positive, more likely to accept)\n- \u03b21 is the sensitivity to deviations from the fair share. If \u03b21 is positive, then offers above the fair share increase utility, making acceptance more likely.\n\nThe probability of accepting would then be the logistic function of U: P(accept=1) = 1 / (1 + exp(-U)).\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the utility should be such that less than 0 corresponds to less than 50% probability. The logistic function maps U to probabilities where U=0 gives 0.5, so this aligns.\n\nNow, considering the parameters \u03b20 and \u03b21. These need to be learnable with finite bounds. For \u03b20, a reasonable range might be [-5, 5], allowing for a strong baseline bias. For \u03b21, since it's a sensitivity parameter, perhaps [0, 10] to ensure it's positive (assuming that getting more than fair share increases utility, and less decreases it).\n\nBut maybe the model should also account for different reactions to advantageous vs. disadvantageous inequity. For example, people might be more sensitive to being underpaid than overpaid. This could be modeled with separate parameters for positive and negative deviations.\n\nHowever, to keep the model simple and aligned with the task's requirement for parameter recovery, maybe stick to a linear effect. Alternatively, use an absolute value term with a parameter for the slope.\n\nAlternatively, the utility could be:\n\nU = \u03b20 + \u03b21 * (split_self - fair_share) + \u03b22 * |split_self - fair_share|\n\nBut this might complicate things. Let's start with the simpler version.\n\nAnother consideration: The combined_earning varies per trial, so the same split percentage could correspond to different absolute amounts. The model should account for the absolute difference, not just percentages.\n\nWait, the split_self is in \u00a3, so the absolute difference from the fair share is in \u00a3 terms. That's appropriate.\n\nNow, formalizing the model:\n\nFair share (S_fair) = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nUtility (U) = \u03b1 + \u03b2 * (split_self - S_fair)\n\nWhere \u03b1 is the baseline utility, \u03b2 is the sensitivity to deviation from fair share.\n\nThe probability of acceptance is logistic(U).\n\nParameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 need to be learned. Their bounds:\n\n\u03b1: [-10, 10] (generous range for baseline)\n\u03b2: [0, 20] (sensitivity can't be negative, as higher split_self should increase utility)\n\nBut maybe \u03b2 should be allowed to be negative? Wait, if \u03b2 is negative, then getting more than fair share would decrease utility, which doesn't make sense. So \u03b2 should be positive. So the range for \u03b2 is [0, 20].\n\nAlternatively, maybe the model should have separate parameters for positive and negative deviations. For example:\n\nU = \u03b1 + \u03b2_pos * max(split_self - S_fair, 0) + \u03b2_neg * min(split_self - S_fair, 0)\n\nBut this introduces two parameters instead of one. However, the problem states that the model should prioritize parameter recovery, so perhaps a simpler model with fewer parameters is better.\n\nAlternatively, use a single parameter but with a non-linear term. But the example given in the problem uses linear terms, so perhaps stick to linear.\n\nAnother variable to consider: trial_type. It indicates whether contributions are equal, opponent more, or participant more. This might affect the responder's perception of fairness. For example, if the participant contributed more (trial_type=3), they might expect a higher fair share and be more sensitive to underpayment.\n\nBut including trial_type would require interaction terms, complicating the model. Since the task says the model should use the variables appropriately but not necessarily all, maybe exclude trial_type and rely on token_self and token_opp to capture the contribution differences.\n\nAnother point: The model must predict utility, where less than 0 corresponds to less than 50% chance of acceptance. The logistic function ensures this, as when U < 0, P < 0.5.\n\nNow, checking the variables in the dataset. The variables used in the model are token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, split_self. These are all present in the dataset.\n\nThe fair share calculation uses token_self, token_opp, and combined_earning. Then, split_self is compared to this.\n\nSo the model would be:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha + beta * (split_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning)\n</MODEL>\n\nVariables:\n- alpha: learnable parameter, baseline utility\n- beta: learnable parameter, sensitivity to deviation from fair share\n- token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, split_self: data variables\n\nNow, specifying the variable descriptions in JSON format.\n\nFor alpha:\n- description: Baseline utility intercept representing inherent acceptance bias\n- range: min -10, max 10, inclusive both\n- learnable: True\n- source: learnable\n\nFor beta:\n- description: Sensitivity to deviation from fair share (per \u00a3 difference)\n- range: min 0, max 20, inclusive both\n- learnable: True\n- source: learnable\n\nOther variables (token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, split_self) are from data, so their source is 'data', not learnable.\n\nThe target variable is 'accept'.\n\nNow, the summary should describe the model concisely. It's a utility model combining baseline acceptance tendency and sensitivity to deviations from a contribution-based fair share. The fair share is computed as the participant's proportional contribution to the total tokens multiplied by the combined earnings. Utility is linear in the deviation from this fair share, with parameters for baseline and sensitivity.\n\nTesting this model: The parameters alpha and beta would be estimated from the data. The fair share is calculated based on contributions, and the difference between the proposed split and this fair share is weighted by beta. The baseline alpha captures any general tendency to accept or reject regardless of fairness.\n\nThis model should be applicable to the dataset as it uses only the required variables. The parameters have finite bounds, and the utility is unbounded, which aligns with the requirements.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha + beta * (split_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning)\n</MODEL>\n\n<target_variable>accept</target_variable>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposal\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Baseline acceptance bias parameter\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to deviation from contribution-proportional fair share\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Participant's token contribution\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Opponent's token contribution\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total combined earnings in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed \u00a3 amount for participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model where acceptance probability depends on linear deviation from contribution-proportional fairness.
