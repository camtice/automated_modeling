  "instructions": "<think>\nOkay, let's look at the previous results. The model had a BIC of 32.49, which is okay, but maybe we can improve. The accuracy was around 78.5%, which is decent but there's room for improvement. The parameter recovery for alpha was only 0.533, which is moderate, while beta was 0.94, which is good. So the main issue is alpha's recovery.\n\nWhy is alpha's recovery lower? Maybe the model's alpha parameter isn't well-identified. High covariance between parameters could be a problem, but the model only has two parameters. Alternatively, the model's structure might not capture the underlying psychological mechanisms well enough. For example, the current model combines equity and equality linearly, but maybe participants use a different weighting or nonlinear combination.\n\nThe previous instructions told the model to consider high covariance and use fewer parameters. But since alpha's recovery is low, perhaps the model needs a different functional form for alpha's role. Maybe introducing a nonlinearity could help. For example, using a sigmoid function to transform alpha, or allowing different weights for over vs. under offers.\n\nAnother thought: the current model uses a linear combination of equity and equality. Maybe participants have different sensitivities when their share is below versus above the reference. For instance, they might be more sensitive to receiving less than their fair share. Adding a parameter to differentiate between these could improve the model, even if it adds another parameter. But the previous run had two parameters, and adding a third might complicate recovery. However, if the parameters are orthogonal, it might help.\n\nAlternatively, the model could use a reference point that's a nonlinear combination of equity and equality. For example, alpha could determine a convex combination, but with a nonlinear scaling. Or, the model could include a term that accounts for the difference between the proposed split and both equity and equality, allowing for separate weights.\n\nAnother angle: the current model's utility is split_self minus the reference plus beta. Maybe the way beta is incorporated could be adjusted. For example, beta could be a scaling factor for the entire utility, or interact with another variable. But that might not directly address alpha's recovery.\n\nAlso, the model's variables: combined_earning is used, but maybe including token_opp could add more information. Although token_opp is part of combined_earning, explicitly using it might help. Wait, the current model already uses token_self and combined_earning, which includes token_opp indirectly. But maybe an explicit term for the opponent's contribution could help.\n\nWait, the equity term is 3*token_self, which is the participant's contribution in pounds. The equality term is 0.5*combined_earning. But maybe participants compare their split to both their own contribution and the opponent's. For example, the ratio of split_self to their contribution versus split_opp to the opponent's contribution. That could be another fairness measure.\n\nAlternatively, the model could include a term for the difference between split_self and split_opp, but that might not be necessary since split_opp is determined by split_self and combined_earning.\n\nAnother idea: the current model uses a static alpha, but maybe alpha varies depending on the trial type. For example, if the participant contributed more (trial_type 3), they might weight equity higher. But trial_type is a data variable, so the model can't use it unless it's included. However, the instructions say to use the provided variables, so maybe incorporating trial_type could improve the model. But the previous model didn't use trial_type, so maybe that's a direction.\n\nBut the model needs to predict based on the available variables. If trial_type is available, perhaps including an interaction term with alpha. For example, alpha could be modulated by trial_type. But that would require additional parameters, which might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, the model could have separate alphas for different trial types, but that would increase the number of parameters. However, given that the previous model had only two parameters, adding a third might be manageable if it significantly improves fit and recovery.\n\nAnother consideration: the utility function's linearity might not capture diminishing sensitivity. For example, a \u00a31 difference from the reference might matter more when the reference is small. Using a nonlinear transformation (e.g., log, square root) could help, but that adds complexity.\n\nThe previous instructions emphasized avoiding high covariance and fewer parameters. But since alpha's recovery is problematic, maybe allowing a more flexible model with an additional parameter could help, even if it slightly increases the parameter count. The key is to ensure parameters are identifiable.\n\nSo, the new instructions should encourage exploring different functional forms for combining equity and equality, possibly introducing nonlinearities or interaction terms. Also, consider parameters that account for asymmetric sensitivity to gains and losses relative to the reference. Additionally, using trial_type or other variables to modulate alpha or beta could improve the model's flexibility.\n\nThe revised instructions should guide the model to:\n\n1. Explore nonlinear combinations of equity and equality (e.g., multiplicative terms, sigmoid weights).\n2. Consider asymmetric parameters for over vs. under offers relative to the reference.\n3. Use trial_type or other variables to modulate fairness weights.\n4. Ensure parameters are orthogonal to improve recovery.\n5. Maintain a balance between model complexity and parameter identifiability.\n\nBy encouraging these directions, the next model might better capture the underlying decision processes, leading to improved accuracy, lower BIC, and better parameter recovery, especially for alpha.\n</think>\n\n**Instructions for Run 2/10:**  \nFocus on improving alpha recovery (r=0.533) while maintaining beta's strong performance.

The target variable is \"accept\", so the model should predict this based on the proposer's offer and other factors related to fairness.\n\nThe key variables here are token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, split_self, and split_opp. The participant's contribution is token_self, each token being \u00a33, so their fair share based on contribution would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. However, the equality reference is 50% of combined_earning. The model should compare the proposed split (split_self) to these two references: equity (based on contribution) and equality (50/50 split).\n\nThe utility function should capture the difference between the proposed split and a weighted combination of equity and equality. Let's denote the equity reference as E = (token_self * 3) / (combined_earning) * combined_earning? Wait, combined_earning is already 3*(token_self + token_opp), so the equity share would be (3*token_self) / (3*(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning, which simplifies to token_self/(token_self + token_opp) * combined_earning. But combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so the equity share is 3*token_self. Wait, that's interesting. Because each token is \u00a33, the participant's contribution is 3*token_self, and the opponent's is 3*token_opp. So the total combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). Therefore, the equity-based fair share for the participant is exactly 3*token_self, since that's what they contributed. The equality-based fair share is 0.5 * combined_earning = 1.5*(token_self + token_opp).\n\nSo the participant's expected fair share could be a blend between these two: alpha * equity + (1 - alpha) * equality. Then, the utility is the proposed split_self minus this reference value. If the proposed amount is higher than the reference, utility is positive, making acceptance more likely. But the model also needs a parameter to scale this difference, perhaps a sensitivity parameter (beta). Additionally, there might be a baseline acceptance tendency (gamma) that affects the decision irrespective of the split.\n\nSo the utility function could be:\n\nUtility = beta * (split_self - [alpha * (3*token_self) + (1 - alpha) * (0.5 * combined_earning)]) + gamma\n\nThen, the probability of accepting is the logistic function of Utility. If Utility > 0, the probability is greater than 0.5.\n\nNow, considering the parameters:\n\n- alpha (range 0 to 1): weight between equity and equality. 0 means full equality, 1 means full equity.\n- beta (positive, maybe 0 to 10): sensitivity to the difference between offer and reference.\n- gamma (unbounded? Or maybe -5 to 5): baseline tendency to accept.\n\nBut the problem states that the utility variable may be unbounded, but parameters must have finite bounds. So alpha is between 0 and 1, beta could be between 0 and a large number (like 20), and gamma between -10 and 10.\n\nWait, the instructions say that the model should predict utility where less than 0 corresponds to less than 50% chance. The logistic function converts utility to probability as 1/(1 + exp(-Utility)). So when Utility is negative, the probability is below 0.5. That's correct.\n\nNow, variables in the dataset:\n\n- split_self is the proposed share for the participant.\n- token_self and token_opp are used to compute equity and equality references.\n- combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), which is already a variable in the dataset.\n\nSo the model can use split_self, token_self, and combined_earning directly.\n\nThe mathematical model would then be:\n\nUtility = beta * (split_self - [alpha * (3 * token_self) + (1 - alpha) * (0.5 * combined_earning)]) + gamma\n\nBut wait, combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so 0.5 * combined_earning is 1.5*(token_self + token_opp). Alternatively, since combined_earning is a variable, we can use it directly.\n\nSo the model formula is:\n\nU = \u03b2 * (split_self - [\u03b1 * (3 * token_self) + (1 - \u03b1) * (0.5 * combined_earning)]) + \u03b3\n\nThen, the probability of accept = 1 / (1 + exp(-U))\n\nNow, parameters:\n\n- \u03b1 (alpha): weight between equity and equality. Bounded between 0 and 1.\n- \u03b2 (beta): sensitivity parameter. Since it's a scaling factor, it should be positive. Bounds could be 0 to 20, for example.\n- \u03b3 (gamma): intercept term, can be negative or positive. Bounds from -10 to 10.\n\nThese parameters need to be learnable, with specified ranges.\n\nVariables in the model:\n\n- split_self: from data.\n- token_self: from data.\n- combined_earning: from data.\n- alpha, beta, gamma: learnable parameters.\n\nNow, the variable descriptions:\n\nFor the JSON part:\n\n- alpha: learnable, range [0,1], inclusive.\n- beta: learnable, range [0, 20], inclusive.\n- gamma: learnable, range [-10, 10], inclusive.\n- split_self, token_self, combined_earning: from data.\n\nThe utility U is calculated, not learnable.\n\nThe target variable is \"accept\".\n\nNow, the model needs to be written formally between <MODEL> tags.\n\nSo:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = beta * (split_self - (alpha * 3 * token_self + (1 - alpha) * 0.5 * combined_earning)) + gamma\n</MODEL>\n\nThen, variable descriptions in JSON:\n\nalpha: description is \"Weighting between equity-based (token_self) and equality-based (50/50) fairness norms\", range 0 to 1, inclusive.\n\nbeta: \"Sensitivity to deviations from fairness reference\", range 0 to 20.\n\ngamma: \"Baseline acceptance tendency\", range -10 to 10.\n\nsplit_self, token_self, combined_earning are data variables.\n\nNow, checking the instructions again: the model should predict responder behavior (accept), use variables appropriately, and have parameters with finite bounds. The utility is U, which is unbounded, and the probability is logistic(U).\n\nThis model meets the requirements. The parameters alpha, beta, gamma are learnable with specified bounds. The variables used are from the dataset. The utility is a linear combination of the difference between the proposed split and a fairness reference, scaled by beta, plus a baseline gamma.\n\nThe parameter recovery should be feasible because each parameter captures a distinct aspect: alpha is the fairness norm weight, beta is sensitivity, gamma is baseline tendency. They should be identifiable if the data has variation in the offers and contributions.\n\nFor the summary: A utility model combining equity and equality fairness norms, scaled by sensitivity and a baseline tendency. The model calculates the deviation of the proposed split from a weighted fairness reference, with learnable parameters for the weighting, sensitivity, and baseline acceptance.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU = beta * (split_self - (alpha * 3 * token_self + (1 - alpha) * 0.5 * combined_earning)) + gamma\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weighting between equity-based (token_self) and equality-based (50/50) fairness norms\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to deviations from fairness reference\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"gamma\": {\n      \"description\": \"Baseline acceptance tendency\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Participant's token count\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total shared pot in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>accept</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model combining equity-based (proportional to tokens found) and equality-based (50/50 split) fairness norms.

  "full_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts whether a participant accepts or rejects a proposal, focusing on responder behavior. The model needs to use the given variables appropriately, prioritize parameter recovery, and predict utility such that utility less than 0 corresponds to less than 50% likelihood of acceptance.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which variables are relevant for the responder's decision. The target variable is \"accept\", so the model should predict this based on the proposer's offer and other factors related to fairness.\n\nThe key variables here are token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, split_self, and split_opp. The participant's contribution is token_self, each token being \u00a33, so their fair share based on contribution would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. However, the equality reference is 50% of combined_earning. The model should compare the proposed split (split_self) to these two references: equity (based on contribution) and equality (50/50 split).\n\nThe utility function should capture the difference between the proposed split and a weighted combination of equity and equality. Let's denote the equity reference as E = (token_self * 3) / (combined_earning) * combined_earning? Wait, combined_earning is already 3*(token_self + token_opp), so the equity share would be (3*token_self) / (3*(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning, which simplifies to token_self/(token_self + token_opp) * combined_earning. But combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so the equity share is 3*token_self. Wait, that's interesting. Because each token is \u00a33, the participant's contribution is 3*token_self, and the opponent's is 3*token_opp. So the total combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). Therefore, the equity-based fair share for the participant is exactly 3*token_self, since that's what they contributed. The equality-based fair share is 0.5 * combined_earning = 1.5*(token_self + token_opp).\n\nSo the participant's expected fair share could be a blend between these two: alpha * equity + (1 - alpha) * equality. Then, the utility is the proposed split_self minus this reference value. If the proposed amount is higher than the reference, utility is positive, making acceptance more likely. But the model also needs a parameter to scale this difference, perhaps a sensitivity parameter (beta). Additionally, there might be a baseline acceptance tendency (gamma) that affects the decision irrespective of the split.\n\nSo the utility function could be:\n\nUtility = beta * (split_self - [alpha * (3*token_self) + (1 - alpha) * (0.5 * combined_earning)]) + gamma\n\nThen, the probability of accepting is the logistic function of Utility. If Utility > 0, the probability is greater than 0.5.\n\nNow, considering the parameters:\n\n- alpha (range 0 to 1): weight between equity and equality. 0 means full equality, 1 means full equity.\n- beta (positive, maybe 0 to 10): sensitivity to the difference between offer and reference.\n- gamma (unbounded? Or maybe -5 to 5): baseline tendency to accept.\n\nBut the problem states that the utility variable may be unbounded, but parameters must have finite bounds. So alpha is between 0 and 1, beta could be between 0 and a large number (like 20), and gamma between -10 and 10.\n\nWait, the instructions say that the model should predict utility where less than 0 corresponds to less than 50% chance. The logistic function converts utility to probability as 1/(1 + exp(-Utility)). So when Utility is negative, the probability is below 0.5. That's correct.\n\nNow, variables in the dataset:\n\n- split_self is the proposed share for the participant.\n- token_self and token_opp are used to compute equity and equality references.\n- combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), which is already a variable in the dataset.\n\nSo the model can use split_self, token_self, and combined_earning directly.\n\nThe mathematical model would then be:\n\nUtility = beta * (split_self - [alpha * (3 * token_self) + (1 - alpha) * (0.5 * combined_earning)]) + gamma\n\nBut wait, combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so 0.5 * combined_earning is 1.5*(token_self + token_opp). Alternatively, since combined_earning is a variable, we can use it directly.\n\nSo the model formula is:\n\nU = \u03b2 * (split_self - [\u03b1 * (3 * token_self) + (1 - \u03b1) * (0.5 * combined_earning)]) + \u03b3\n\nThen, the probability of accept = 1 / (1 + exp(-U))\n\nNow, parameters:\n\n- \u03b1 (alpha): weight between equity and equality. Bounded between 0 and 1.\n- \u03b2 (beta): sensitivity parameter. Since it's a scaling factor, it should be positive. Bounds could be 0 to 20, for example.\n- \u03b3 (gamma): intercept term, can be negative or positive. Bounds from -10 to 10.\n\nThese parameters need to be learnable, with specified ranges.\n\nVariables in the model:\n\n- split_self: from data.\n- token_self: from data.\n- combined_earning: from data.\n- alpha, beta, gamma: learnable parameters.\n\nNow, the variable descriptions:\n\nFor the JSON part:\n\n- alpha: learnable, range [0,1], inclusive.\n- beta: learnable, range [0, 20], inclusive.\n- gamma: learnable, range [-10, 10], inclusive.\n- split_self, token_self, combined_earning: from data.\n\nThe utility U is calculated, not learnable.\n\nThe target variable is \"accept\".\n\nNow, the model needs to be written formally between <MODEL> tags.\n\nSo:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = beta * (split_self - (alpha * 3 * token_self + (1 - alpha) * 0.5 * combined_earning)) + gamma\n</MODEL>\n\nThen, variable descriptions in JSON:\n\nalpha: description is \"Weighting between equity-based (token_self) and equality-based (50/50) fairness norms\", range 0 to 1, inclusive.\n\nbeta: \"Sensitivity to deviations from fairness reference\", range 0 to 20.\n\ngamma: \"Baseline acceptance tendency\", range -10 to 10.\n\nsplit_self, token_self, combined_earning are data variables.\n\nNow, checking the instructions again: the model should predict responder behavior (accept), use variables appropriately, and have parameters with finite bounds. The utility is U, which is unbounded, and the probability is logistic(U).\n\nThis model meets the requirements. The parameters alpha, beta, gamma are learnable with specified bounds. The variables used are from the dataset. The utility is a linear combination of the difference between the proposed split and a fairness reference, scaled by beta, plus a baseline gamma.\n\nThe parameter recovery should be feasible because each parameter captures a distinct aspect: alpha is the fairness norm weight, beta is sensitivity, gamma is baseline tendency. They should be identifiable if the data has variation in the offers and contributions.\n\nFor the summary: A utility model combining equity and equality fairness norms, scaled by sensitivity and a baseline tendency. The model calculates the deviation of the proposed split from a weighted fairness reference, with learnable parameters for the weighting, sensitivity, and baseline acceptance.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU = beta * (split_self - (alpha * 3 * token_self + (1 - alpha) * 0.5 * combined_earning)) + gamma\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weighting between equity-based (token_self) and equality-based (50/50) fairness norms\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to deviations from fairness reference\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"gamma\": {\n      \"description\": \"Baseline acceptance tendency\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Participant's token count\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total shared pot in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>accept</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model combining equity-based (proportional to tokens found) and equality-based (50/50 split) fairness norms.
