  "instructions": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's look at the previous run's results. The BIC was 39.31, which is higher than previous models, indicating worse fit. However, accuracy improved slightly to 0.801. The parameter recovery for alpha was really low (r=0.25), beta was good (0.925), and gamma was moderate (0.705). The main issue here is alpha's poor recovery and the higher BIC.\n\nThe previous model used a linear combination of equity and equality norms with parameters alpha, beta, gamma. The problem might be that alpha isn't identifiable when the equity and equality references are correlated or when the model doesn't sufficiently differentiate their contributions. \n\nTo improve alpha's recovery, the model needs to create situations where alpha's effect is more distinct. Maybe introducing nonlinear interactions between alpha and the fairness components. For example, if alpha modulates not just the weight but also the scaling of each component. Alternatively, using a sigmoid function to bound alpha's effect dynamically based on other variables.\n\nAnother angle: The model could incorporate an asymmetry in how equity and equality deviations are treated. For instance, participants might be more sensitive to under-equity offers but not over-equity, or vice versa. This could be modeled with separate parameters for positive and negative deviations, but we need to stay within three parameters. Maybe use a single parameter that controls the asymmetry for both equity and equality.\n\nWait, the previous model had three parameters. Let's think of a way to reparameterize to capture asymmetry without adding more parameters. For example, instead of a single beta for the deviation, have beta_equity and beta_equality, but that would require two parameters plus gamma, making four. Not allowed.\n\nAlternative idea: Use a nonlinear transformation of the deviation that depends on alpha. For example, U = beta * (split_self - [alpha * equity + (1-alpha) * equality])^3 + gamma. The cubic term would create an S-shaped curve, allowing beta to capture different sensitivities based on the direction and magnitude of the deviation. This might help in disentangling alpha and beta effects, as the cubic term amplifies larger deviations.\n\nAlternatively, use an absolute value function with a sign modulated by alpha: U = beta * |split_self - [alpha * equity + (1-alpha) * equality]| * sign(deviation) + gamma. This separates the magnitude and direction, which could help beta capture sensitivity more clearly.\n\nAnother approach: Introduce a dynamic alpha that depends on the trial's characteristics. For example, alpha could be influenced by the ratio of token_self to token_opp, but without adding a new parameter. Maybe alpha_effective = alpha * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)). This way, alpha's weight is adjusted based on the participant's contribution proportion, making it more context-dependent and possibly improving identifiability.\n\nWait, but this would still use the same alpha parameter, just scaled by data. It might not add a new parameter but could make alpha's effect more variable across trials, aiding recovery.\n\nAlternatively, model the utility as a combination of equity and equality deviations with separate nonlinearities. For example, U = beta_equity * tanh(equity_deviation) + beta_equality * tanh(equality_deviation) + gamma. But this requires two betas, which with alpha would be four parameters. Not feasible.\n\nHmm. Another idea: Use a single parameter to control the curvature of the utility function. For example, U = beta * (split_self - [alpha * equity + (1-alpha) * equality]) + gamma * (split_self - [alpha * equity + (1-alpha) * equality])^2. This introduces a quadratic term scaled by gamma, but gamma is already a baseline. This might cause multicollinearity between beta and gamma.\n\nAlternatively, apply a nonlinear scaling to the deviation term that's controlled by alpha. For example, U = beta * (split_self - [alpha * equity + (1-alpha) * equality]) / (1 + alpha * |split_self - equity| + (1-alpha) * |split_self - equality|). This makes the utility depend on the relative deviation from both norms, but it's complex and might not help.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to make the alpha parameter influence the sensitivity (beta) differently for equity and equality. For example, U = (beta * alpha) * (split_self - equity) + (beta * (1 - alpha)) * (split_self - equality) + gamma. This reparameterizes the model so that beta is scaled by alpha for equity and by (1-alpha) for equality. This ties beta and alpha together, which might improve identifiability since alpha now directly scales the beta for each component.\n\nBut in this case, the model becomes U = beta * [alpha*(split_self - equity) + (1-alpha)*(split_self - equality)] + gamma, which simplifies to the original model. So no change.\n\nAnother angle: Introduce a non-linear interaction between alpha and the combined_earning. For example, U = beta * (split_self - [alpha * 3 * token_self + (1 - alpha) * 0.5 * combined_earning]) + gamma * alpha * combined_earning. This allows gamma to vary with alpha and the total pot, but adds a term that might help in differentiating parameters.\n\nHowever, this introduces an interaction term that could complicate the model. It might not be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, use trial_type as a moderator. For example, in trial_type 3 (participant contributed more), alpha could be forced to 1, but that's too restrictive. Instead, allow alpha to be multiplied by a factor based on trial_type. For example, alpha_effective = alpha * (1 + trial_type == 3). But trial_type isn't a learnable parameter, so this would use the data to modulate alpha without adding parameters. This could help alpha's recovery by making it more context-dependent.\n\nBut how to implement this without adding parameters? Maybe:\n\nU = beta * (split_self - [alpha * (1 + delta * (trial_type == 3)) * 3 * token_self + (1 - alpha * (1 + delta * (trial_type == 3))) * 0.5 * combined_earning]) + gamma\n\nBut delta would be a new parameter. Exceeds three parameters.\n\nAlternatively, drop gamma and use trial_type to influence alpha. For example, alpha = alpha_base + alpha_mod * (trial_type == 3). But again, adds a parameter.\n\nGiven the constraints, perhaps the best approach is to introduce a nonlinear transformation of the deviation term that allows beta and gamma to have more distinct roles. For example, using a rectified linear unit (ReLU) for positive or negative deviations:\n\nU = beta * max(deviation, 0) + gamma * min(deviation, 0) + delta\n\nBut this introduces delta as a new parameter. Alternatively, set delta to zero and have:\n\nU = beta * max(deviation, 0) + gamma * min(deviation, 0)\n\nThis uses two parameters (beta, gamma) for sensitivity to over and under offers, plus alpha. But that's three parameters (alpha, beta, gamma). This could help in differentiating beta and gamma's effects, improving their recovery. Alpha still controls the fairness reference.\n\nSo the model becomes:\n\nU = beta * max(split_self - fair_ref, 0) + gamma * min(split_self - fair_ref, 0)\n\nWhere fair_ref = alpha * 3 * token_self + (1 - alpha) * 0.5 * combined_earning.\n\nThis separates the sensitivity to offers above and below the fairness reference, with beta capturing the sensitivity to generous offers and gamma to stingy ones. Alpha still determines the reference point. This could improve parameter recovery as beta and gamma now have distinct roles, and alpha's effect is isolated to the reference.\n\nThis model uses three parameters (alpha, beta, gamma) but decouples their effects. Beta and gamma now handle different aspects of the deviation, which might reduce their correlation and improve recovery. Additionally, the separation might better capture real behavior where people react differently to being over vs. under offered.\n\nTesting this model could lead to better parameter recovery for alpha, as the reference point's effect is more pronounced when deviations are split into positive and negative. Beta and gamma's recovery might also improve as they're no longer entangled in a single linear term.\n</think>\n\n**Revised Instructions for Run 5:**\n\nDesign a model that **explicitly differentiates sensitivity to offers above vs. below the fairness reference** to disentangle parameter effects. Consider these directions:\n\n1. **Asymmetric Utility:** Split the fairness deviation into positive (generous) and negative (stingy) components, each scaled by separate parameters (e.g., *\u03b2* for over-offers, *\u03b3* for under-offers). This forces distinct roles for parameters governing sensitivity.  \n   Example:  \n   `U = \u03b2*max(deviation,0) + \u03b3*min(deviation,0)`  \n   where `deviation = split_self \u2212 [\u03b1*(equity) + (1\u2212\u03b1)*(equality)]`.\n\n2. **Dynamic Reference Weighting:** Allow the equity-equality weighting (\u03b1) to interact nonlinearly with trial features (e.g., modulate \u03b1 by the relative contribution ratio `token_self/(token_self+token_opp)`), creating context-dependent fairness norms without adding parameters.\n\n3. **Nonlinear Scaling:** Apply sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent transformations to the deviation term to capture diminishing sensitivity to extreme offers, decoupling scaling (\u03b2) from baseline bias (\u03b3).\n\n**Constraints:**  \n- Retain \u22643 learnable parameters.  \n- Use only",

For example, U = (beta * alpha) * (split_self - equity) + (beta * (1 - alpha)) * (split_self - equality) + gamma. This reparameterizes the model so that beta is scaled by alpha for equity and by (1-alpha) for equality. This ties beta and alpha together, which might improve identifiability since alpha now directly scales the beta for each component.\n\nBut in this case, the model becomes U = beta * [alpha*(split_self - equity) + (1-alpha)*(split_self - equality)] + gamma, which simplifies to the original model. So no change.\n\nAnother angle: Introduce a non-linear interaction between alpha and the combined_earning. For example, U = beta * (split_self - [alpha * 3 * token_self + (1 - alpha) * 0.5 * combined_earning]) + gamma * alpha * combined_earning. This allows gamma to vary with alpha and the total pot, but adds a term that might help in differentiating parameters.\n\nHowever, this introduces an interaction term that could complicate the model. It might not be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, use trial_type as a moderator. For example, in trial_type 3 (participant contributed more), alpha could be forced to 1, but that's too restrictive. Instead, allow alpha to be multiplied by a factor based on trial_type. For example, alpha_effective = alpha * (1 + trial_type == 3). But trial_type isn't a learnable parameter, so this would use the data to modulate alpha without adding parameters. This could help alpha's recovery by making it more context-dependent.\n\nBut how to implement this without adding parameters? Maybe:\n\nU = beta * (split_self - [alpha * (1 + delta * (trial_type == 3)) * 3 * token_self + (1 - alpha * (1 + delta * (trial_type == 3))) * 0.5 * combined_earning]) + gamma\n\nBut delta would be a new parameter. Exceeds three parameters.\n\nAlternatively, drop gamma and use trial_type to influence alpha. For example, alpha = alpha_base + alpha_mod * (trial_type == 3). But again, adds a parameter.\n\nGiven the constraints, perhaps the best approach is to introduce a nonlinear transformation of the deviation term that allows beta and gamma to have more distinct roles. For example, using a rectified linear unit (ReLU) for positive or negative deviations:\n\nU = beta * max(deviation, 0) + gamma * min(deviation, 0) + delta\n\nBut this introduces delta as a new parameter. Alternatively, set delta to zero and have:\n\nU = beta * max(deviation, 0) + gamma * min(deviation, 0)\n\nThis uses two parameters (beta, gamma) for sensitivity to over and under offers, plus alpha. But that's three parameters (alpha, beta, gamma). This could help in differentiating beta and gamma's effects, improving their recovery. Alpha still controls the fairness reference.\n\nSo the model becomes:\n\nU = beta * max(split_self - fair_ref, 0) + gamma * min(split_self - fair_ref, 0)\n\nWhere fair_ref = alpha * 3 * token_self + (1 - alpha) * 0.5 * combined_earning.\n\nThis separates the sensitivity to offers above and below the fairness reference, with beta capturing the sensitivity to generous offers and gamma to stingy ones. Alpha still determines the reference point. This could improve parameter recovery as beta and gamma now have distinct roles, and alpha's effect is isolated to the reference.\n\nThis model uses three parameters (alpha, beta, gamma) but decouples their effects. Beta and gamma now handle different aspects of the deviation, which might reduce their correlation and improve recovery. Additionally, the separation might better capture real behavior where people react differently to being over vs. under offered.\n\nTesting this model could lead to better parameter recovery for alpha, as the reference point's effect is more pronounced when deviations are split into positive and negative. Beta and gamma's recovery might also improve as they're no longer entangled in a single linear term.\n</think>\n\n**Revised Instructions for Run 5:**\n\nDesign a model that **explicitly differentiates sensitivity to offers above vs. below the fairness reference** to disentangle parameter effects. Consider these directions:\n\n1. **Asymmetric Utility:** Split the fairness deviation into positive (generous) and negative (stingy) components, each scaled by separate parameters (e.g., *\u03b2* for over-offers, *\u03b3* for under-offers). This forces distinct roles for parameters governing sensitivity.  \n   Example:  \n   `U = \u03b2*max(deviation,0) + \u03b3*min(deviation,0)`  \n   where `deviation = split_self \u2212 [\u03b1*(equity) + (1\u2212\u03b1)*(equality)]`.\n\n2. **Dynamic Reference Weighting:** Allow the equity-equality weighting (\u03b1) to interact nonlinearly with trial features (e.g., modulate \u03b1 by the relative contribution ratio `token_self/(token_self+token_opp)`), creating context-dependent fairness norms without adding parameters.\n\n3. **Nonlinear Scaling:** Apply sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent transformations to the deviation term to capture diminishing sensitivity to extreme offers, decoupling scaling (\u03b2) from baseline bias (\u03b3).\n\n**Constraints:**  \n- Retain \u22643 learnable parameters.  \n- Use only\n\nPrevious Models:Not Provided\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions.",
      "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The goal is to design a model that predicts whether a responder accepts or rejects a proposal, focusing on parameter recovery and accuracy. The model should use the given variables and predict the 'accept' variable.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which variables are relevant for the responder's decision. Since we're focusing on responder behavior, we'll look at trials where trial_role is 1 (responder). The key variables here are split_self (the proposed share for the participant) and split_opp (the opponent's share). But the problem mentions that fairness isn't just about equal splits because the combined earning varies. So, the model should account for the participant's contribution (token_self) and the opponent's contribution (token_opp) to determine a fair reference point.\n\nThe utility function should compare the proposed split (split_self) to what's considered fair. The fairness reference could be a combination of equity (based on contributions) and equality (equal split). For equity, the fair share would be proportional to the participant's tokens. For equality, it's half of combined_earning. Let's model the fair reference as a weighted average between equity and equality, controlled by a parameter alpha.\n\nSo, fair_reference = alpha * (3 * token_self) + (1 - alpha) * (0.5 * combined_earning). Here, 3 * token_self is the equity value since each token is \u00a33, and 0.5 * combined_earning is the equality split.\n\nThe utility of accepting would then be the difference between the proposed split_self and this fair reference, scaled by a parameter beta. We also need a baseline parameter gamma to account for any bias towards accepting or rejecting. So, utility = beta * (split_self - fair_reference) + gamma.\n\nTo convert utility into a probability of accepting, we use the logistic function. The probability of accepting is 1 / (1 + exp(-utility)). This ensures that when utility is positive, the probability is above 0.5, and vice versa.\n\nNow, the parameters to learn are alpha (mixing equity and equality), beta (sensitivity to deviation from fairness), and gamma (baseline bias). Each needs bounds. Alpha should be between 0 and 1 since it's a weight. Beta can be any real number but realistically within a range like -10 to 10. Gamma similarly can be bounded, say -5 to 5, to keep it manageable.\n\nFor parameter recovery, it's crucial that these parameters are identifiable. By combining equity and equality into a single reference point with alpha, and scaling the deviation with beta, the model should allow recovery if the data has enough variation in token contributions and splits.\n\nVariables in the model:\n- alpha: learnable, [0,1]\n- beta: learnable, [-10,10]\n- gamma: learnable, [-5,5]\n- token_self: from data\n- combined_earning: from data\n- split_self: from data\n\nThe model equation is:\n\nutility = beta * (split_self - (alpha * 3 * token_self + (1 - alpha) * 0.5 * combined_earning)) + gamma\n\nThis utility is then passed through a logistic function to get the probability of accepting. The target variable is 'accept', a binary outcome.\n\nI need to ensure all variables used are present in the dataset. The dataset includes token_self, combined_earning, split_self, so this is feasible. Trial_role is used to filter responder trials, but the model itself doesn't need trial_role as a variable since it's only predicting for responders.\n\nThis setup should meet the requirements: uses relevant variables, has learnable parameters with bounds, and the utility is unbounded, which when passed through logistic will give the probability. The parameters alpha, beta, gamma are all within finite bounds, aiding in recovery.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nutility = beta * (split_self - (alpha * 3 * token_self + (1 - alpha) * 0.5 * combined_earning)) + gamma\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weighting between equity (token-based fairness) and equality (50/50 split) norms\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to deviations from fairness reference\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"gamma\": {\n      \"description\": \"Baseline bias toward accepting/rejecting\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -5,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Participant's token contribution (raw data)\",\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total pot size in \u00a3 (3*(token_self + token_opp))\",\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed \u00a3 amount for participant\",\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>accept</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA fairness-based utility model where responders evaluate offers against a weighted combination of equity (proportional to contributions) and equality (50/50 split) norms.

This ensures that when utility is positive, the probability is above 0.5, and vice versa.\n\nNow, the parameters to learn are alpha (mixing equity and equality), beta (sensitivity to deviation from fairness), and gamma (baseline bias). Each needs bounds. Alpha should be between 0 and 1 since it's a weight. Beta can be any real number but realistically within a range like -10 to 10. Gamma similarly can be bounded, say -5 to 5, to keep it manageable.\n\nFor parameter recovery, it's crucial that these parameters are identifiable. By combining equity and equality into a single reference point with alpha, and scaling the deviation with beta, the model should allow recovery if the data has enough variation in token contributions and splits.\n\nVariables in the model:\n- alpha: learnable, [0,1]\n- beta: learnable, [-10,10]\n- gamma: learnable, [-5,5]\n- token_self: from data\n- combined_earning: from data\n- split_self: from data\n\nThe model equation is:\n\nutility = beta * (split_self - (alpha * 3 * token_self + (1 - alpha) * 0.5 * combined_earning)) + gamma\n\nThis utility is then passed through a logistic function to get the probability of accepting. The target variable is 'accept', a binary outcome.\n\nI need to ensure all variables used are present in the dataset. The dataset includes token_self, combined_earning, split_self, so this is feasible. Trial_role is used to filter responder trials, but the model itself doesn't need trial_role as a variable since it's only predicting for responders.\n\nThis setup should meet the requirements: uses relevant variables, has learnable parameters with bounds, and the utility is unbounded, which when passed through logistic will give the probability. The parameters alpha, beta, gamma are all within finite bounds, aiding in recovery.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nutility = beta * (split_self - (alpha * 3 * token_self + (1 - alpha) * 0.5 * combined_earning)) + gamma\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weighting between equity (token-based fairness) and equality (50/50 split) norms\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to deviations from fairness reference\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"gamma\": {\n      \"description\": \"Baseline bias toward accepting/rejecting\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -5,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Participant's token contribution (raw data)\",\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total pot size in \u00a3 (3*(token_self + token_opp))\",\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed \u00a3 amount for participant\",\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>accept</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA fairness-based utility model where responders evaluate offers against a weighted combination of equity (proportional to contributions) and equality (50/50 split) norms.
