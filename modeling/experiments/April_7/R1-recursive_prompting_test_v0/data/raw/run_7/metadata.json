  "instructions": "<think>\nOkay, let's look at the previous run results. The average BIC was 33.60, which is okay but could be lower. The accuracy was around 0.795, which is decent but there's room for improvement. The parameter recovery for alpha was really good (r=0.904), but beta was low (0.388) and gamma was moderate (0.681). So the main issues are beta's recovery and possibly the model's complexity affecting BIC.\n\nThe previous instructions suggested decoupling magnitude and direction sensitivity, using dynamic fairness weighting, and diminishing sensitivity. The model likely had parameters alpha, beta, theta. But beta's recovery was poor. Maybe the model structure is causing beta and theta to be confounded. For example, if beta is scaling the magnitude and theta is a penalty for negative deviations, there might be collinearity if the data doesn't have enough variation in positive vs negative deviations.\n\nTo improve beta's recovery, perhaps make the model's components more orthogonal. For instance, use separate parameters for positive and negative deviations. But with three parameters, maybe split beta into beta_plus and beta_minus, and drop theta. However, that would require a fourth parameter. Alternatively, use a single beta for magnitude and theta as a directional multiplier, not just a penalty. For example, U = beta * |deviation| + theta * deviation. This way, theta scales linearly with the deviation's sign, allowing for asymmetric sensitivity. This might help in distinguishing beta and theta's effects.\n\nAnother angle: The dynamic weighting of alpha using token_self/(token_self + token_opp) might not be the best approach. Maybe instead, use a sigmoid function to make alpha depend on the contribution ratio. For example, alpha_effective = sigmoid(alpha * (token_self - token_opp)). This introduces a nonlinear relationship, which could better capture how participants adjust their fairness expectations based on contribution differences. However, this would still use alpha as a learnable parameter without adding new ones.\n\nAlso, the diminishing sensitivity via log(1 + |deviation|) might not be the best transformation. Maybe use a power function with an exponent parameter. But that adds another parameter. Alternatively, use sqrt(|deviation|) which is a common way to model diminishing returns. This could help in better capturing the nonlinear utility perception without extra parameters.\n\nAdditionally, the previous model might not account for the total combined earning's effect beyond the 50% split. Perhaps participants have a different equality reference, like a fixed amount instead of a percentage. But integrating that would require more parameters. Alternatively, let the equality term be a parameter, but that's beyond the three-parameter limit.\n\nTo address beta's poor recovery, maybe introduce a non-linear interaction between beta and the deviation's direction. For example, U = beta * |deviation| * (1 + theta * (deviation < 0)). Here, theta scales the sensitivity for negative deviations, allowing beta to represent the base sensitivity and theta the multiplicative penalty. This could disentangle their effects.\n\nAnother idea: Include an interaction term between alpha and the deviation. For example, U = beta * |deviation| + theta * (deviation < 0) + gamma * alpha * deviation. This introduces a new parameter gamma, but we need to stay within three. So maybe replace theta with a term that combines direction and alpha's effect.\n\nAlternatively, model the utility as a piecewise linear function with different slopes for positive and negative deviations. For example, U = beta_plus * max(deviation, 0) + beta_minus * min(deviation, 0) + gamma. But this requires two beta parameters. To fit within three parameters, replace gamma with beta_minus, making it U = beta_plus * max(deviation, 0) + beta_minus * min(deviation, 0). But then we lose the baseline bias. Hmm.\n\nWait, the previous model used theta as a penalty for negative deviations. If beta is the magnitude sensitivity and theta is the directional penalty, perhaps the model is U = beta * |deviation| + theta * (deviation < 0). But this might not capture the varying degrees of negative deviations. A continuous interaction might be better, like U = beta * deviation + theta * (deviation < 0) * |deviation|. This way, theta scales the impact of negative deviations proportionally. But this complicates the model.\n\nAlternatively, use a rectified linear model: U = beta * deviation + theta * min(deviation, 0). This allows beta to capture the linear effect of deviation, and theta adds an extra penalty when the deviation is negative. This could help in separating the effects of beta and theta.\n\nIn summary, the key adjustments for the next run should focus on:\n\n1. Improving parameter identifiability by restructuring the model to reduce collinearity between beta and theta.\n2. Enhancing the dynamic weighting of alpha using a nonlinear function based on contribution ratios.\n3. Experimenting with different transformations for diminishing sensitivity, such as square root instead of log.\n4. Introducing asymmetric sensitivity to positive and negative deviations in a way that clearly separates the roles of beta and theta.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the model should achieve better parameter recovery (especially for beta and theta), lower BIC through improved fit, and higher accuracy by capturing more nuanced decision processes.\n</think>\n\n**Instructions for Run 7:**  \nDesign a model that **explicitly models asymmetric sensitivity to over/under-fair offers** while **nonlinearly anchoring fairness expectations to contribution ratios**.

Use these strategies:  \n\n1. **Dynamic \u03b1 Anchoring:**  \n   Replace static \u03b1 weighting with:  \n   `\u03b1_effective = \u03c3(\u03b8 * (token_self - token_opp))`  \n   where \u03c3 is the logistic function, tying fairness expectations *directly to contribution asymmetry* (\u03b8 \u2208 [-5,5]).  \n\n2. **Valence-Specific Utility:**  \n   Split utility into two orthogonal components:  \n   ```  \n   U = \u03b2_over * max(deviation,0) + \u03b2_under * min(deviation,0)  \n   ```  \n   where \u03b2_over \u2208 [0,10] controls sensitivity to generous offers and \u03b2_under \u2208 [-10,0] penalizes unfair offers.  \n\n3. **Prospect-Theoretic Transformation:**  \n   Apply concave utility for gains and convex utility for losses:  \n   ```  \n   U = sign(deviation) * (|deviation|^\u03b3)  \n   ```  \n   with \u03b3 \u2208 [0.3,1] capturing diminishing sensitivity to large deviations.  \n\n**Constraints:**  \n- Use exactly 3 parameters: \u03b8 (fairness anchoring), \u03b2_over (gain sensitivity), \u03b3 (curvature)  \n- No baseline bias terms to force identifiability  \n- Bounds: \u03b8 \u2208 [-5,5], \u03b2_over \u2208 [0,10], \u03b3 \u2208 [0.3,1]  \n\n**Goal:** Achieve \u03b2_over/\u03b2_under recovery r > 0.85 while keeping BIC < 32.

      "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The goal is to design a model that predicts whether a participant accepts or rejects a proposal, focusing on responder behavior. The model needs to use the given variables appropriately, pass parameter recovery tests, and predict utility such that less than 0 utility corresponds to less than 50% acceptance probability.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which variables are relevant. The target is 'accept', so the model should predict this based on other variables. Since we're focusing on responder behavior, we should consider trials where the participant is the responder (trial_role = 1). The key variables here might be the proposed splits (split_self, split_opp), the tokens found (token_self, token_opp), and the combined earnings.\n\nThe challenge is to model the utility a responder derives from a proposal. The utility should account for fairness relative to contributions. Since the combined earnings vary, equal split percentages don't mean the same fairness. So, the model needs to compare the proposed split to what's considered fair based on contributions.\n\nOne approach is to calculate a fairness reference point. For example, a fair split might be proportional to the participant's contribution. The participant's contribution is token_self, and the opponent's is token_opp. The total contribution is token_self + token_opp, so the fair share for the participant would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\n\nThe deviation from this fair share could be split_self - fair_share. If the proposed split_self is higher than the fair share, it's advantageous; if lower, it's disadvantageous. The utility function could then be based on this deviation, with parameters accounting for sensitivity to gains and losses.\n\nTo incorporate diminishing sensitivity, we might apply a nonlinear transformation to the deviation, like a logarithm or power function. For example, using a parameter \u03b1 to scale the linear effect and another parameter \u03b2 to capture diminishing returns: U = \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share) - \u03b2 * (split_self - fair_share)^2. However, this might not capture loss aversion.\n\nAlternatively, prospect theory suggests people are more sensitive to losses than gains. So, we could model positive and negative deviations differently. Let\u2019s define deviation as split_self - fair_share. Then, U = \u03b8 * (split_self - fair_share) if deviation >=0, else U = \u03bb * \u03b8 * (split_self - fair_share), where \u03bb >1 captures loss aversion. But this requires a piecewise function.\n\nAnother consideration is the weight given to the fairness reference. Participants might not strictly follow contribution-based fairness. A parameter could adjust how much they weight their own contribution versus the opponent's. For example, a parameter \u03b3 that scales the fair share calculation: fair_share_adjusted = ( (token_self + \u03b3 * token_opp) / (token_self + token_opp) ) * combined_earning. If \u03b3=1, it's the same as before. If \u03b3 <1, the participant undervalues the opponent's contribution.\n\nPutting this together, the utility function could be:\n\nU = \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share_adjusted) + \u03b2 * (split_self - fair_share_adjusted)^2\n\nBut this might not capture the asymmetric treatment of gains and losses. Alternatively, using a piecewise linear function with different coefficients for positive and negative deviations:\n\ndeviation = split_self - fair_share_adjusted\nU = if deviation >=0: \u03b1 * deviation else: \u03bb * \u03b1 * deviation\n\nHere, \u03b1 is sensitivity to deviations, and \u03bb >1 would mean stronger reaction to losses. However, \u03bb needs to be constrained to positive values.\n\nTo ensure the model can be estimated with the data, all parameters must have finite bounds. For example, \u03b1 could be in [0, 10], \u03bb in [1, 5], and \u03b3 in [0, 2].\n\nThe probability of accepting is then a logistic function of U: P(accept=1) = 1 / (1 + exp(-U)). If U <0, the probability is below 0.5.\n\nNow, translating this into a mathematical model:\n\nLet\u2019s define fair_share_adjusted as:\n\nfair_share_adjusted = (token_self + \u03b3 * token_opp) / (token_self + token_opp) * combined_earning\n\nThen, deviation = split_self - fair_share_adjusted\n\nUtility U is:\n\nU = \u03b1 * deviation - \u03b2 * (deviation < 0) * |deviation|\n\nHere, \u03b1 is the sensitivity to the deviation, and \u03b2 is an additional penalty when the deviation is negative (loss aversion). This way, negative deviations (unfair offers) reduce utility more steeply.\n\nAlternatively, using separate coefficients for positive and negative deviations:\n\nU = \u03b1_plus * max(deviation, 0) + alpha_minus * min(deviation, 0)\n\nBut this introduces two parameters. To keep it within the problem's constraints, maybe combine them with a single parameter for loss aversion.\n\nAnother approach is to use a linear function with a penalty for negative deviations:\n\nU = alpha * deviation + theta * (deviation < 0)\n\nHere, theta is the penalty when the offer is below the fair share. However, this might not scale with the magnitude of the deviation.\n\nConsidering parameter recovery, it's better to have parameters that are orthogonal. So, combining a linear term with a penalty that scales with the deviation's magnitude when negative:\n\nU = alpha * deviation + theta * min(deviation, 0)\n\nThis way, theta scales the impact of negative deviations. If theta is negative, it adds a penalty.\n\nPutting it all together, the model would be:\n\nfair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\ndeviation = split_self - fair_share\nU = alpha * deviation + theta * (deviation < 0) * |deviation|\n\nHere, alpha is the general sensitivity, and theta is the additional sensitivity to negative deviations. If theta is positive, it amplifies the negative impact.\n\nAlternatively, using a nonlinear transformation for diminishing sensitivity:\n\nU = alpha * sign(deviation) * log(1 + |deviation|) + theta * (deviation < 0)\n\nBut log might not be the best choice. Maybe a power function:\n\nU = alpha * (deviation) - beta * (deviation < 0) * |deviation|^gamma\n\nThis introduces more parameters, but the problem allows for learnable parameters with bounds.\n\nConsidering the need for parameter recovery, the model should have parameters that are identifiable. A simpler model might be better. Let's try:\n\nU = alpha * (split_self / combined_earning - fair_perc) + beta * (split_self / combined_earning - fair_perc)^2\n\nWhere fair_perc is token_self / (token_self + token_opp). This models utility as a quadratic function of the percentage deviation from the fair split. However, this might not capture loss aversion.\n\nAlternatively, using the fair percentage directly:\n\nfair_perc = token_self / (token_self + token_opp)\ndeviation_perc = splitperc_self - fair_perc * 100\nU = alpha * deviation_perc + beta * (deviation_perc < 0) * |deviation_perc|\n\nHere, alpha is sensitivity to percentage deviation, and beta is the additional penalty for negative deviations.\n\nBut the problem states that splitperc_self is available, so perhaps using that directly. However, the fair percentage is based on contributions, so it's better to compute it from token_self and token_opp.\n\nIncluding all variables, the final model could be:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * (split_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) + theta * (split_self < (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) * |split_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning|\n</MODEL>\n\nHere, alpha is the sensitivity to the deviation from the fair share, and theta is an additional penalty when the offer is below the fair share. This way, negative deviations (unfair offers) have a stronger effect.\n\nThe variables would be:\n\n- alpha: learnable parameter, sensitivity to deviation, range [-10, 10]\n- theta: learnable parameter, penalty for unfair offers, range [0, 10]\n- split_self: from data\n- token_self: from data\n- token_opp: from data\n- combined_earning: from data\n\nThe utility U is calculated, and the probability of acceptance is logistic(U). If U < 0, the probability is below 0.5.\n\nThis model uses only the necessary variables and has two learnable parameters with reasonable bounds. Theta is constrained to be non-negative to ensure it acts as a penalty when the offer is unfair.\n\nTesting this model should allow for parameter recovery and accurate predictions. The quadratic term in the previous example was dropped to keep the model linear in parameters, aiding identifiability.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * (split_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) + theta * (split_self < (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) * |split_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning|\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Linear sensitivity to deviation from contribution-weighted fair share\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"theta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Additional penalty coefficient for offers below fair share\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed \u00a3 amount for participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Participant's token count\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Opponent's token count\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total \u00a3 in shared pot\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>accept</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA prospect-theoretic utility model where responders evaluate offers relative to a contribution-based fairness reference.

The model needs to use the given variables appropriately, pass parameter recovery tests, and predict utility such that less than 0 utility corresponds to less than 50% acceptance probability.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which variables are relevant. The target is 'accept', so the model should predict this based on other variables. Since we're focusing on responder behavior, we should consider trials where the participant is the responder (trial_role = 1). The key variables here might be the proposed splits (split_self, split_opp), the tokens found (token_self, token_opp), and the combined earnings.\n\nThe challenge is to model the utility a responder derives from a proposal. The utility should account for fairness relative to contributions. Since the combined earnings vary, equal split percentages don't mean the same fairness. So, the model needs to compare the proposed split to what's considered fair based on contributions.\n\nOne approach is to calculate a fairness reference point. For example, a fair split might be proportional to the participant's contribution. The participant's contribution is token_self, and the opponent's is token_opp. The total contribution is token_self + token_opp, so the fair share for the participant would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\n\nThe deviation from this fair share could be split_self - fair_share. If the proposed split_self is higher than the fair share, it's advantageous; if lower, it's disadvantageous. The utility function could then be based on this deviation, with parameters accounting for sensitivity to gains and losses.\n\nTo incorporate diminishing sensitivity, we might apply a nonlinear transformation to the deviation, like a logarithm or power function. For example, using a parameter \u03b1 to scale the linear effect and another parameter \u03b2 to capture diminishing returns: U = \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share) - \u03b2 * (split_self - fair_share)^2. However, this might not capture loss aversion.\n\nAlternatively, prospect theory suggests people are more sensitive to losses than gains. So, we could model positive and negative deviations differently. Let\u2019s define deviation as split_self - fair_share. Then, U = \u03b8 * (split_self - fair_share) if deviation >=0, else U = \u03bb * \u03b8 * (split_self - fair_share), where \u03bb >1 captures loss aversion. But this requires a piecewise function.\n\nAnother consideration is the weight given to the fairness reference. Participants might not strictly follow contribution-based fairness. A parameter could adjust how much they weight their own contribution versus the opponent's. For example, a parameter \u03b3 that scales the fair share calculation: fair_share_adjusted = ( (token_self + \u03b3 * token_opp) / (token_self + token_opp) ) * combined_earning. If \u03b3=1, it's the same as before. If \u03b3 <1, the participant undervalues the opponent's contribution.\n\nPutting this together, the utility function could be:\n\nU = \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share_adjusted) + \u03b2 * (split_self - fair_share_adjusted)^2\n\nBut this might not capture the asymmetric treatment of gains and losses. Alternatively, using a piecewise linear function with different coefficients for positive and negative deviations:\n\ndeviation = split_self - fair_share_adjusted\nU = if deviation >=0: \u03b1 * deviation else: \u03bb * \u03b1 * deviation\n\nHere, \u03b1 is sensitivity to deviations, and \u03bb >1 would mean stronger reaction to losses. However, \u03bb needs to be constrained to positive values.\n\nTo ensure the model can be estimated with the data, all parameters must have finite bounds. For example, \u03b1 could be in [0, 10], \u03bb in [1, 5], and \u03b3 in [0, 2].\n\nThe probability of accepting is then a logistic function of U: P(accept=1) = 1 / (1 + exp(-U)). If U <0, the probability is below 0.5.\n\nNow, translating this into a mathematical model:\n\nLet\u2019s define fair_share_adjusted as:\n\nfair_share_adjusted = (token_self + \u03b3 * token_opp) / (token_self + token_opp) * combined_earning\n\nThen, deviation = split_self - fair_share_adjusted\n\nUtility U is:\n\nU = \u03b1 * deviation - \u03b2 * (deviation < 0) * |deviation|\n\nHere, \u03b1 is the sensitivity to the deviation, and \u03b2 is an additional penalty when the deviation is negative (loss aversion). This way, negative deviations (unfair offers) reduce utility more steeply.\n\nAlternatively, using separate coefficients for positive and negative deviations:\n\nU = \u03b1_plus * max(deviation, 0) + alpha_minus * min(deviation, 0)\n\nBut this introduces two parameters. To keep it within the problem's constraints, maybe combine them with a single parameter for loss aversion.\n\nAnother approach is to use a linear function with a penalty for negative deviations:\n\nU = alpha * deviation + theta * (deviation < 0)\n\nHere, theta is the penalty when the offer is below the fair share. However, this might not scale with the magnitude of the deviation.\n\nConsidering parameter recovery, it's better to have parameters that are orthogonal. So, combining a linear term with a penalty that scales with the deviation's magnitude when negative:\n\nU = alpha * deviation + theta * min(deviation, 0)\n\nThis way, theta scales the impact of negative deviations. If theta is negative, it adds a penalty.\n\nPutting it all together, the model would be:\n\nfair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\ndeviation = split_self - fair_share\nU = alpha * deviation + theta * (deviation < 0) * |deviation|\n\nHere, alpha is the general sensitivity, and theta is the additional sensitivity to negative deviations. If theta is positive, it amplifies the negative impact.\n\nAlternatively, using a nonlinear transformation for diminishing sensitivity:\n\nU = alpha * sign(deviation) * log(1 + |deviation|) + theta * (deviation < 0)\n\nBut log might not be the best choice. Maybe a power function:\n\nU = alpha * (deviation) - beta * (deviation < 0) * |deviation|^gamma\n\nThis introduces more parameters, but the problem allows for learnable parameters with bounds.\n\nConsidering the need for parameter recovery, the model should have parameters that are identifiable. A simpler model might be better. Let's try:\n\nU = alpha * (split_self / combined_earning - fair_perc) + beta * (split_self / combined_earning - fair_perc)^2\n\nWhere fair_perc is token_self / (token_self + token_opp). This models utility as a quadratic function of the percentage deviation from the fair split. However, this might not capture loss aversion.\n\nAlternatively, using the fair percentage directly:\n\nfair_perc = token_self / (token_self + token_opp)\ndeviation_perc = splitperc_self - fair_perc * 100\nU = alpha * deviation_perc + beta * (deviation_perc < 0) * |deviation_perc|\n\nHere, alpha is sensitivity to percentage deviation, and beta is the additional penalty for negative deviations.\n\nBut the problem states that splitperc_self is available, so perhaps using that directly. However, the fair percentage is based on contributions, so it's better to compute it from token_self and token_opp.\n\nIncluding all variables, the final model could be:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * (split_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) + theta * (split_self < (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) * |split_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning|\n</MODEL>\n\nHere, alpha is the sensitivity to the deviation from the fair share, and theta is an additional penalty when the offer is below the fair share. This way, negative deviations (unfair offers) have a stronger effect.\n\nThe variables would be:\n\n- alpha: learnable parameter, sensitivity to deviation, range [-10, 10]\n- theta: learnable parameter, penalty for unfair offers, range [0, 10]\n- split_self: from data\n- token_self: from data\n- token_opp: from data\n- combined_earning: from data\n\nThe utility U is calculated, and the probability of acceptance is logistic(U). If U < 0, the probability is below 0.5.\n\nThis model uses only the necessary variables and has two learnable parameters with reasonable bounds. Theta is constrained to be non-negative to ensure it acts as a penalty when the offer is unfair.\n\nTesting this model should allow for parameter recovery and accurate predictions. The quadratic term in the previous example was dropped to keep the model linear in parameters, aiding identifiability.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * (split_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) + theta * (split_self < (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) * |split_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning|\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Linear sensitivity to deviation from contribution-weighted fair share\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"theta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Additional penalty coefficient for offers below fair share\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed \u00a3 amount for participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Participant's token count\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Opponent's token count\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total \u00a3 in shared pot\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>accept</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA prospect-theoretic utility model where responders evaluate offers relative to a contribution-based fairness reference.

Utility has two components: 1) linear sensitivity (alpha) to absolute deviation from expected fair share, and 2) an additional penalty (theta) for disadvantageous inequality. The fair share is dynamically calculated as (self_tokens / total_tokens) * combined_earning.\nTarget Variable: accept\nPrediction Type: utility\nBIC: 41.35528479843423\nOverall Accuracy: 0.6749\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.750\n- theta: r = 0.648"
