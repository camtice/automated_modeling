Okay, let's look at the previous run. The model had a BIC of 36.07, which is better than some earlier models but still room for improvement. The accuracy was around 0.79, which is decent but could be higher. The parameter recovery for alpha was great (0.955), theta was okay (0.684), and beta was lower (0.378). So beta's recovery is a problem.

The previous instructions suggested a model with lambda, beta_gain, beta_loss, and gamma_gain, fixing gamma_loss as 2 - gamma_gain. But maybe the fixed relationship between gamma_gain and gamma_loss is limiting. For example, if gamma_gain is 0.3, gamma_loss would be 1.7, which is still convex. But maybe allowing them to vary independently could capture more nuanced behavior, even if it adds a parameter. However, that increases model complexity, which affects BIC. But the previous run had three parameters (alpha, theta, beta) and now we have four. Wait, the previous run's model had alpha, theta, beta, but the new instructions for run 8 suggested four parameters. However, the results here are from run 7, which had alpha, theta, beta. So maybe the next step is to address the beta parameter's poor recovery.

The beta parameter in the previous model was a baseline acceptance tendency. If it's not recovering well, perhaps it's collinear with other parameters. For example, if the model includes both a baseline beta and a sensitivity alpha, there might be trade-offs between them during fitting. To improve identifiability, maybe remove the baseline term (beta) and let the model rely solely on the deviation from fairness. Alternatively, structure the model so that parameters are orthogonal.

Another angle: The previous model used a linear combination of deviation from fair share plus a baseline. Maybe the baseline is not necessary, and removing it (beta) would reduce parameters and improve recovery. Alternatively, make the baseline a function of other variables, like trial type or group, but that requires more data.

Looking at the parameter recovery, theta (0.684) and beta (0.378) are lower. Theta controls the weighting of own contribution in the fairness calculation. Maybe the model's fairness threshold isn't capturing the right dynamics. For example, participants might have different fairness norms depending on whether they contributed more or less than the opponent. Introducing a trial_type-dependent lambda could help. For instance, if trial_type is 1 (equal), 2 (opponent more), or 3 (participant more), lambda could vary accordingly. But this adds more parameters, which might not be ideal.

Alternatively, use a nonlinear function for lambda based on the token difference. For example, lambda = theta * (token_self - token_opp)/(token_self + token_opp) + 1. This way, when the participant contributes more, lambda decreases, increasing their fair share. But this introduces theta as a learnable parameter scaling the token difference effect.

Another idea: Incorporate a sigmoid function to smoothly transition between contribution-based and equal split fairness. For example, lambda = 1 + theta * (token_self - token_opp)/(token_self + token_opp). But this requires careful bounding of theta to keep lambda within [0,2].

To address beta's poor recovery, perhaps remove it. The utility becomes U = alpha * deviation, with no baseline. This reduces parameters and might improve identifiability. Alternatively, tie beta to another parameter, like beta = gamma * alpha, but that's speculative.

The previous instructions for run 8 suggested separating gain and loss curvature. The current model (run 7) didn't do that, so moving to a prospect-theoretic model with separate gain and loss parameters could help. For example, if participants are more sensitive to losses (getting less than fair), the model could have different sensitivities for positive and negative deviations.

So, the new model could be:

U = beta_gain * (max(deviation, 0))^gamma_gain + beta_loss * (min(deviation, 0))^gamma_loss

Where deviation = split_self - fair_share, and fair_share is calculated with a lambda parameter.

This introduces four parameters: lambda, beta_gain, beta_loss, gamma_gain, gamma_loss. But to keep it to four, maybe fix gamma_loss = 2 - gamma_gain as before. Then the parameters are lambda, beta_gain, beta_loss, gamma_gain.

Additionally, to enforce identifiability, set beta_gain >=0 and beta_loss <=0, so they can't cancel each other out. This separation might improve parameter recovery as each parameter affects a distinct part of the utility function.

Another consideration: The fairness calculation. The previous model used theta to weight own contribution. Maybe a better approach is to let lambda represent the weight on the opponent's contribution. For example:

fair_share = (token_self + lambda * token_opp) / (token_self + token_opp) * combined_earning

Here, lambda=1 means contributions are weighted equally, lambda=0 means only self's contribution matters. This is similar to the previous approach but more interpretable.

Putting it all together, the new instructions should guide towards a model with:

1. A fairness reference based on a weighted sum of contributions (lambda).
2. Separate gain and loss terms with power functions.
3. Constraints on parameters to ensure identifiability.
4. Removal of the baseline beta parameter to reduce collinearity.

This should improve parameter recovery (especially for the sensitivity parameters) and potentially lower BIC by better capturing the underlying decision process.

**Instructions for Run 9:**  
Design a model that **radically redefines fairness perception through opponent contribution mirroring** while **introducing asymmetric power laws for gain/loss domains**. Implement these counterintuitive features:  

1. **Reciprocal Fairness Threshold:**  
   Compute fairness as:  
   `fair_share = ( (1 + λ) * token_self ) / ( (1 + λ) * token_self + token_opp ) * combined_earning`  
   where λ ∈ [-0.5,1] controls *strategic discounting* of opponent contributions (λ < 0 → adversarial weighting, λ > 0 → cooperative weighting).  

2. **Biophysical Utility Scaling:**  
   ```  
   U = β * [ (max(deviation,0))^{γ} / (1 + κ*gain_context) - |min(deviation,0)|^{1.5-γ} ]  
   ```  
   - γ ∈ [0.2,0.8] controls *neural diminishing returns* for gains  
   - κ ∈ [0,2] scales *post-reward satiation* using `gain_context = max(0, split_self - historical_mean)`  
   - β ∈ [0.1,5] as overall scaling  

3. **Dynamic Anchoring:**  
   Compute `historical_mean` as exponentially weighted average:  
   `historical_mean_t = ρ * split_self_{t-1} + (1-ρ) * historical_mean_{t-1}`  
   with ρ ∈ [0.01,0.3] constraining memory persistence  

**Key Innovations:**  
- λ < 0 allows modeling *spiteful utility* where opponents' contributions actively reduce perceived fairness  
- κ creates trial-by-trial habituation to generous offers  
- 1.5-γ in loss exponent forces anti-symmetry with gain curvature  

**Validation Targets:**  
- Achieve λ-γ parameter recovery r > 0.85 while keeping BIC < 34  
- Test if κ > 0.5 predicts lower rejection rates for sequential generous offers  
- Use exactly 5 parameters: λ, β, γ, κ, ρ  

**Provocation:** What if participants compute fairness relative to *what they could have stolen* rather than earned? Explore implicit power dynamics through λ < 0 edge cases.
