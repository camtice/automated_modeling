  "instructions": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's look at the previous run. The model had a BIC of 36.07, which is better than some earlier models but still room for improvement. The accuracy was around 0.79, which is decent but could be higher. The parameter recovery for alpha was great (0.955), theta was okay (0.684), and beta was lower (0.378). So beta's recovery is a problem.\n\nThe previous instructions suggested a model with lambda, beta_gain, beta_loss, and gamma_gain, fixing gamma_loss as 2 - gamma_gain. But maybe the fixed relationship between gamma_gain and gamma_loss is limiting. For example, if gamma_gain is 0.3, gamma_loss would be 1.7, which is still convex. But maybe allowing them to vary independently could capture more nuanced behavior, even if it adds a parameter. However, that increases model complexity, which affects BIC. But the previous run had three parameters (alpha, theta, beta) and now we have four. Wait, the previous run's model had alpha, theta, beta, but the new instructions for run 8 suggested four parameters. However, the results here are from run 7, which had alpha, theta, beta. So maybe the next step is to address the beta parameter's poor recovery.\n\nThe beta parameter in the previous model was a baseline acceptance tendency. If it's not recovering well, perhaps it's collinear with other parameters. For example, if the model includes both a baseline beta and a sensitivity alpha, there might be trade-offs between them during fitting. To improve identifiability, maybe remove the baseline term (beta) and let the model rely solely on the deviation from fairness. Alternatively, structure the model so that parameters are orthogonal.\n\nAnother angle: The previous model used a linear combination of deviation from fair share plus a baseline. Maybe the baseline is not necessary, and removing it (beta) would reduce parameters and improve recovery. Alternatively, make the baseline a function of other variables, like trial type or group, but that requires more data.\n\nLooking at the parameter recovery, theta (0.684) and beta (0.378) are lower. Theta controls the weighting of own contribution in the fairness calculation. Maybe the model's fairness threshold isn't capturing the right dynamics. For example, participants might have different fairness norms depending on whether they contributed more or less than the opponent. Introducing a trial_type-dependent lambda could help. For instance, if trial_type is 1 (equal), 2 (opponent more), or 3 (participant more), lambda could vary accordingly. But this adds more parameters, which might not be ideal.\n\nAlternatively, use a nonlinear function for lambda based on the token difference. For example, lambda = theta * (token_self - token_opp)/(token_self + token_opp) + 1. This way, when the participant contributes more, lambda decreases, increasing their fair share. But this introduces theta as a learnable parameter scaling the token difference effect.\n\nAnother idea: Incorporate a sigmoid function to smoothly transition between contribution-based and equal split fairness. For example, lambda = 1 + theta * (token_self - token_opp)/(token_self + token_opp). But this requires careful bounding of theta to keep lambda within [0,2].\n\nTo address beta's poor recovery, perhaps remove it. The utility becomes U = alpha * deviation, with no baseline. This reduces parameters and might improve identifiability. Alternatively, tie beta to another parameter, like beta = gamma * alpha, but that's speculative.\n\nThe previous instructions for run 8 suggested separating gain and loss curvature. The current model (run 7) didn't do that, so moving to a prospect-theoretic model with separate gain and loss parameters could help. For example, if participants are more sensitive to losses (getting less than fair), the model could have different sensitivities for positive and negative deviations.\n\nSo, the new model could be:\n\nU = beta_gain * (max(deviation, 0))^gamma_gain + beta_loss * (min(deviation, 0))^gamma_loss\n\nWhere deviation = split_self - fair_share, and fair_share is calculated with a lambda parameter.\n\nThis introduces four parameters: lambda, beta_gain, beta_loss, gamma_gain, gamma_loss. But to keep it to four, maybe fix gamma_loss = 2 - gamma_gain as before. Then the parameters are lambda, beta_gain, beta_loss, gamma_gain.\n\nAdditionally, to enforce identifiability, set beta_gain >=0 and beta_loss <=0, so they can't cancel each other out. This separation might improve parameter recovery as each parameter affects a distinct part of the utility function.\n\nAnother consideration: The fairness calculation. The previous model used theta to weight own contribution. Maybe a better approach is to let lambda represent the weight on the opponent's contribution. For example:\n\nfair_share = (token_self + lambda * token_opp) / (token_self + token_opp) * combined_earning\n\nHere, lambda=1 means contributions are weighted equally, lambda=0 means only self's contribution matters. This is similar to the previous approach but more interpretable.\n\nPutting it all together, the new instructions should guide towards a model with:\n\n1. A fairness reference based on a weighted sum of contributions (lambda).\n2. Separate gain and loss terms with power functions.\n3. Constraints on parameters to ensure identifiability.\n4. Removal of the baseline beta parameter to reduce collinearity.\n\nThis should improve parameter recovery (especially for the sensitivity parameters) and potentially lower BIC by better capturing the underlying decision process.\n</think>\n\n**Instructions for Run 9:**  \nDesign a model that **radically redefines fairness perception through opponent contribution mirroring** while **introducing asymmetric power laws for gain/loss domains**. Implement these counterintuitive features:  \n\n1. **Reciprocal Fairness Threshold:**  \n   Compute fairness as:  \n   `fair_share = ( (1 + \u03bb) * token_self ) / ( (1 + \u03bb) * token_self + token_opp ) * combined_earning`  \n   where \u03bb \u2208 [-0.5,1] controls *strategic discounting* of opponent contributions (\u03bb < 0 \u2192 adversarial weighting, \u03bb > 0 \u2192 cooperative weighting).  \n\n2. **Biophysical Utility Scaling:**  \n   ```  \n   U = \u03b2 * [ (max(deviation,0))^{\u03b3} / (1 + \u03ba*gain_context) - |min(deviation,0)|^{1.5-\u03b3} ]  \n   ```  \n   - \u03b3 \u2208 [0.2,0.8] controls *neural diminishing returns* for gains  \n   - \u03ba \u2208 [0,2] scales *post-reward satiation* using `gain_context = max(0, split_self - historical_mean)`  \n   - \u03b2 \u2208 [0.1,5] as overall scaling  \n\n3. **Dynamic Anchoring:**  \n   Compute `historical_mean` as exponentially weighted average:  \n   `historical_mean_t = \u03c1 * split_self_{t-1} + (1-\u03c1) * historical_mean_{t-1}`  \n   with \u03c1 \u2208 [0.01,0.3] constraining memory persistence  \n\n**Key Innovations:**  \n- \u03bb < 0 allows modeling *spiteful utility* where opponents' contributions actively reduce perceived fairness  \n- \u03ba creates trial-by-trial habituation to generous offers  \n- 1.5-\u03b3 in loss exponent forces anti-symmetry with gain curvature  \n\n**Validation Targets:**  \n- Achieve \u03bb-\u03b3 parameter recovery r > 0.85 while keeping BIC < 34  \n- Test if \u03ba > 0.5 predicts lower rejection rates for sequential generous offers  \n- Use exactly 5 parameters: \u03bb, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03ba, \u03c1  \n\n**Provocation:** What if participants compute fairness relative to *what they could have stolen* rather than earned?

Removal of the baseline beta parameter to reduce collinearity.\n\nThis should improve parameter recovery (especially for the sensitivity parameters) and potentially lower BIC by better capturing the underlying decision process.\n</think>\n\n**Instructions for Run 9:**  \nDesign a model that **radically redefines fairness perception through opponent contribution mirroring** while **introducing asymmetric power laws for gain/loss domains**. Implement these counterintuitive features:  \n\n1. **Reciprocal Fairness Threshold:**  \n   Compute fairness as:  \n   `fair_share = ( (1 + \u03bb) * token_self ) / ( (1 + \u03bb) * token_self + token_opp ) * combined_earning`  \n   where \u03bb \u2208 [-0.5,1] controls *strategic discounting* of opponent contributions (\u03bb < 0 \u2192 adversarial weighting, \u03bb > 0 \u2192 cooperative weighting).  \n\n2. **Biophysical Utility Scaling:**  \n   ```  \n   U = \u03b2 * [ (max(deviation,0))^{\u03b3} / (1 + \u03ba*gain_context) - |min(deviation,0)|^{1.5-\u03b3} ]  \n   ```  \n   - \u03b3 \u2208 [0.2,0.8] controls *neural diminishing returns* for gains  \n   - \u03ba \u2208 [0,2] scales *post-reward satiation* using `gain_context = max(0, split_self - historical_mean)`  \n   - \u03b2 \u2208 [0.1,5] as overall scaling  \n\n3. **Dynamic Anchoring:**  \n   Compute `historical_mean` as exponentially weighted average:  \n   `historical_mean_t = \u03c1 * split_self_{t-1} + (1-\u03c1) * historical_mean_{t-1}`  \n   with \u03c1 \u2208 [0.01,0.3] constraining memory persistence  \n\n**Key Innovations:**  \n- \u03bb < 0 allows modeling *spiteful utility* where opponents' contributions actively reduce perceived fairness  \n- \u03ba creates trial-by-trial habituation to generous offers  \n- 1.5-\u03b3 in loss exponent forces anti-symmetry with gain curvature  \n\n**Validation Targets:**  \n- Achieve \u03bb-\u03b3 parameter recovery r > 0.85 while keeping BIC < 34  \n- Test if \u03ba > 0.5 predicts lower rejection rates for sequential generous offers  \n- Use exactly 5 parameters: \u03bb, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03ba, \u03c1  \n\n**Provocation:** What if participants compute fairness relative to *what they could have stolen* rather than earned? Explore implicit power dynamics through \u03bb < 0 edge cases.\n\nPrevious Models:Not Provided\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions.",
      "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts whether a participant (as the responder) accepts or rejects a proposal. The model needs to focus on responder behavior, use the given variables appropriately, and ensure parameter recovery is possible.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which variables are relevant for the responder's decision. The target variable is \"accept\", which is binary (1 or 0). The model should predict the utility of accepting, which will then be converted to a probability via a logistic function.\n\nKey variables provided include token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, split_self, split_opp, and trial_type. Since the task involves fairness considerations, the model should incorporate some notion of a fair share based on contributions (tokens found by self and opponent).\n\nThe challenge is to define a utility function that captures the responder's perception of fairness. The fair share could be calculated based on the participant's and opponent's contributions. For example, if the combined_earning is the total pot, a fair split might be proportional to the tokens each contributed. However, the problem states that two equal split_self values don't represent the same fairness if the combined earnings differ, so the model must account for the actual contributions.\n\nLet me consider a model where the utility of accepting depends on the difference between the proposed split (split_self) and what's considered fair. The fair share could be calculated as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. The deviation from this fair share (split_self - fair_share) would then influence the utility. \n\nBut participants might have different sensitivities to gains and losses relative to their fair share. So maybe introducing parameters to weight these deviations. For example, a parameter \u03b1 (alpha) could scale the deviation, and another parameter \u03b2 (beta) could represent a baseline acceptance tendency. \n\nAdditionally, the model should include a term for the opponent's proposed split (split_opp), but since the responder's decision is about their own share, perhaps the opponent's split is less directly relevant. However, trial_type indicates whether the split is equal, opponent more, or participant more, which might affect the responder's perception. Maybe trial_type can modulate the fairness calculation, but since trial_type is categorical, it might be better to handle it through interaction terms or separate parameters.\n\nWait, the problem states that the model should predict responder behavior, so trial_role should be 1 (responder). The model should only consider trials where trial_role is 1. However, the dataset includes both roles, so the model will filter those trials during implementation.\n\nNow, considering parameter recovery, the model should have parameters that are identifiable. Let's outline possible parameters:\n\n1. \u03b1 (alpha): Sensitivity to the deviation from the fair share. This could be a learnable parameter with bounds, say between -5 and 5, allowing for positive or negative weighting.\n2. \u03b2 (beta): Baseline propensity to accept, regardless of the offer. Bounds could be -5 to 5.\n3. \u03b8 (theta): A parameter that adjusts the fair share calculation. For example, if participants consider their own contribution more important, the fair share could be (token_self + \u03b8 * token_opp) / (token_self + token_opp) * combined_earning. This \u03b8 would adjust how much the opponent's contribution is weighted. Bounds could be 0 to 2, where \u03b8=1 is equal weighting.\n\nThe utility function could then be:\n\nU = \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share) + \u03b2\n\nWhere fair_share is calculated using \u03b8. If U > 0, the participant is more likely to accept.\n\nBut to ensure that the utility translates to a probability via logistic function, the probability of accepting would be 1 / (1 + exp(-U)). The model's parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b8) would be learned to maximize the likelihood of the observed accept/reject decisions.\n\nNow, checking the variables:\n\n- token_self and token_opp are used to calculate fair_share.\n- split_self is compared to fair_share.\n- combined_earning is part of the fair_share calculation.\n- trial_type might influence \u03b8, but to keep the model simple, perhaps \u03b8 is a single parameter across all trial types. Alternatively, \u03b8 could vary by trial_type, but that would require more parameters. Since the dataset has 36 trials per participant, adding more parameters might complicate parameter recovery. So sticking to a single \u03b8.\n\nAnother consideration: The fair share could be a proportion of the combined_earning. For example, if the participant contributed 60% of the tokens, their fair share would be 60% of combined_earning. But \u03b8 could adjust this proportion. For instance, \u03b8 > 1 might mean the participant expects more than their proportional share, \u03b8 < 1 means they accept less.\n\nWait, the fair_share formula using \u03b8 could be:\n\nfair_share = (token_self / (token_self + \u03b8 * token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nIf \u03b8 = 1, it's proportional. If \u03b8 < 1, the opponent's tokens are discounted, leading to a higher fair share. If \u03b8 > 1, the opponent's tokens are overvalued, leading to a lower fair share. This might be a better way to parameterize the fairness perception.\n\nSo the utility becomes:\n\nU = \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share) + \u03b2\n\nWhere fair_share is calculated as above. This way, \u03b8 captures how much the participant values the opponent's contribution relative to their own.\n\nParameters:\n\n- \u03b1: Sensitivity to deviation from fair share. Bounds could be [-10, 10] to allow strong positive or negative effects.\n- \u03b2: Baseline acceptance. Bounds [-10, 10].\n- \u03b8: Weight on opponent's tokens. Bounds [0.1, 5], ensuring it's positive and non-zero.\n\nThis model uses three learnable parameters. The variables used are token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, split_self, and accept (as the target). Trial_role is used to filter responder trials.\n\nNow, ensuring that the model can be implemented with the given dataset. All required variables are present. The model doesn't use variables like split_opp or proposed_perc since those are relevant to the proposer role, which is excluded when trial_role=1.\n\nFor parameter recovery, each participant's 36 trials provide enough data to estimate three parameters. The model's simplicity aids in recovery, and the parameters have clear interpretations.\n\nThe utility function's output is unbounded, which aligns with the requirement. The probability of acceptance is logistic(U), so when U < 0, the probability is less than 0.5, meeting the fourth condition.\n\nFinally, the variable descriptions need to be clearly defined in JSON format, specifying each parameter's range, learnability, and source. The model's mathematical formula is enclosed in <MODEL> tags, and the target variable is accept.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * (split_self - (token_self / (token_self + theta * token_opp)) * combined_earning) + beta\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposal\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to deviation from fair share\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Baseline acceptance tendency\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"theta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weighting factor for opponent's contribution in fairness calculation\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.1,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Participant's own token contribution\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"data_min\",\n        \"max\": \"data_max\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Opponent's token contribution\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"data_min\",\n        \"max\": \"data_max\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"data_min\",\n        \"max\": \"data_max\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total money in shared pot\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"data_min\",\n        \"max\": \"data_max\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>accept</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA fairness-based utility model where acceptance probability depends on linear combination of deviation from contribution-weighted fair share and baseline tendency.

Logistic function converts utility to acceptance probability.",
  "target_variable": "accept",
  "full_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts whether a participant (as the responder) accepts or rejects a proposal. The model needs to focus on responder behavior, use the given variables appropriately, and ensure parameter recovery is possible.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which variables are relevant for the responder's decision. The target variable is \"accept\", which is binary (1 or 0). The model should predict the utility of accepting, which will then be converted to a probability via a logistic function.\n\nKey variables provided include token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, split_self, split_opp, and trial_type. Since the task involves fairness considerations, the model should incorporate some notion of a fair share based on contributions (tokens found by self and opponent).\n\nThe challenge is to define a utility function that captures the responder's perception of fairness. The fair share could be calculated based on the participant's and opponent's contributions. For example, if the combined_earning is the total pot, a fair split might be proportional to the tokens each contributed. However, the problem states that two equal split_self values don't represent the same fairness if the combined earnings differ, so the model must account for the actual contributions.\n\nLet me consider a model where the utility of accepting depends on the difference between the proposed split (split_self) and what's considered fair. The fair share could be calculated as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. The deviation from this fair share (split_self - fair_share) would then influence the utility. \n\nBut participants might have different sensitivities to gains and losses relative to their fair share. So maybe introducing parameters to weight these deviations. For example, a parameter \u03b1 (alpha) could scale the deviation, and another parameter \u03b2 (beta) could represent a baseline acceptance tendency. \n\nAdditionally, the model should include a term for the opponent's proposed split (split_opp), but since the responder's decision is about their own share, perhaps the opponent's split is less directly relevant. However, trial_type indicates whether the split is equal, opponent more, or participant more, which might affect the responder's perception. Maybe trial_type can modulate the fairness calculation, but since trial_type is categorical, it might be better to handle it through interaction terms or separate parameters.\n\nWait, the problem states that the model should predict responder behavior, so trial_role should be 1 (responder). The model should only consider trials where trial_role is 1. However, the dataset includes both roles, so the model will filter those trials during implementation.\n\nNow, considering parameter recovery, the model should have parameters that are identifiable. Let's outline possible parameters:\n\n1. \u03b1 (alpha): Sensitivity to the deviation from the fair share. This could be a learnable parameter with bounds, say between -5 and 5, allowing for positive or negative weighting.\n2. \u03b2 (beta): Baseline propensity to accept, regardless of the offer. Bounds could be -5 to 5.\n3. \u03b8 (theta): A parameter that adjusts the fair share calculation. For example, if participants consider their own contribution more important, the fair share could be (token_self + \u03b8 * token_opp) / (token_self + token_opp) * combined_earning. This \u03b8 would adjust how much the opponent's contribution is weighted. Bounds could be 0 to 2, where \u03b8=1 is equal weighting.\n\nThe utility function could then be:\n\nU = \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share) + \u03b2\n\nWhere fair_share is calculated using \u03b8. If U > 0, the participant is more likely to accept.\n\nBut to ensure that the utility translates to a probability via logistic function, the probability of accepting would be 1 / (1 + exp(-U)). The model's parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b8) would be learned to maximize the likelihood of the observed accept/reject decisions.\n\nNow, checking the variables:\n\n- token_self and token_opp are used to calculate fair_share.\n- split_self is compared to fair_share.\n- combined_earning is part of the fair_share calculation.\n- trial_type might influence \u03b8, but to keep the model simple, perhaps \u03b8 is a single parameter across all trial types. Alternatively, \u03b8 could vary by trial_type, but that would require more parameters. Since the dataset has 36 trials per participant, adding more parameters might complicate parameter recovery. So sticking to a single \u03b8.\n\nAnother consideration: The fair share could be a proportion of the combined_earning. For example, if the participant contributed 60% of the tokens, their fair share would be 60% of combined_earning. But \u03b8 could adjust this proportion. For instance, \u03b8 > 1 might mean the participant expects more than their proportional share, \u03b8 < 1 means they accept less.\n\nWait, the fair_share formula using \u03b8 could be:\n\nfair_share = (token_self / (token_self + \u03b8 * token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nIf \u03b8 = 1, it's proportional. If \u03b8 < 1, the opponent's tokens are discounted, leading to a higher fair share. If \u03b8 > 1, the opponent's tokens are overvalued, leading to a lower fair share. This might be a better way to parameterize the fairness perception.\n\nSo the utility becomes:\n\nU = \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share) + \u03b2\n\nWhere fair_share is calculated as above. This way, \u03b8 captures how much the participant values the opponent's contribution relative to their own.\n\nParameters:\n\n- \u03b1: Sensitivity to deviation from fair share. Bounds could be [-10, 10] to allow strong positive or negative effects.\n- \u03b2: Baseline acceptance. Bounds [-10, 10].\n- \u03b8: Weight on opponent's tokens. Bounds [0.1, 5], ensuring it's positive and non-zero.\n\nThis model uses three learnable parameters. The variables used are token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, split_self, and accept (as the target). Trial_role is used to filter responder trials.\n\nNow, ensuring that the model can be implemented with the given dataset. All required variables are present. The model doesn't use variables like split_opp or proposed_perc since those are relevant to the proposer role, which is excluded when trial_role=1.\n\nFor parameter recovery, each participant's 36 trials provide enough data to estimate three parameters. The model's simplicity aids in recovery, and the parameters have clear interpretations.\n\nThe utility function's output is unbounded, which aligns with the requirement. The probability of acceptance is logistic(U), so when U < 0, the probability is less than 0.5, meeting the fourth condition.\n\nFinally, the variable descriptions need to be clearly defined in JSON format, specifying each parameter's range, learnability, and source. The model's mathematical formula is enclosed in <MODEL> tags, and the target variable is accept.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * (split_self - (token_self / (token_self + theta * token_opp)) * combined_earning) + beta\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposal\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to deviation from fair share\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Baseline acceptance tendency\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"theta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weighting factor for opponent's contribution in fairness calculation\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.1,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Participant's own token contribution\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"data_min\",\n        \"max\": \"data_max\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Opponent's token contribution\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"data_min\",\n        \"max\": \"data_max\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"data_min\",\n        \"max\": \"data_max\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total money in shared pot\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"data_min\",\n        \"max\": \"data_max\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>accept</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA fairness-based utility model where acceptance probability depends on linear combination of deviation from contribution-weighted fair share and baseline tendency.
