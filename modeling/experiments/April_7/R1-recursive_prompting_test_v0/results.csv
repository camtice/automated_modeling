Okay, let's analyze the previous results. The last model had a BIC of 33.44, accuracy around 0.797, and parameter recovery for alpha (0.637), beta (0.780), and theta (0.356). Theta's recovery was particularly low, indicating issues with identifiability or model structure. The model included three parameters: alpha (sensitivity to deviation), beta (baseline acceptance), and theta (opponent contribution weighting).

The problem seems to be that theta isn't being recovered well. Maybe the way theta is incorporated into the fairness calculation isn't capturing the right dynamics. Also, the baseline beta might be collinear with alpha, making it harder to estimate both. The previous instructions tried a more complex model with lambda, beta, gamma, kappa, and rho, but that might have been too complex, leading to higher BIC.

To improve parameter recovery and lower BIC, we need a model that better disentangles the parameters. Let's consider removing the baseline beta parameter to reduce collinearity. Instead, model the baseline as part of the utility function through another mechanism. Also, rethinking the fairness calculation to make theta's role more distinct.

Another angle: The previous model used a linear combination of deviation from fair share plus a baseline. Maybe introducing nonlinearities, like prospect theory's value function, could better capture how participants perceive gains and losses relative to their fairness reference. This would separate gain and loss sensitivities, which might improve parameter recovery.

Additionally, the low recovery for theta suggests that the way opponent contributions are weighted isn't aligning with participants' actual behavior. Perhaps participants adjust their fairness expectations based on the trial type (e.g., whether they contributed more, less, or equal). Incorporating trial_type into the model could help, but that adds parameters. Alternatively, use a dynamic weighting that depends on the relative contributions.

Here's a plan for the new instructions:

1. **Dynamic Fairness Weighting:** Replace theta with a function that adjusts the weight on opponent's tokens based on the relative contribution. For example, use a sigmoid function to smoothly transition between weighting schemes depending on whether the participant contributed more or less.

2. **Prospect-Theoretic Utility:** Split the deviation into gains and losses relative to the fair share, applying different power functions for each. This introduces separate parameters for gain and loss sensitivity, which can improve identifiability.

3. **Trial-Type Modulation:** Allow the fairness calculation to be modulated by the trial_type (equal, opponent more, participant more) through interaction terms, but keep the number of parameters manageable.

4. **Remove Baseline Parameter:** Eliminate the beta parameter to reduce collinearity and focus the model on the deviation from fairness.

By implementing these changes, the model can better capture the underlying decision processes, leading to improved parameter recovery and lower BIC.

**Instructions for Run 10:**  
Design a **neuroeconomic bargaining model** that implements *adaptive norm enforcement* through these mechanisms:  

1. **Dynamic Contribution Elasticity:**  
   ```  
   fairness_weight = 1 / (1 + exp(-τ*(token_self - token_opp)))  
   fair_share = [fairness_weight * token_self + (1 - fairness_weight) * η] / [fairness_weight * (token_self + token_opp) + (1 - fairness_weight)*2η] * combined_earning  
   ```  
   - τ ∈ [0.1,5] controls *sensitivity to contribution asymmetry*  
   - η ∈ [1,10] represents *minimum acceptable equality floor*  

2. **Dual-Channel Disappointment Coding:**  
   ```  
   U = β_gain*(split_self - fair_share)^γ - β_loss*|fair_share - split_self|^{1.7} + π*log(1 + split_self/historical_median)  
   ```  
   - γ ∈ [0.3,0.9] governs *diminishing returns for advantageous inequality*  
   - β_gain ∈ [0.5,3] and β_loss ∈ [0.5,3] control asymmetric sensitivity  
   - π ∈ [-2,2] captures *greed acclimation* relative to `historical_median`  

3. **Adaptive Reference Updating:**  
   ```  
   historical_median = percentile_trimmed_mean(split_self_prev, 0.2)

- Enforce β_loss > β_gain through parameterization β_loss = β_gain + δ where δ ∈ [0.1,2]  
- Force γ < 0.9 through hard optimization constraints  

**Validation Targets:**  
- Achieve τ-γ correlation > 0.9 in parameter recovery  
- Keep BIC < 32 through strategic nonlinearity

So:

<MODEL>
U = beta * (split_self - (alpha * 3 * token_self + (1 - alpha) * 0.5 * combined_earning)) + gamma","A utility model combining equity-based (proportional to tokens found) and equality-based (50/50 split) fairness norms. Learnable parameters control the weighting between fairness types (α), sensitivity to deviations from fair offers (β), and baseline acceptance bias (γ). Utility is calculated as a linear function of the offer's deviation from a weighted fairness reference.",v0,"<think>
Okay, let's look at the previous results. The model had a BIC of 32.49, which is okay, but maybe we can improve. The accuracy was around 78.5%, which is decent but there's room for improvement. The parameter recovery for alpha was only 0.533, which is moderate, while beta was 0.94, which is good. So the main issue is alpha's recovery.

Why is alpha's recovery lower? Maybe the model's alpha parameter isn't well-identified. High covariance between parameters could be a problem, but the model only has two parameters. Alternatively, the model's structure might not capture the underlying psychological mechanisms well enough. For example, the current model combines equity and equality linearly, but maybe participants use a different weighting or nonlinear combination.

The previous instructions told the model to consider high covariance and use fewer parameters. But since alpha's recovery is low, perhaps the model needs a different functional form for alpha's role. Maybe introducing a nonlinearity could help. For example, using a sigmoid function to transform alpha, or allowing different weights for over vs. under offers.

Another thought: the current model uses a linear combination of equity and equality. Maybe participants have different sensitivities when their share is below versus above the reference. For instance, they might be more sensitive to receiving less than their fair share. Adding a parameter to differentiate between these could improve the model, even if it adds another parameter. But the previous run had two parameters, and adding a third might complicate recovery. However, if the parameters are orthogonal, it might help.

Alternatively, the model could use a reference point that's a nonlinear combination of equity and equality. For example, alpha could determine a convex combination, but with a nonlinear scaling. Or, the model could include a term that accounts for the difference between the proposed split and both equity and equality, allowing for separate weights.

Another angle: the current model's utility is split_self minus the reference plus beta. Maybe the way beta is incorporated could be adjusted. For example, beta could be a scaling factor for the entire utility, or interact with another variable. But that might not directly address alpha's recovery.

Also, the model's variables: combined_earning is used, but maybe including token_opp could add more information. Although token_opp is part of combined_earning, explicitly using it might help. Wait, the current model already uses token_self and combined_earning, which includes token_opp indirectly. But maybe an explicit term for the opponent's contribution could help.

Wait, the equity term is 3*token_self, which is the participant's contribution in pounds. The equality term is 0.5*combined_earning. But maybe participants compare their split to both their own contribution and the opponent's. For example, the ratio of split_self to their contribution versus split_opp to the opponent's contribution. That could be another fairness measure.

Alternatively, the model could include a term for the difference between split_self and split_opp, but that might not be necessary since split_opp is determined by split_self and combined_earning.

Another idea: the current model uses a static alpha, but maybe alpha varies depending on the trial type. For example, if the participant contributed more (trial_type 3), they might weight equity higher. But trial_type is a data variable, so the model can't use it unless it's included. However, the instructions say to use the provided variables, so maybe incorporating trial_type could improve the model. But the previous model didn't use trial_type, so maybe that's a direction.

But the model needs to predict based on the available variables. If trial_type is available, perhaps including an interaction term with alpha. For example, alpha could be modulated by trial_type. But that would require additional parameters, which might complicate things.

Alternatively, the model could have separate alphas for different trial types, but that would increase the number of parameters. However, given that the previous model had only two parameters, adding a third might be manageable if it significantly improves fit and recovery.

Another consideration: the utility function's linearity might not capture diminishing sensitivity. For example, a £1 difference from the reference might matter more when the reference is small. Using a nonlinear transformation (e.g., log, square root) could help, but that adds complexity.

The previous instructions emphasized avoiding high covariance and fewer parameters. But since alpha's recovery is problematic, maybe allowing a more flexible model with an additional parameter could help, even if it slightly increases the parameter count. The key is to ensure parameters are identifiable.

So, the new instructions should encourage exploring different functional forms for combining equity and equality, possibly introducing nonlinearities or interaction terms. Also, consider parameters that account for asymmetric sensitivity to gains and losses relative to the reference. Additionally, using trial_type or other variables to modulate alpha or beta could improve the model's flexibility.

The revised instructions should guide the model to:

1. Explore nonlinear combinations of equity and equality (e.g., multiplicative terms, sigmoid weights).
2. Consider asymmetric parameters for over vs. under offers relative to the reference.
3. Use trial_type or other variables to modulate fairness weights.
4. Ensure parameters are orthogonal to improve recovery.
5. Maintain a balance between model complexity and parameter identifiability.

By encouraging these directions, the next model might better capture the underlying decision processes, leading to improved accuracy, lower BIC, and better parameter recovery, especially for alpha.

**Instructions for Run 2/10:**  
Focus on improving alpha recovery (r=0.533) while maintaining beta's strong performance. Consider these directions:  

1. **Nonlinear Fairness Integration**  
   - Explore multiplicative interactions between equity/equality terms (e.g., α*(equity term)*(equality term))  
   - Test sigmoidal weighting functions for alpha rather than linear blending  

2. **Asymmetric Sensitivity**  
   - Implement separate parameters for responses to:  
     a) Offers below vs. above reference points  
     b) Equity violations vs. equality violations  

3. **Context-Dependent Weighting**  
   - Allow alpha to dynamically scale with contribution ratios (token_self/token_opp)  
   - Consider trial_type-dependent fairness rules (e.g., different weights when participant contributed more)  

4. **Parameter Orthogonality**  
   - Introduce mathematically orthogonal terms (e.g., interaction terms with near-zero covariance)  
   - Test power transformations (x^γ) of key variables to decouple parameter influences

<MODEL>
U = alpha * (split_self - (token_self / (token_self + theta * token_opp)) * combined_earning) + beta","A fairness-based utility model where acceptance probability depends on linear combination of deviation from contribution-weighted fair share and baseline tendency. Theta controls perceived fairness weighting of opponent's contribution, alpha scales sensitivity to unfairness, and beta represents inherent acceptance bias. Logistic function converts utility to acceptance probability.",v0,"<think>

Okay, let's look at the previous run. The model had a BIC of 36.07, which is better than some earlier models but still room for improvement. The accuracy was around 0.79, which is decent but could be higher. The parameter recovery for alpha was great (0.955), theta was okay (0.684), and beta was lower (0.378). So beta's recovery is a problem.

The previous instructions suggested a model with lambda, beta_gain, beta_loss, and gamma_gain, fixing gamma_loss as 2 - gamma_gain. But maybe the fixed relationship between gamma_gain and gamma_loss is limiting. For example, if gamma_gain is 0.3, gamma_loss would be 1.7, which is still convex. But maybe allowing them to vary independently could capture more nuanced behavior, even if it adds a parameter. However, that increases model complexity, which affects BIC. But the previous run had three parameters (alpha, theta, beta) and now we have four. Wait, the previous run's model had alpha, theta, beta, but the new instructions for run 8 suggested four parameters. However, the results here are from run 7, which had alpha, theta, beta. So maybe the next step is to address the beta parameter's poor recovery.

The beta parameter in the previous model was a baseline acceptance tendency. If it's not recovering well, perhaps it's collinear with other parameters. For example, if the model includes both a baseline beta and a sensitivity alpha, there might be trade-offs between them during fitting. To improve identifiability, maybe remove the baseline term (beta) and let the model rely solely on the deviation from fairness. Alternatively, structure the model so that parameters are orthogonal.

Another angle: The previous model used a linear combination of deviation from fair share plus a baseline. Maybe the baseline is not necessary, and removing it (beta) would reduce parameters and improve recovery. Alternatively, make the baseline a function of other variables, like trial type or group, but that requires more data.

Looking at the parameter recovery, theta (0.684) and beta (0.378) are lower. Theta controls the weighting of own contribution in the fairness calculation. Maybe the model's fairness threshold isn't capturing the right dynamics. For example, participants might have different fairness norms depending on whether they contributed more or less than the opponent. Introducing a trial_type-dependent lambda could help. For instance, if trial_type is 1 (equal), 2 (opponent more), or 3 (participant more), lambda could vary accordingly. But this adds more parameters, which might not be ideal.

Alternatively, use a nonlinear function for lambda based on the token difference. For example, lambda = theta * (token_self - token_opp)/(token_self + token_opp) + 1. This way, when the participant contributes more, lambda decreases, increasing their fair share. But this introduces theta as a learnable parameter scaling the token difference effect.

Another idea: Incorporate a sigmoid function to smoothly transition between contribution-based and equal split fairness. For example, lambda = 1 + theta * (token_self - token_opp)/(token_self + token_opp). But this requires careful bounding of theta to keep lambda within [0,2].

To address beta's poor recovery, perhaps remove it. The utility becomes U = alpha * deviation, with no baseline. This reduces parameters and might improve identifiability. Alternatively, tie beta to another parameter, like beta = gamma * alpha, but that's speculative.

The previous instructions for run 8 suggested separating gain and loss curvature. The current model (run 7) didn't do that, so moving to a prospect-theoretic model with separate gain and loss parameters could help. For example, if participants are more sensitive to losses (getting less than fair), the model could have different sensitivities for positive and negative deviations.

So, the new model could be:

U = beta_gain * (max(deviation, 0))^gamma_gain + beta_loss * (min(deviation, 0))^gamma_loss

Where deviation = split_self - fair_share, and fair_share is calculated with a lambda parameter.

This introduces four parameters: lambda, beta_gain, beta_loss, gamma_gain, gamma_loss. But to keep it to four, maybe fix gamma_loss = 2 - gamma_gain as before. Then the parameters are lambda, beta_gain, beta_loss, gamma_gain.

Additionally, to enforce identifiability, set beta_gain >=0 and beta_loss <=0, so they can't cancel each other out. This separation might improve parameter recovery as each parameter affects a distinct part of the utility function.

Another consideration: The fairness calculation. The previous model used theta to weight own contribution. Maybe a better approach is to let lambda represent the weight on the opponent's contribution. For example:

fair_share = (token_self + lambda * token_opp) / (token_self + token_opp) * combined_earning

Here, lambda=1 means contributions are weighted equally, lambda=0 means only self's contribution matters. This is similar to the previous approach but more interpretable.

Putting it all together, the new instructions should guide towards a model with:

1. A fairness reference based on a weighted sum of contributions (lambda).
2. Separate gain and loss terms with power functions.
3. Constraints on parameters to ensure identifiability.
4. Removal of the baseline beta parameter to reduce collinearity.

This should improve parameter recovery (especially for the sensitivity parameters) and potentially lower BIC by better capturing the underlying decision process.

**Instructions for Run 9:**  
Design a model that **radically redefines fairness perception through opponent contribution mirroring** while **introducing asymmetric power laws for gain/loss domains**. Implement these counterintuitive features:  

1. **Reciprocal Fairness Threshold:**  
   Compute fairness as:  
   `fair_share = ( (1 + λ) * token_self ) / ( (1 + λ) * token_self + token_opp ) * combined_earning`  
   where λ ∈ [-0.5,1] controls *strategic discounting* of opponent contributions (λ < 0 → adversarial weighting, λ > 0 → cooperative weighting).  

2. **Biophysical Utility Scaling:**  
   ```  
   U = β * [ (max(deviation,0))^{γ} / (1 + κ*gain_context) - |min(deviation,0)|^{1.5-γ} ]  
   ```  
   - γ ∈ [0.2,0.8] controls *neural diminishing returns* for gains  
   - κ ∈ [0,2] scales *post-reward satiation* using `gain_context = max(0, split_self - historical_mean)`  
   - β ∈ [0.1,5] as overall scaling  

3. **Dynamic Anchoring:**  
   Compute `historical_mean` as exponentially weighted average:  
   `historical_mean_t = ρ * split_self_{t-1} + (1-ρ) * historical_mean_{t-1}`  
   with ρ ∈ [0.01,0.3] constraining memory persistence  

**Key Innovations:**  
- λ < 0 allows modeling *spiteful utility* where opponents' contributions actively reduce perceived fairness  
- κ creates trial-by-trial habituation to generous offers  
- 1.5-γ in loss exponent forces anti-symmetry with gain curvature

Utility depends on linear sensitivity to deviations from this reference plus a baseline bias parameter. Three learnable parameters control the equity-equality tradeoff (α), deviation sensitivity (β), and baseline acceptance tendency (γ).",v0,"<think>

Okay, let's analyze the previous results. The last model had a BIC of around 33.94, which is okay, but there's room for improvement. The parameter recovery for alpha was decent (r=0.783), beta was excellent (0.956), and gamma was lower (0.682). The accuracy was around 0.785. The main area to improve is gamma's recovery and possibly BIC by simplifying or enhancing the model's structure.

The previous model used a linear combination of equity and equality with separate parameters for positive and negative deviations. However, gamma's lower recovery suggests that the baseline bias isn't being captured well. Maybe gamma is conflated with other parameters. To address this, perhaps introduce a non-linear interaction between gamma and the deviation terms. For example, gamma could modulate the baseline differently based on the direction of the deviation.

Another angle: The model could incorporate trial_type information to adjust alpha dynamically. For instance, in trials where the participant contributed more (trial_type=3), alpha might be more influential. This could be done by scaling alpha with a function of trial_type without adding new parameters. For example, alpha_effective = alpha * (1 + (trial_type == 3)), but since trial_type is a data variable, this doesn't add parameters. This could help alpha's recovery by making it context-sensitive.

Alternatively, use a softmax function for alpha to ensure it stays within [0,1] while allowing it to vary based on trial features. For example, alpha = sigmoid(theta * (token_self - token_opp)), where theta is a learnable parameter. This would tie alpha to the actual contribution difference, making it more interpretable and improving recovery. However, this introduces a new parameter (theta), so we need to replace one of the existing parameters. Maybe replace gamma with theta, but that might reduce accuracy.

Wait, the constraint is to keep three parameters. So, perhaps replace gamma with a parameter that controls the dynamic weighting of alpha. For example, U = beta * [max(deviation,0) + gamma * min(deviation,0)] + delta, but that adds delta. Not allowed.

Another idea: Use a single parameter to control the asymmetry between positive and negative deviations. For example, U = beta * (split_self - fair_ref) + gamma * (split_self - fair_ref) * (split_self > fair_ref). This way, gamma only affects positive deviations, creating an interaction. But this might not capture the full asymmetry.

Alternatively, model the utility as a piecewise function where beta applies to positive deviations and gamma to negative, but without using max/min functions. For example, U = beta * (split_self - fair_ref) * (split_self >= fair_ref) + gamma * (split_self - fair_ref) * (split_self < fair_ref). This explicitly separates the effects, which could help in parameter recovery.

Additionally, consider the role of combined_earning. The current model uses 0.5 * combined_earning for equality, but maybe participants have a different equality reference, like 50% of the combined earning scaled by a parameter. However, that would add another parameter. Instead, perhaps allow alpha to also scale the equality term nonlinearly. For example, fair_ref = alpha * 3 * token_self + (1 - alpha) * (0.5 * combined_earning)^theta, where theta is a learnable parameter. But again, this adds a parameter.

Given the three-parameter limit, the best approach might be to refine the asymmetry in the current model. Perhaps introduce a curvature parameter by applying a power function to the deviation. For example, U = beta * (split_self - fair_ref)^2 + gamma. This quadratic term could capture diminishing or increasing sensitivity to larger deviations. However, this might worsen BIC due to increased complexity without sufficient benefit.

Alternatively, use an absolute value with separate coefficients: U = beta * |split_self - fair_ref| + gamma * sign(split_self - fair_ref). This separates the magnitude and direction effects, allowing beta to control sensitivity to deviation size and gamma to baseline direction bias. This could disentangle gamma's role, improving its recovery.

In summary, the key improvements could be:

1. Explicitly separate magnitude and direction of deviations into different parameters.
2. Introduce dynamic weighting of alpha based on trial features (like contribution ratio) without adding parameters.
3. Apply nonlinear transformations to deviations to better capture human sensitivity.

These adjustments should enhance parameter identifiability, especially for gamma and alpha, leading to better recovery and potentially lower BIC.
</think>

**Instructions for Run 6:**  

Design a model that **explicitly decouples magnitude and direction sensitivity** while incorporating **dynamic fairness weighting**. Use these strategies:  

1. **Directional Baseline Bias:** Replace the global bias term (γ) with a parameter that *only activates when offers fall below the fairness reference*. For example:  
   `U = β * |deviation| + θ * (deviation < 0)`  
   where θ acts as a rejection penalty for unfair offers.  

2. **Contribution-Weighted α:** Dynamically scale α by the participant’s relative contribution:  
   `α_effective = α * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp))`  
   This grounds fairness expectations in objective contribution ratios without new parameters.  

3. **Diminishing Sensitivity:** Apply a logarithmic or square root transformation to |deviation| to capture human nonlinear valuation (e.g., `log(1 + |deviation|)`).  

**Constraints:**  
- Use ≤3 learnable parameters (e.g., α, β, θ).  
- Ensure parameters have distinct roles (magnitude vs. directional bias vs. fairness type).  
- Bounds: Keep α ∈ [0,1], β ∈ [0,10], θ ∈ [-5,0] to reflect penalty semantics.  

**Goal:** Improve γ/θ recovery (r > 0.8) while maintaining BIC < 33.",0.9043923696497346,0.38809256299249145,0.6809276326477302,

Beta scales sensitivity to deviations from this personalized fairness reference, while gamma captures baseline acceptance tendencies. Utility is converted to acceptance probability via logistic function.",v0,"<think>

Okay, let's look at the previous run's results. The BIC was 33.43, accuracy around 79.6%, which is better than the first model. The parameter recovery for alpha improved to 0.804, beta to 0.761, and gamma to 0.625. So alpha's recovery is much better now, but gamma's is lower. The main goal now is to further improve accuracy and BIC while maintaining or enhancing parameter recovery, especially for gamma.

The previous instructions focused on nonlinear fairness integration, asymmetric sensitivity, context-dependent weighting, and parameter orthogonality. The model from run 2 added a third parameter (gamma) which helped alpha's recovery but gamma's recovery is moderate. Maybe gamma is not capturing a distinct psychological process, leading to some covariance with other parameters.

To improve gamma's recovery, the model needs to ensure that gamma represents a unique component not explained by other parameters. Perhaps gamma is a baseline acceptance bias that's independent of the fairness calculation. However, if the model's utility function already includes a term that captures baseline tendencies, maybe gamma is redundant or not well-identified.

Another angle: the current model uses a linear combination of fairness terms scaled by beta and added to gamma. If beta and gamma are correlated, their recovery might suffer. To decouple them, perhaps introduce a nonlinear interaction between beta and the fairness deviation, or allow beta to have different components for different aspects.

The previous run's instructions suggested using trial_type-dependent fairness rules. The current model doesn't use trial_type, so incorporating it could help. For example, when trial_type is 3 (participant contributed more), alpha could be higher, but that would require an interaction term with trial_type, adding parameters. However, the design constraint is a maximum of 3 parameters. So maybe use trial_type to modulate alpha without adding new parameters. For instance, alpha = sigmoid(delta * trial_type), where delta is a learnable parameter. But that would require a new parameter, which exceeds the limit. Alternatively, use trial_type as a multiplier in the utility function.

Alternatively, use the ratio of token_self to token_opp as a dynamic weight for alpha. For example, alpha could be calculated as token_self / (token_self + token_opp), which is data-driven and doesn't require a learnable parameter. But that would remove alpha as a learnable parameter, which might not be ideal. Alternatively, scale alpha by this ratio, introducing a multiplicative term.

Another idea: introduce a nonlinear transformation of the fairness deviation. For example, take the absolute value of the deviation, or square it, to capture different sensitivity to the magnitude of unfairness. This could be controlled by a new parameter, but again, parameter count is limited. Maybe replace the linear beta scaling with a power function, e.g., beta * (deviation)^gamma, but that would repurpose gamma, which might not be ideal.

To improve gamma's recovery, perhaps make it context-dependent. For example, gamma could vary with trial_type, but that would require additional parameters. Alternatively, split gamma into two terms: one for when the offer is above the reference and one for below. But that adds parameters.

Given the constraint of 3 parameters, the model needs to find a way to better differentiate the roles of alpha, beta, and gamma. Maybe gamma should interact with another variable that's orthogonal to the fairness calculation. For example, include a term that's only active when the offer is extremely low or high, allowing gamma to capture baseline acceptance in those cases.

Alternatively, use a nonlinear function for the utility, such as a logistic transformation of the fairness deviation before scaling by beta. This could help in cases where the utility has diminishing returns, which might separate the effects of beta and gamma.

Another approach is to model the utility as a combination of two separate fairness deviations: one for equity and one for equality, each scaled by their own sensitivity parameters. Then, gamma is added as a baseline. This would require two sensitivity parameters (beta_equity, beta_equality) and gamma, totaling three parameters. This way, alpha is replaced by the relative scaling of the two betas, but that might not directly help. Alternatively, keep alpha as the weight between equity and equality, but have separate sensitivities for each, leading to more parameters. But with the 3-parameter limit, this isn't feasible.

Wait, the current model has alpha, beta, gamma. Maybe reparameterize to have beta_equity and beta_equality instead of alpha and beta. For example: U = beta_equity * (split_self - 3*token_self) + beta_equality * (split_self - 0.5*combined_earning) + gamma. This model uses two sensitivity parameters for equity and equality deviations, and a baseline. This could allow for better parameter recovery if the two betas are orthogonal. However, this would replace alpha with two parameters, totaling three (beta_equity, beta_equality, gamma). This might capture the same information as the alpha-weighted model but with different parameterization. Whether this improves recovery depends on the data structure.

Alternatively, use a multiplicative term between alpha and beta to reduce covariance. For example, U = (alpha * beta) * (split_self - 3*token_self) + ((1 - alpha) * beta) * (split_self - 0.5*combined_earning) + gamma. This ties beta to both terms, which might not help. Alternatively, have separate beta terms for equity and equality: U = beta_equity * (split_self - 3*token_self) + beta_equality * (split_self - 0.5*combined_earning) + gamma. This model has three parameters and might allow better identification if equity and equality deviations are not perfectly correlated.

Another thought: the current model's fairness reference is a weighted average. Perhaps participants use a different reference, such as the maximum of equity and equality. Or a nonlinear combination. For example, U = beta * (split_self - max(3*token_self, 0.5*combined_earning)) + gamma. This would change the reference point but might not require additional parameters. However, the max function is non-differentiable, which could complicate parameter estimation. Alternatively, use a softmax function with a temperature parameter, but that adds another parameter.

Considering the instructions for run 3, the focus should be on further improving parameter recovery (especially gamma) and accuracy. The new instructions should encourage models that:

1. Introduce orthogonal terms to decouple gamma from alpha and beta.
2. Explore nonlinear transformations of the fairness deviation to capture different sensitivity effects.
3. Utilize trial_type or token ratios to modulate fairness calculations without adding parameters.
4. Test alternative reference points (e.g., hybrid max/mean, context-dependent thresholds).
5. Consider asymmetric sensitivity parameters for over vs. under offers relative to both equity and equality norms.

By guiding the model towards these directions, the next iteration might achieve better performance.

**Instructions for Run 3/10:**  
Introduce *dynamic nonlinear scaling* to disentangle gamma from fairness computations. Prioritize:  

1. **Reference Point Specialization**  
   - Implement distinct parameters for deviations above/below *both* equity and equality norms  
   - Example: `U = β_equity_under*(fairness_gap_equity)⁻ + β_equity_over*(gap)⁺ + ... + γ`  

2. **Contextual Baseline Modulation**  
   - Make gamma sensitive to absolute contribution ratios:  
     `γ = γ_base + γ_scale * (token_self/(token_self+token_opp))`  

3. **Dual-Path Fairness**  
   - Process equity/equality violations through separate nonlinear transforms before combining:  
     ```  
     U_equity = β1 * tanh(split_self - equity_ref)  
     U_equality = β2 * (split_self - equality_ref)^3  
     U = α*U_equity + (1-α)*U_equality + γ  
     ```  

4. **Parameter Constraints**  
   - Enforce β_equity > β_equality when token_self > token_opp via:  
     `β_equity = β_base * (1 + relu(token_self - token_opp))`  

*Design constraint:* Maximum 3 learnable parameters. Sacrifice symmetry in fairness terms if it improves identifiability.",0.7771485312101984,0.7054250529181902,0.8116824753468945,

The utility function incorporates three learnable parameters: α (fairness weighting), β (deviation sensitivity), and γ (baseline bias). Logistic transformation converts utility to accept probabilities.",v0,"<think>

Okay, let's look at the previous run's results. The BIC was 39.31, which is higher than previous models, indicating worse fit. However, accuracy improved slightly to 0.801. The parameter recovery for alpha was really low (r=0.25), beta was good (0.925), and gamma was moderate (0.705). The main issue here is alpha's poor recovery and the higher BIC.

The previous model used a linear combination of equity and equality norms with parameters alpha, beta, gamma. The problem might be that alpha isn't identifiable when the equity and equality references are correlated or when the model doesn't sufficiently differentiate their contributions. 

To improve alpha's recovery, the model needs to create situations where alpha's effect is more distinct. Maybe introducing nonlinear interactions between alpha and the fairness components. For example, if alpha modulates not just the weight but also the scaling of each component. Alternatively, using a sigmoid function to bound alpha's effect dynamically based on other variables.

Another angle: The model could incorporate an asymmetry in how equity and equality deviations are treated. For instance, participants might be more sensitive to under-equity offers but not over-equity, or vice versa. This could be modeled with separate parameters for positive and negative deviations, but we need to stay within three parameters. Maybe use a single parameter that controls the asymmetry for both equity and equality.

Wait, the previous model had three parameters. Let's think of a way to reparameterize to capture asymmetry without adding more parameters. For example, instead of a single beta for the deviation, have beta_equity and beta_equality, but that would require two parameters plus gamma, making four. Not allowed.

Alternative idea: Use a nonlinear transformation of the deviation that depends on alpha. For example, U = beta * (split_self - [alpha * equity + (1-alpha) * equality])^3 + gamma. The cubic term would create an S-shaped curve, allowing beta to capture different sensitivities based on the direction and magnitude of the deviation. This might help in disentangling alpha and beta effects, as the cubic term amplifies larger deviations.

Alternatively, use an absolute value function with a sign modulated by alpha: U = beta * |split_self - [alpha * equity + (1-alpha) * equality]| * sign(deviation) + gamma. This separates the magnitude and direction, which could help beta capture sensitivity more clearly.

Another approach: Introduce a dynamic alpha that depends on the trial's characteristics. For example, alpha could be influenced by the ratio of token_self to token_opp, but without adding a new parameter. Maybe alpha_effective = alpha * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)). This way, alpha's weight is adjusted based on the participant's contribution proportion, making it more context-dependent and possibly improving identifiability.

Wait, but this would still use the same alpha parameter, just scaled by data. It might not add a new parameter but could make alpha's effect more variable across trials, aiding recovery.

Alternatively, model the utility as a combination of equity and equality deviations with separate nonlinearities. For example, U = beta_equity * tanh(equity_deviation) + beta_equality * tanh(equality_deviation) + gamma. But this requires two betas, which with alpha would be four parameters. Not feasible.

Hmm. Another idea: Use a single parameter to control the curvature of the utility function. For example, U = beta * (split_self - [alpha * equity + (1-alpha) * equality]) + gamma * (split_self - [alpha * equity + (1-alpha) * equality])^2. This introduces a quadratic term scaled by gamma, but gamma is already a baseline. This might cause multicollinearity between beta and gamma.

Alternatively, apply a nonlinear scaling to the deviation term that's controlled by alpha. For example, U = beta * (split_self - [alpha * equity + (1-alpha) * equality]) / (1 + alpha * |split_self - equity| + (1-alpha) * |split_self - equality|). This makes the utility depend on the relative deviation from both norms, but it's complex and might not help.

Wait, perhaps the key is to make the alpha parameter influence the sensitivity (beta) differently for equity and equality. For example, U = (beta * alpha) * (split_self - equity) + (beta * (1 - alpha)) * (split_self - equality) + gamma. This reparameterizes the model so that beta is scaled by alpha for equity and by (1-alpha) for equality. This ties beta and alpha together, which might improve identifiability since alpha now directly scales the beta for each component.

But in this case, the model becomes U = beta * [alpha*(split_self - equity) + (1-alpha)*(split_self - equality)] + gamma, which simplifies to the original model. So no change.

Another angle: Introduce a non-linear interaction between alpha and the combined_earning. For example, U = beta * (split_self - [alpha * 3 * token_self + (1 - alpha) * 0.5 * combined_earning]) + gamma * alpha * combined_earning. This allows gamma to vary with alpha and the total pot, but adds a term that might help in differentiating parameters.

However, this introduces an interaction term that could complicate the model. It might not be necessary.

Alternatively, use trial_type as a moderator. For example, in trial_type 3 (participant contributed more), alpha could be forced to 1, but that's too restrictive. Instead, allow alpha to be multiplied by a factor based on trial_type. For example, alpha_effective = alpha * (1 + trial_type == 3). But trial_type isn't a learnable parameter, so this would use the data to modulate alpha without adding parameters. This could help alpha's recovery by making it more context-dependent.

But how to implement this without adding parameters? Maybe:

U = beta * (split_self - [alpha * (1 + delta * (trial_type == 3)) * 3 * token_self + (1 - alpha * (1 + delta * (trial_type == 3))) * 0.5 * combined_earning]) + gamma

But delta would be a new parameter. Exceeds three parameters.

Alternatively, drop gamma and use trial_type to influence alpha. For example, alpha = alpha_base + alpha_mod * (trial_type == 3). But again, adds a parameter.

Given the constraints, perhaps the best approach is to introduce a nonlinear transformation of the deviation term that allows beta and gamma to have more distinct roles. For example, using a rectified linear unit (ReLU) for positive or negative deviations:

U = beta * max(deviation, 0) + gamma * min(deviation, 0) + delta

But this introduces delta as a new parameter. Alternatively, set delta to zero and have:

U = beta * max(deviation, 0) + gamma * min(deviation, 0)

This uses two parameters (beta, gamma) for sensitivity to over and under offers, plus alpha. But that's three parameters (alpha, beta, gamma). This could help in differentiating beta and gamma's effects, improving their recovery. Alpha still controls the fairness reference.

So the model becomes:

U = beta * max(split_self - fair_ref, 0) + gamma * min(split_self - fair_ref, 0)

Where fair_ref = alpha * 3 * token_self + (1 - alpha) * 0.5 * combined_earning.

This separates the sensitivity to offers above and below the fairness reference, with beta capturing the sensitivity to generous offers and gamma to stingy ones. Alpha still determines the reference point. This could improve parameter recovery as beta and gamma now have distinct roles, and alpha's effect is isolated to the reference.

This model uses three parameters (alpha, beta, gamma) but decouples their effects. Beta and gamma now handle different aspects of the deviation, which might reduce their correlation and improve recovery. Additionally, the separation might better capture real behavior where people react differently to being over vs. under offered.

Testing this model could lead to better parameter recovery for alpha, as the reference point's effect is more pronounced when deviations are split into positive and negative. Beta and gamma's recovery might also improve as they're no longer entangled in a single linear term.
</think>

**Revised Instructions for Run 5:**

Design a model that **explicitly differentiates sensitivity to offers above vs. below the fairness reference** to disentangle parameter effects. Consider these directions:

1. **Asymmetric Utility:** Split the fairness deviation into positive (generous) and negative (stingy) components, each scaled by separate parameters (e.g., *β* for over-offers, *γ* for under-offers). This forces distinct roles for parameters governing sensitivity.  
   Example:  
   `U = β*max(deviation,0) + γ*min(deviation,0)`  
   where `deviation = split_self − [α*(equity) + (1−α)*(equality)]`.

2. **Dynamic Reference Weighting:** Allow the equity-equality weighting (α) to interact nonlinearly with trial features (e.g., modulate α by the relative contribution ratio `token_self/(token_self+token_opp)`), creating context-dependent fairness norms without adding parameters.

3. **Nonlinear Scaling:** Apply sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent transformations to the deviation term to capture diminishing sensitivity to extreme offers, decoupling scaling (β) from baseline bias (γ).

**Constraints:**  
- Retain ≤3 learnable parameters.  
- Use only",0.7827373256503412,0.9563091447638976,0.6822795544919058,

The fair share is computed by non-linearly weighting the participant's own tokens (theta) against the opponent's. Utility combines deviation from this dynamic fairness threshold with a baseline acceptance bias (beta), scaled by sensitivity parameter alpha. Parameters allow recovery of strategic weighting of contributions and loss aversion characteristics.",v0,"<think>

Okay, let's analyze the previous run. The BIC was 41.36, which is higher than previous models, indicating worse fit. Accuracy was 0.675, lower than the previous average of ~0.79. Parameter recovery for alpha was 0.75 and theta 0.648, which is decent but could be better. The model used a prospect-theoretic approach with alpha and theta, but maybe the structure is causing issues.

The previous instructions suggested dynamic alpha anchoring with a logistic function, valence-specific utility, and prospect-theoretic transformation. However, the result was worse. Why? Maybe the model is too complex with three parameters (theta, beta_over, gamma) leading to overfitting. Or the nonlinear components (sigmoid and power function) made parameter recovery harder.

To improve, perhaps simplify the model. Instead of using a sigmoid for alpha, maybe use a direct ratio but introduce a nonlinearity in the deviation. For example, use a piecewise function with different exponents for gains and losses. Also, ensure parameters are orthogonal. Maybe separate the sensitivity to gains and losses with different parameters and apply a power function to each.

Another angle: The previous model had theta for fairness anchoring, beta_over for gains, and gamma for curvature. But combining these might create interactions that are hard to recover. Maybe use two parameters for gain and loss sensitivities, each with their own curvature. For example, U = beta_over * (max(deviation,0))^gamma_over + beta_under * (min(deviation,0))^gamma_under. But this adds four parameters. To keep it to three, fix gamma_under = 1 or tie gamma_over and gamma_under.

Alternatively, use a single curvature parameter but different sensitivities. For example, U = beta_over * (max(deviation,0))^gamma + beta_under * (min(deviation,0))^gamma. This way, gamma affects both gains and losses but in different directions. However, beta_over and beta_under can capture asymmetric sensitivities.

Another idea: Replace the logistic function for alpha with a simpler interaction term. For example, alpha = theta * (token_self - token_opp)/(token_self + token_opp). This directly scales the contribution difference into the fairness reference, making theta a learnable weight.

Also, the previous model might not account for the total combined earning properly. Maybe participants care about absolute amounts more than percentages. So, the deviation should be in absolute terms, not relative. But the model already uses split_self minus fair_share in pounds.

To improve parameter recovery, ensure that each parameter affects a distinct aspect of the utility. For example, theta could control the fairness reference's dependence on contributions, beta_over scales positive deviations, and beta_under scales negative deviations. This separation might help in recovery.

In summary, the next model should:

1. Simplify the dynamic fairness anchoring to a linear function of contribution difference.
2. Use separate parameters for gain and loss sensitivities with a shared curvature.
3. Apply power transformations to both gains and losses to capture diminishing sensitivity.
4. Ensure parameters are orthogonal by design.

This approach reduces complexity, improves identifiability, and maintains the prospect-theoretic elements.
</think>

**Instructions for Run 8:**  
Design a model that **explicitly separates gain/loss curvature while using contribution-ratio-dependent fairness thresholds**. Implement these innovations:  

1. **Linearized Fairness Threshold:**  
   Define the fairness reference as:  
   `fair_share = (token_self + λ * token_opp) / (token_self + token_opp) * combined_earning`  
   where λ ∈ [0,2] controls how much opponents’ contributions are weighted (λ=1 → strict proportionality).  

2. **Dual-Curvature Utility:**  
   Apply independent power transformations to gains/losses:  
   ```  
   U = β_gain * (max(deviation,0))^γ_gain + β_loss * (min(deviation,0))^γ_loss  
   ```  
   Constrain γ_gain ∈ [0.3,0.9] (concave gains) and γ_loss ∈ [1.1,2] (convex losses) to enforce prospect-theoretic shape.  

3. **Identifiability Enforcement:**  
   - Fix β_gain ∈ [0,5] and β_loss ∈ [-5,0] to force orthogonal effects  
   - Prohibit baseline terms (no intercepts)  

**Key Targets:**  
- Achieve γ_gain/γ_loss recovery r > 0.7 while keeping BIC < 35  
- Test if λ > 1 implies participants overvalue opponents’ contributions  
- Use exactly 4 parameters: λ, β_gain, β_loss, γ_gain (fix γ_loss = 2 - γ_gain to reduce dimensionality)  

**Radical Suggestion:** Explore whether letting λ dynamically vary with trial type (e.g., λ increases when token_opp > token_self) improves fit without overparameterization.",0.9554319805624053,0.3777233068751741,,0.6841259147137766

The utility is calculated as a linear function of the deviation between the proposed offer and a weighted fairness reference (alpha controls equity/equality weighting). Includes sensitivity (beta) and baseline bias (gamma) parameters. The fairness reference blends the participant's contribution value (3*token_self) and an equal split (0.5*combined_earning). Logistic transformation converts utility to acceptance probability.,v0,"<think>

Okay, let's analyze the previous results. The last model had a BIC of around 33.6, accuracy of ~79.5%, and parameter recovery for gamma improved to 0.812. Alpha and beta recovery were 0.777 and 0.705, respectively. The goal now is to further improve all metrics.

The previous instructions introduced dynamic nonlinear scaling, but the model still uses three parameters. Gamma's recovery is better, but beta's is lower. Maybe beta is still entangled with other terms. To improve beta's recovery, we need to make its effect more distinct.

The previous model used separate nonlinear transforms for equity and equality deviations. However, using tanh and cubic terms might not be the most effective. Perhaps introducing asymmetric sensitivity for over vs. under offers in both equity and equality could help. For example, people might be more sensitive to receiving less than the equity reference but less sensitive to receiving more. Similarly for equality.

But with a 3-parameter limit, we need a way to capture asymmetry without adding too many parameters. Maybe use a single parameter to control the asymmetry. For instance, a parameter that scales the negative deviations more than positive ones.

Another angle: incorporate the trial_type variable. The model hasn't used it yet. For example, in trial_type 3 (participant contributed more), responders might weight equity more heavily. But how to integrate this without adding parameters? Maybe modulate alpha based on trial_type. For example, alpha = base_alpha + delta * (trial_type == 3), but delta would be a new parameter. Alternatively, use trial_type as a multiplier in the utility function without adding parameters.

Alternatively, use the ratio of token_self to token_opp as a dynamic weight. For example, alpha could be a function of this ratio, but that would require a learnable parameter to scale it. Maybe alpha = sigmoid(theta * (token_self - token_opp)), where theta is a parameter. But that adds a parameter, exceeding the limit.

Wait, the design constraint is max 3 parameters. So, need to work within that. Let's think of a way to make beta capture different sensitivities based on the direction of the deviation. For example, beta could be split into beta_positive and beta_negative, but that would require two parameters. Instead, use a single parameter to represent the ratio between positive and negative sensitivities. For instance, beta_negative = beta * gamma, but that might complicate interpretation.

Alternatively, use an asymmetric function like beta * (deviation) if deviation >0 else (beta * delta) * deviation, where delta is a new parameter. But again, parameter count is an issue.

Another idea: introduce a nonlinear interaction between alpha and the deviation. For example, U = beta * [split_self - (alpha * equity_ref + (1-alpha) * equality_ref)] + gamma * alpha. This ties gamma to alpha, which might not help. Alternatively, gamma could be modulated by the fairness deviation's sign.

Alternatively, model the utility as a piecewise function. For example, if the offer is below the equity reference, use beta_equity_under; if above, beta_equity_over. Similarly for equality. But with 3 parameters, this would require combining terms. Maybe have one beta for under both references and another for over, but that's two parameters plus gamma.

Alternatively, use the product of alpha and beta to create interaction effects, allowing beta to have different effects based on alpha's value. But this might not directly address parameter recovery.

To improve beta's recovery, perhaps make it context-dependent on the trial's characteristics. For example, beta could increase when the participant's contribution is higher, using token_self as a multiplier: beta_effective = beta * (1 + token_self / K), where K is a constant. But this introduces a hyperparameter (K) which isn't learnable, so it's not ideal.

Another approach: use the absolute value of the deviation scaled by beta, but with a separate term for the sign. For example, U = beta * |deviation| + gamma * sign(deviation). This separates the magnitude and direction effects, but requires two parameters (beta and gamma), leaving room for a third, perhaps alpha.

Wait, the current model has alpha, beta, gamma. If we reparameterize to have beta_magnitude and beta_sign, but that would exceed three parameters. Alternatively, combine gamma with the sign term: U = beta * |deviation| + (gamma * sign(deviation)). This uses two parameters, leaving room for alpha. But how does this fit with fairness norms?

Alternatively, model the utility as a combination of two separate fairness deviations (equity and equality), each with their own asymmetric sensitivity parameters. For example:

U = [beta_equity_under * (equity_dev < 0) * equity_dev + beta_equity_over * (equity_dev >=0) * equity_dev] + [beta_equality_under * (equality_dev <0) * equality_dev + beta_equality_over * (equality_dev >=0) * equality_dev] + gamma

But this requires four parameters, which is too many. To stay within three, perhaps combine the under/over sensitivities for equity and equality into a single parameter each, but that's still two parameters plus gamma. Not feasible.

Alternative idea: Use a single asymmetry parameter that scales the negative deviations differently. For example, U = beta * (deviation + lambda * min(deviation, 0)), where lambda is a learnable parameter. This way, negative deviations (unfavorable) are scaled by beta*(1 + lambda), while positive deviations remain scaled by beta. This introduces lambda as a third parameter, replacing gamma. But gamma was important for baseline bias. Maybe this trade-off isn't worth it.

Alternatively, keep gamma and introduce a single asymmetry parameter for beta. For example, U = beta * (deviation + alpha * min(deviation, 0)) + gamma. But this uses alpha for asymmetry, conflicting with its original role. Not ideal.

Hmm. Given the constraints, perhaps the best approach is to introduce a nonlinear transformation of the deviation that naturally decouples parameters. For example, using a hyperbolic tangent (tanh) to capture diminishing sensitivity to large deviations. This would allow beta to scale the entire curve, while gamma remains a baseline. The model would be:

U = beta * tanh(deviation / scale) + gamma

But 'scale' is a new parameter. To avoid adding parameters, fix 'scale' as a constant (e.g., 10), but that's arbitrary. Alternatively, absorb it into beta: U = beta * tanh(deviation) + gamma. This might work, as tanh is bounded, and beta scales the sensitivity. However, this could limit the model's ability to capture large deviations, potentially reducing accuracy.

Alternatively, use an exponential function: U = beta * (exp(deviation) - 1) + gamma. This introduces nonlinear scaling, which might help differentiate beta and gamma. But the exponential could cause numerical issues.

Another angle: Include an interaction term between the fairness deviation and the contribution ratio. For example, U = beta * deviation * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) + gamma. This makes beta's effect depend on the participant's contribution proportion, which could improve identifiability. However, this introduces a data-dependent modulation of beta without adding parameters.

Wait, this approach uses existing variables (token_self, token_opp) to modulate beta's effect. For example, if the participant contributed more, their sensitivity to deviations might be higher. This could help beta capture more context-dependent effects, improving recovery.

Putting this together:

U = beta * (split_self - (alpha * 3 * token_self + (1 - alpha) * 0.5 * combined_earning)) * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) + gamma

Here, beta is scaled by the participant's contribution ratio. This could make beta's effect more pronounced when the participant contributed more, potentially improving its identifiability. Additionally, gamma remains a separate baseline.

This model still uses three parameters (alpha, beta, gamma) but introduces a data-driven modulation of beta. This might help in decoupling beta and gamma, as beta's effect is now context-dependent, while gamma remains a constant bias. This could improve parameter recovery for beta and gamma.

Another possibility is to make gamma depend on the trial_type. For example, gamma could be higher in trials where the participant contributed more (trial_type 3). But without adding parameters, this would require using trial_type as a multiplier. For example:

gamma_effective = gamma * (1 + trial_type == 3)

But trial_type is categorical (1,2,3), so this might not be directly applicable. Alternatively, use trial_type as a dummy variable. However, this would require additional parameters unless trial_type is used as a fixed effect without a learnable weight.

Alternatively, allow gamma to vary with the contribution ratio:

gamma_effective = gamma * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp))

This again uses existing data to modulate gamma, making it context-dependent without adding parameters. This could help gamma capture varying baseline acceptance based on contribution, improving its recovery.

Combining these ideas, the model could be:

U = beta * deviation + gamma * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp))

Where deviation is split_self minus the weighted fairness reference. This ties gamma to the contribution ratio, potentially making it more identifiable.

Alternatively, both beta and gamma could be modulated:

U = (beta * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp))) * deviation + gamma

This way, beta's sensitivity and gamma's baseline",0.2503197969935469,0.9253632567772655,0.7046325593213463,

Okay, let's look at the previous run results. The average BIC was 33.60, which is okay but could be lower. The accuracy was around 0.795, which is decent but there's room for improvement. The parameter recovery for alpha was really good (r=0.904), but beta was low (0.388) and gamma was moderate (0.681). So the main issues are beta's recovery and possibly the model's complexity affecting BIC.

The previous instructions suggested decoupling magnitude and direction sensitivity, using dynamic fairness weighting, and diminishing sensitivity. The model likely had parameters alpha, beta, theta. But beta's recovery was poor. Maybe the model structure is causing beta and theta to be confounded. For example, if beta is scaling the magnitude and theta is a penalty for negative deviations, there might be collinearity if the data doesn't have enough variation in positive vs negative deviations.

To improve beta's recovery, perhaps make the model's components more orthogonal. For instance, use separate parameters for positive and negative deviations. But with three parameters, maybe split beta into beta_plus and beta_minus, and drop theta. However, that would require a fourth parameter. Alternatively, use a single beta for magnitude and theta as a directional multiplier, not just a penalty. For example, U = beta * |deviation| + theta * deviation. This way, theta scales linearly with the deviation's sign, allowing for asymmetric sensitivity. This might help in distinguishing beta and theta's effects.

Another angle: The dynamic weighting of alpha using token_self/(token_self + token_opp) might not be the best approach. Maybe instead, use a sigmoid function to make alpha depend on the contribution ratio. For example, alpha_effective = sigmoid(alpha * (token_self - token_opp)). This introduces a nonlinear relationship, which could better capture how participants adjust their fairness expectations based on contribution differences. However, this would still use alpha as a learnable parameter without adding new ones.

Also, the diminishing sensitivity via log(1 + |deviation|) might not be the best transformation. Maybe use a power function with an exponent parameter. But that adds another parameter. Alternatively, use sqrt(|deviation|) which is a common way to model diminishing returns. This could help in better capturing the nonlinear utility perception without extra parameters.

Additionally, the previous model might not account for the total combined earning's effect beyond the 50% split. Perhaps participants have a different equality reference, like a fixed amount instead of a percentage. But integrating that would require more parameters. Alternatively, let the equality term be a parameter, but that's beyond the three-parameter limit.

To address beta's poor recovery, maybe introduce a non-linear interaction between beta and the deviation's direction. For example, U = beta * |deviation| * (1 + theta * (deviation < 0)). Here, theta scales the sensitivity for negative deviations, allowing beta to represent the base sensitivity and theta the multiplicative penalty. This could disentangle their effects.

Another idea: Include an interaction term between alpha and the deviation. For example, U = beta * |deviation| + theta * (deviation < 0) + gamma * alpha * deviation. This introduces a new parameter gamma, but we need to stay within three. So maybe replace theta with a term that combines direction and alpha's effect.

Alternatively, model the utility as a piecewise linear function with different slopes for positive and negative deviations. For example, U = beta_plus * max(deviation, 0) + beta_minus * min(deviation, 0) + gamma. But this requires two beta parameters. To fit within three parameters, replace gamma with beta_minus, making it U = beta_plus * max(deviation, 0) + beta_minus * min(deviation, 0). But then we lose the baseline bias. Hmm.

Wait, the previous model used theta as a penalty for negative deviations. If beta is the magnitude sensitivity and theta is the directional penalty, perhaps the model is U = beta * |deviation| + theta * (deviation < 0). But this might not capture the varying degrees of negative deviations. A continuous interaction might be better, like U = beta * deviation + theta * (deviation < 0) * |deviation|. This way, theta scales the impact of negative deviations proportionally. But this complicates the model.

Alternatively, use a rectified linear model: U = beta * deviation + theta * min(deviation, 0). This allows beta to capture the linear effect of deviation, and theta adds an extra penalty when the deviation is negative. This could help in separating the effects of beta and theta.

In summary, the key adjustments for the next run should focus on:

1. Improving parameter identifiability by restructuring the model to reduce collinearity between beta and theta.
2. Enhancing the dynamic weighting of alpha using a nonlinear function based on contribution ratios.
3. Experimenting with different transformations for diminishing sensitivity, such as square root instead of log.
4. Introducing asymmetric sensitivity to positive and negative deviations in a way that clearly separates the roles of beta and theta.

By implementing these changes, the model should achieve better parameter recovery (especially for beta and theta), lower BIC through improved fit, and higher accuracy by capturing more nuanced decision processes.

**Instructions for Run 7:**  
Design a model that **explicitly models asymmetric sensitivity to over/under-fair offers** while **nonlinearly anchoring fairness expectations to contribution ratios**. Use these strategies:  

1. **Dynamic α Anchoring:**  
   Replace static α weighting with:  
   `α_effective = σ(θ * (token_self - token_opp))`  
   where σ is the logistic function, tying fairness expectations *directly to contribution asymmetry* (θ ∈ [-5,5]).  

2. **Valence-Specific Utility:**  
   Split utility into two orthogonal components:  
   ```  
   U = β_over * max(deviation,0) + β_under * min(deviation,0)  
   ```  
   where β_over ∈ [0,10] controls sensitivity to generous offers and β_under ∈ [-10,0] penalizes unfair offers.  

3. **Prospect-Theoretic Transformation:**  
   Apply concave utility for gains and convex utility for losses:  
   ```  
   U = sign(deviation) * (|deviation|^γ)  
   ```  
   with γ ∈ [0.3,1] capturing diminishing sensitivity to large deviations.  

**Constraints:**  
- Use exactly 3 parameters: θ (fairness anchoring), β_over (gain sensitivity), γ (curvature)  
- No baseline bias terms to force identifiability  
- Bounds: θ ∈ [-5,5], β_over ∈ [0,10], γ ∈ [0.3,1]  

**Goal:** Achieve β_over/β_under recovery r > 0.85 while keeping BIC < 32. Test if γ < 1 improves fit compared to linear models.",0.749658110696912,,,0.6476616314667837
