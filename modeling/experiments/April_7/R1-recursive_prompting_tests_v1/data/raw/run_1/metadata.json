      "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts whether a participant (as the responder) accepts or rejects a proposal in the given experiment. The model needs to focus on responder behavior, use the provided dataset variables appropriately, and ensure that parameters can be recovered, which is as important as accuracy. Also, the utility function should predict probabilities with a logistic function, where utility less than 0 corresponds to less than 50% chance of acceptance.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key variables involved. The target variable is \"accept\", which is binary (1 or 0). The model should predict this based on the utility of the proposed split. The dataset includes variables like token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, split_self, split_opp, etc. Since the task involves fairness considerations, the model should account for how the participant perceives the fairness of the split relative to their own contribution and the opponent's.\n\nThe main psychological mechanisms here are likely fairness considerations and self-interest. Participants might compare the proposed split to what they consider a fair share based on their contribution (token_self) versus the opponent's (token_opp). If the proposed split is perceived as unfair, they might reject it even if it means getting nothing. So, the utility function should incorporate both the monetary gain (split_self) and a fairness term.\n\nLet's think about the fairness component. A common approach is to use inequity aversion, where individuals prefer equitable outcomes. The fair share could be calculated based on the ratio of tokens contributed by the participant. For example, if the participant contributed token_self tokens and the opponent contributed token_opp, the total tokens are token_self + token_opp. The fair percentage would be token_self / (token_self + token_opp). The proposed percentage is splitperc_self. The difference between these could be a measure of unfairness.\n\nSo, the utility might be a function of the proposed split (split_self) minus some fairness term. The fairness term could involve a parameter (like alpha) that scales the impact of unfairness. If the proposed split is less than the fair share, the utility decreases, making rejection more likely.\n\nAnother consideration is the efficiency of the split. The combined_earning is the total pot, so the absolute amount might matter. However, since split_self is already in pounds, maybe the model can use that directly. But the fairness term should be relative to contributions.\n\nPutting this together, the utility (U) could be:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * (fair_share - split_self)\n\nBut wait, fair_share would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. However, combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), since each token is \u00a33. So, combined_earning = 3*(token_self + token_opp). Therefore, the fair share in pounds would be 3*token_self. Because if each token is \u00a33, then the participant's contribution is worth 3*token_self, and the opponent's is 3*token_opp. The total combined earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So, the fair split for the participant would be 3*token_self, and for the opponent 3*token_opp. But the proposed split_self might differ from this.\n\nSo, the fairness term could be the difference between the proposed split_self and the fair share (3*token_self). If the proposed amount is less than fair, the participant feels negative utility. Alternatively, the ratio of proposed to fair share could be considered. But using the difference might be more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, the model could use the percentage split. The fair percentage would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The proposed percentage is splitperc_self. The difference between these percentages could be multiplied by some parameter to affect utility.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model the utility as the monetary gain (split_self) plus a term that represents the disutility from unfairness. The disutility could be proportional to the difference between the proposed split and the fair split. For example:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * max(fair_share - split_self, 0) - beta * max(split_self - fair_share, 0)\n\nHere, alpha penalizes offers below the fair share, and beta could penalize or reward offers above (if beta is negative, maybe). But since the responder is deciding to accept or reject, perhaps only offers below the fair share are penalized. Alternatively, the model could use a single parameter for inequity aversion, considering both under and over offers, but that might complicate things. However, given the parameter recovery requirement, it's better to keep the number of parameters low.\n\nAlternatively, using a quadratic term for the difference between proposed and fair share. But that might not be necessary. Let's stick to a linear term.\n\nAnother angle: the participant's utility could depend on both their own payoff and the opponent's. For example, if they care about relative payoffs, they might dislike inequality. So, U = split_self - alpha * (split_opp - split_self). But split_opp is the opponent's proposed share. However, in the responder role, the participant is evaluating the proposer's offer. The proposer's split_opp is their own share, and split_self is what's offered to the participant. Wait, no: when the participant is the responder, the proposer is the opponent. So, in the responder's case, split_self is the amount offered to the participant, and split_opp is the amount the proposer would keep. So, the total combined_earning is split_self + split_opp. The participant might compare their split to the proposer's split. Inequity aversion models often use terms like (split_opp - split_self) to capture disadvantageous inequality. So, the utility could be:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * max(split_opp - split_self, 0) - beta * max(split_self - split_opp, 0)\n\nHere, alpha is the aversion to disadvantageous inequality (when the opponent gets more), and beta is aversion to advantageous inequality (when the participant gets more). But in many models, beta is smaller than alpha. However, including both parameters might increase the number of learnable parameters, which could complicate parameter recovery. Since the task says to have a slight bias for fewer parameters, maybe we can simplify. For responder behavior, perhaps only disadvantageous inequality matters. So, U = split_self - alpha * max(split_opp - split_self, 0). This way, if the opponent is getting more, the participant's utility decreases.\n\nBut another consideration is the fair share based on contributions. The participant's fair share is 3*token_self, and the opponent's is 3*token_opp. The total combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). The proposed split_self might be compared to this fair share. So, the difference between split_self and 3*token_self could be a factor. For example, if the participant contributed more tokens, they might expect a higher split. So, the utility could be:\n\nU = split_self + gamma * (split_self - 3*token_self)\n\nHere, gamma is a parameter that scales how much deviations from the fair share affect utility. If gamma is positive, getting more than fair increases utility, less than fair decreases it. But this might not capture the rejection of unfair offers where the participant is getting less than fair. Alternatively, the disutility could be proportional to the difference when split_self is less than fair. So:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nThis way, if the offered split_self is less than what they contributed (3*token_self), the utility is reduced by alpha times that deficit. This captures the idea that participants are averse to receiving less than their fair share based on their contribution.\n\nAlternatively, combining both inequity aversion (compared to the opponent's split) and contribution-based fairness. For example:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * max(split_opp - split_self, 0) - beta * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nBut this introduces two parameters, alpha and beta. However, the problem states that parameter recovery is important, so having two parameters might be manageable if they are not highly correlated. But perhaps a better approach is to combine these into a single term. For example, the fair share based on contributions is 3*token_self, and the proposed split_self is compared to that. The difference (fair_share - split_self) when positive would reduce utility. Additionally, the ratio of the opponent's split to their own contribution (split_opp / (3*token_opp)) could be compared to the participant's ratio (split_self / (3*token_self)). If the opponent is getting a better ratio, that might cause disutility.\n\nBut this could get complicated. Let's simplify. The key is that the participant's perception of fairness depends on both their own contribution and the split. The model should capture this.\n\nAnother approach is to compute the fair percentage as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The proposed percentage is splitperc_self. The difference between these could be a measure of unfairness. So, delta = splitperc_self - fair_percentage. If delta is negative, the offer is unfair (participant gets less than fair share), which reduces utility. So:\n\nU = split_self + theta * delta\n\nBut delta could be negative. Alternatively, U = split_self + theta * (splitperc_self - fair_percentage). Here, theta is a parameter that determines how sensitive the participant is to percentage deviations from the fair split. If theta is positive, higher than fair percentages increase utility, lower decrease it. But since split_self is in pounds, combining it with a percentage term might require scaling. Alternatively, perhaps the percentage term should be normalized. Alternatively, use the difference in percentages multiplied by the combined_earning to make it in the same units as split_self. For example:\n\nfair_share_pct = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100\ndelta_pct = splitperc_self - fair_share_pct\nU = split_self + theta * (delta_pct / 100) * combined_earning\n\nThis way, delta_pct is the percentage difference, converted to a proportion (by dividing by 100), then multiplied by the total to get a monetary equivalent. So theta would represent the weight given to fairness in monetary terms. For example, if the split is 5% less than fair, that's a delta_pct of -5, which becomes -0.05 when divided by 100, multiplied by combined_earning (say, 100), gives -5. So theta * (-5) would reduce the utility by 5*theta. This makes the fairness term in the same units as split_self (pounds), so theta is unitless and represents the weight of fairness relative to monetary gain.\n\nThis seems promising. So the utility function would be:\n\nU = split_self + theta * ((splitperc_self - fair_share_pct) / 100) * combined_earning\n\nBut fair_share_pct is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. So simplifying:\n\nfair_share_pct = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100\ndelta_pct = splitperc_self - fair_share_pct\nU = split_self + theta * (delta_pct / 100) * combined_earning\n\nBut combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So substituting:\n\nU = split_self + theta * (delta_pct / 100) * 3*(token_self + token_opp)\n\nBut delta_pct is splitperc_self - (token_self/(token_self + token_opp))*100. Let's compute delta_pct:\n\ndelta_pct = splitperc_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100\n\nSo substituting into U:\n\nU = split_self + theta * [splitperc_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp))*100] * 3*(token_self + token_opp)/100\n\nSimplify the term:\n\n[splitperc_self - (token_self/(token_self + token_opp))*100] * 3*(token_self + token_opp)/100\n\nLet's compute this:\n\n= [splitperc_self * 3*(token_self + token_opp)/100 - (token_self/(token_self + token_opp))*100 * 3*(token_self + token_opp)/100 ]\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\n(token_self/(token_self + token_opp))*100 * 3*(token_self + token_opp)/100 = 3*token_self\n\nSo the entire term becomes:\n\nsplitperc_self * 3*(token_self + token_opp)/100 - 3*token_self\n\nBut splitperc_self is the percentage of the combined_earning offered to the participant. So split_self = (splitperc_self / 100) * combined_earning. Since combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), split_self = (splitperc_self / 100) * 3*(token_self + token_opp). Therefore, the first term in the brackets is split_self. So the entire term simplifies to split_self - 3*token_self. Therefore, the utility function becomes:\n\nU = split_self + theta * (split_self - 3*token_self)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nU = split_self * (1 + theta) - 3*theta*token_self\n\nWait, that's interesting. So this approach reduces the utility to a linear combination of split_self and token_self. But this might not capture the intended fairness component properly. Let me check the math again.\n\nOriginal U expression:\n\nU = split_self + theta * [ (splitperc_self - fair_share_pct) / 100 * combined_earning ]\n\nBut split_self = (splitperc_self / 100) * combined_earning\n\nSimilarly, fair_share_pct is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100, so fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning = 3*token_self.\n\nTherefore, the term [ (splitperc_self - fair_share_pct) / 100 * combined_earning ] is equal to split_self - fair_share.\n\nSo the utility simplifies to:\n\nU = split_self + theta * (split_self - fair_share)\n\nWhich is:\n\nU = split_self + theta*(split_self - 3*token_self)\n\n= split_self*(1 + theta) - 3*theta*token_self\n\nBut this seems to suggest that the utility is a linear function of split_self and token_self. However, theta here represents the sensitivity to deviations from the fair share. If theta is positive, then getting more than the fair share (split_self > 3*token_self) increases utility, and less decreases it. But this might not capture the idea that participants reject offers that are below their fair share, even if it's a small amount. For example, if theta is positive, then a split_self less than fair_share would subtract from utility, making U lower, thus lower probability of acceptance.\n\nBut this model has U as a linear function of split_self and token_self. However, the problem states that the utility should be such that when U < 0, the probability is less than 50%. Wait, the model's utility will be passed through a logistic function to get the probability. So the actual probability is 1 / (1 + exp(-U)). So if U is negative, the probability is less than 0.5. So the model needs to compute U such that when the offer is unfair (split_self < fair_share), U decreases, possibly becoming negative.\n\nBut in the current formulation, U could be positive or negative based on split_self and token_self. For example, if theta is positive, then when split_self is less than fair_share, the term theta*(split_self - fair_share) is negative, reducing U. So U = split_self + (negative term). If split_self is small enough, U could be negative.\n\nBut perhaps this model is sufficient. Let's test with an example. Suppose theta is 1. Then U = split_self + (split_self - 3*token_self) = 2*split_self - 3*token_self. If the fair share is 3*token_self, then if split_self equals fair_share, U = 3*token_self. If split_self is half of fair_share, say 1.5*token_self, then U = 3*token_self - 3*token_self = 0. So the probability would be 0.5. If split_self is less than fair_share, U becomes negative. For example, split_self = 2*token_self: U = 2*2*token_self -3*token_self = token_self. Wait, that's positive. Hmm, maybe my example is flawed.\n\nWait, let's take concrete numbers. Suppose token_self = 10, token_opp = 10. Then fair_share is 3*10 = \u00a330. combined_earning is 3*(10+10)=60. Suppose split_self is \u00a320 (so splitperc_self is 33.33%). Then U = 20 + theta*(20 -30) = 20 -10*theta. If theta is 2, then U=20-20=0. Probability is 0.5. If theta is 3, U=20-30= -10, probability is ~0.000045, which is very low. But if theta is 1, U=10, probability ~0.99995. Wait, this seems counterintuitive. If theta is positive, then when split_self is less than fair_share, the utility decreases. But in this example, with theta=1, split_self=20, fair_share=30, U=20 + (20-30)*1 = 10. Wait, that's 20 -10 =10. So U is positive, leading to high probability of acceptance. But that's not desired. Because the participant is getting less than their fair share, but the model predicts high acceptance. That's a problem.\n\nAh, I see the mistake here. The term (split_self - fair_share) is negative when split_self < fair_share. So theta multiplied by a negative term. If theta is positive, then the entire term is negative, reducing U. But in the example above, U = split_self + theta*(split_self - fair_share) = 20 + 1*(20-30) = 20 -10 =10. Wait, that's still positive. So even though the offer is below fair, U is positive. That's because split_self itself is \u00a320, which is a positive amount. So the model would predict acceptance even when the offer is below fair, as long as U is positive. But in reality, participants might reject offers that are below their fair share even if the absolute amount is positive. So this model might not capture that behavior correctly.\n\nThis suggests that the model needs a different formulation. Perhaps the disutility is proportional to the difference between fair_share and split_self, but scaled by a parameter. For example:\n\nU = split_self - alpha*(fair_share - split_self)\n\nThis way, if split_self is less than fair_share, the term (fair_share - split_self) is positive, and multiplied by alpha (a positive parameter), reducing U. So U = split_self - alpha*(fair_share - split_self) = split_self*(1 + alpha) - alpha*fair_share.\n\nIn this case, if split_self is less than fair_share, U decreases. Let's test with numbers. Suppose fair_share=30, split_self=20, alpha=1. Then U=20 -1*(10) =10. Still positive. If alpha=2, U=20 -2*10=0. Probability 0.5. If alpha=3, U=20-30= -10, probability ~0. So in this case, higher alpha leads to higher sensitivity to unfairness. But even with alpha=1, the utility is positive, leading to acceptance. So participants would accept any positive offer unless alpha is sufficiently high. But in reality, people might reject offers that are significantly below fair even if they are positive. So perhaps the model needs a non-linear term, but the problem states that the model should be applicable for parameter recovery, which is easier with linear models.\n\nAlternatively, include a reference point. Maybe the utility is split_self compared to the fair_share, with a non-linear function. But to keep it simple, perhaps the model should have a parameter that acts as a threshold. For example, participants reject offers below a certain proportion of the fair_share. But that would require a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, model the utility as the difference between split_self and the fair_share, scaled by a parameter. For example:\n\nU = split_self - alpha*(fair_share - split_self)\n\nBut this is the same as before. Let's see: if alpha is 0, U is just split_self. As alpha increases, the disutility of being below fair_share increases. For a given split_self, higher alpha makes U lower. So for a participant with high alpha, even a small deficit from fair_share would make U negative, leading to rejection.\n\nIn the previous example with split_self=20, fair_share=30:\n\nIf alpha=0.5: U=20 -0.5*10=15 \u2192 probability ~1.0\n\nIf alpha=1: U=10 \u2192 probability ~0.99995\n\nIf alpha=2: U=0 \u2192 probability 0.5\n\nIf alpha=3: U=-10 \u2192 probability ~0\n\nSo for alpha >=2, the participant would reject the offer of 20 when fair_share is 30. But in reality, people might have varying thresholds. However, this model allows alpha to be learned, and with alpha being a learnable parameter, it can capture different sensitivities.\n\nAnother consideration is the efficiency: the total combined_earning. If the total is large, maybe participants are more willing to accept slightly unfair offers. But in the current model, combined_earning is already factored into split_self and fair_share. For example, if token_self and token_opp are higher, leading to higher combined_earning, the fair_share and split_self scale accordingly. So the model already accounts for that.\n\nSo, the proposed model is:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * (fair_share - split_self)\n\nWhere fair_share = 3 * token_self\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\nU = split_self * (1 + alpha) - alpha * 3 * token_self\n\nBut to make it clearer, perhaps keep it as:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * (3 * token_self - split_self)\n\nThis way, when split_self is less than 3*token_self, the term (3*token_self - split_self) is positive, reducing U. The parameter alpha determines how much this deficit affects utility.\n\nNow, the probability of acceptance is logistic(U). So when U >=0, probability >=0.5; when U <0, probability <0.5.\n\nThis model has one learnable parameter, alpha, which should be bounded between 0 and some upper limit. Since alpha scales the disutility of receiving less than the fair share, it's reasonable to bound it. For example, if alpha is 0, the participant only cares about their own split. If alpha is 2, then each pound deficit from fair_share reduces utility by 2 pounds. The upper bound should be generous but finite. Let's say alpha can range from 0 to 5. This allows for strong aversion to unfairness.\n\nAlternatively, maybe alpha can be any positive number, but for parameter recovery, it's better to have finite bounds. So setting alpha between 0 and 5, inclusive.\n\nAnother possible parameter is a baseline bias, like a constant term. For example, U = beta + split_self - alpha*(fair_share - split_self). Here, beta could capture a general tendency to accept or reject offers regardless of the terms. However, adding another parameter increases model complexity, which might affect parameter recovery. Since the priority is parameter recovery and accuracy equally, and the instruction says to have a slight bias for fewer parameters, it's better to start with one parameter, alpha. If including a beta term, it's two parameters. But perhaps the baseline tendency is important. For example, some participants might have a general tendency to reject offers (negative beta) or accept (positive beta). However, without a beta term, the model assumes that when U=0 (split_self = alpha/(1+alpha) * fair_share), the probability is 0.5. Including a beta term allows for a different baseline. But given the need to balance parameters, maybe start with just alpha.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the utility should also account for the absolute amount. For example, even if the offer is fair, a very small absolute amount might be rejected. But in the current model, if split_self equals fair_share, U = split_self, which is positive, leading to high probability of acceptance. But if the fair_share is very small (e.g., token_self=1, fair_share=3), and split_self=3, U=3, which is positive. But maybe participants reject small absolute amounts even if fair. To capture this, a beta term could be added: U = split_self - alpha*(fair_share - split_self) + beta. But this complicates the model. Alternatively, the model as is might be sufficient, with alpha capturing the trade-off between absolute and relative fairness.\n\nAnother angle: the utility could be the ratio of split_self to fair_share. For example, U = (split_self / fair_share) - alpha*(1 - (split_self / fair_share)). This would normalize the terms. But this introduces division, which could cause issues if fair_share is zero (but token_self is at least 1, since they found tokens). So fair_share=3*token_self, which is at least 3. So division is safe. Then:\n\nU = (split_self / fair_share) - alpha*(1 - (split_self / fair_share))\n\n= (split_self / fair_share)*(1 + alpha) - alpha\n\nThis is similar to the previous model but normalized. However, this might complicate interpretation. The previous model is in monetary terms, which is more straightforward.\n\nAfter considering these options, the simplest model with one learnable parameter alpha seems appropriate. It captures the trade-off between the offered amount and the fair share based on contribution. The utility decreases when the offer is below the fair share, with alpha determining the sensitivity. This model should be identifiable, as alpha can be estimated from how much participants reject offers below their fair share.\n\nNow, the mathematical model would be:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nWait, using max ensures that only deficits from the fair share are penalized. If the offer is above the fair share, there's no penalty. But in the previous formulation, the term is (3*token_self - split_self), which is multiplied by alpha regardless of the sign. Using max(3*token_self - split_self, 0) ensures that only when split_self < fair_share, the penalty is applied. This might better capture the idea that participants are only averse to receiving less than their fair share, not to receiving more. However, in some cases, participants might reject offers that are too generous if they feel guilt, but this is less common. For simplicity, we'll assume that only deficits are penalized.\n\nSo the model becomes:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nThis way, if split_self >= 3*token_self, U = split_self. If split_self < 3*token_self, U = split_self - alpha*(3*token_self - split_self) = split_self*(1 + alpha) - alpha*3*token_self.\n\nThis formulation ensures that the penalty only applies when the offer is below the fair share. This might better capture the rejection behavior for unfair offers.\n\nTesting this model with an example: token_self=10, fair_share=30. If split_self=20, then U=20 - alpha*(10). If alpha=1, U=10 \u2192 probability ~0.99995 (accept). If alpha=2, U=0 \u2192 probability 0.5. If alpha=3, U=-10 \u2192 probability ~0 (reject). This aligns with the intuition that higher alpha leads to higher likelihood of rejecting offers below the fair share.\n\nAnother example: split_self=30 (fair share), U=30, regardless of alpha. Probability ~1.0. If split_self=40, U=40, which is higher, leading to even higher acceptance probability. This makes sense as the offer is more than fair.\n\nThis model has one learnable parameter, alpha, which should be bounded. Since alpha represents the penalty per unit deficit, it can't be negative (as a negative alpha would imply that participants prefer offers below their fair share). So alpha's range is [0, upper_bound]. To set a generous upper bound, perhaps 5. This allows for cases where a \u00a31 deficit reduces utility by \u00a35, making rejection very likely even for small deficits.\n\nTherefore, the final model is:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nThis model uses split_self and token_self from the dataset. The variable 3*token_self is calculated as the fair share. The parameter alpha is learnable with bounds [0,5].\n\nNow, the variables section needs to describe each variable in the model. The variables involved are:\n\n- split_self: from the data, float64.\n- token_self: from the data, int64.\n- alpha: learnable parameter, range [0,5].\n- U: calculated utility.\n\nThe target variable is \"accept\", which is predicted via the logistic function applied to U.\n\nSo the variables JSON would include:\n\n- split_self: source data, not learnable.\n- token_self: source data, not learnable.\n- alpha: learnable, range [0,5].\n- U: calculated.\n\nThe model formula is enclosed in <MODEL> tags, and variables described in <VARIABLES>.\n</think>\n\nI have recieved the test instructions\n\n<MODEL>\nU = split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed monetary share for the participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant (contribution measure)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fairness sensitivity parameter: penalty per \u00a3 deficit from fair share (3 * token_self)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposal\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>accept</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA fairness-driven utility model where participants evaluate offers relative to their contribution-based fair share (3 * token_self).

  "full_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts whether a participant (as the responder) accepts or rejects a proposal in the given experiment. The model needs to focus on responder behavior, use the provided dataset variables appropriately, and ensure that parameters can be recovered, which is as important as accuracy. Also, the utility function should predict probabilities with a logistic function, where utility less than 0 corresponds to less than 50% chance of acceptance.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key variables involved. The target variable is \"accept\", which is binary (1 or 0). The model should predict this based on the utility of the proposed split. The dataset includes variables like token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, split_self, split_opp, etc. Since the task involves fairness considerations, the model should account for how the participant perceives the fairness of the split relative to their own contribution and the opponent's.\n\nThe main psychological mechanisms here are likely fairness considerations and self-interest. Participants might compare the proposed split to what they consider a fair share based on their contribution (token_self) versus the opponent's (token_opp). If the proposed split is perceived as unfair, they might reject it even if it means getting nothing. So, the utility function should incorporate both the monetary gain (split_self) and a fairness term.\n\nLet's think about the fairness component. A common approach is to use inequity aversion, where individuals prefer equitable outcomes. The fair share could be calculated based on the ratio of tokens contributed by the participant. For example, if the participant contributed token_self tokens and the opponent contributed token_opp, the total tokens are token_self + token_opp. The fair percentage would be token_self / (token_self + token_opp). The proposed percentage is splitperc_self. The difference between these could be a measure of unfairness.\n\nSo, the utility might be a function of the proposed split (split_self) minus some fairness term. The fairness term could involve a parameter (like alpha) that scales the impact of unfairness. If the proposed split is less than the fair share, the utility decreases, making rejection more likely.\n\nAnother consideration is the efficiency of the split. The combined_earning is the total pot, so the absolute amount might matter. However, since split_self is already in pounds, maybe the model can use that directly. But the fairness term should be relative to contributions.\n\nPutting this together, the utility (U) could be:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * (fair_share - split_self)\n\nBut wait, fair_share would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. However, combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), since each token is \u00a33. So, combined_earning = 3*(token_self + token_opp). Therefore, the fair share in pounds would be 3*token_self. Because if each token is \u00a33, then the participant's contribution is worth 3*token_self, and the opponent's is 3*token_opp. The total combined earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So, the fair split for the participant would be 3*token_self, and for the opponent 3*token_opp. But the proposed split_self might differ from this.\n\nSo, the fairness term could be the difference between the proposed split_self and the fair share (3*token_self). If the proposed amount is less than fair, the participant feels negative utility. Alternatively, the ratio of proposed to fair share could be considered. But using the difference might be more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, the model could use the percentage split. The fair percentage would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The proposed percentage is splitperc_self. The difference between these percentages could be multiplied by some parameter to affect utility.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model the utility as the monetary gain (split_self) plus a term that represents the disutility from unfairness. The disutility could be proportional to the difference between the proposed split and the fair split. For example:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * max(fair_share - split_self, 0) - beta * max(split_self - fair_share, 0)\n\nHere, alpha penalizes offers below the fair share, and beta could penalize or reward offers above (if beta is negative, maybe). But since the responder is deciding to accept or reject, perhaps only offers below the fair share are penalized. Alternatively, the model could use a single parameter for inequity aversion, considering both under and over offers, but that might complicate things. However, given the parameter recovery requirement, it's better to keep the number of parameters low.\n\nAlternatively, using a quadratic term for the difference between proposed and fair share. But that might not be necessary. Let's stick to a linear term.\n\nAnother angle: the participant's utility could depend on both their own payoff and the opponent's. For example, if they care about relative payoffs, they might dislike inequality. So, U = split_self - alpha * (split_opp - split_self). But split_opp is the opponent's proposed share. However, in the responder role, the participant is evaluating the proposer's offer. The proposer's split_opp is their own share, and split_self is what's offered to the participant. Wait, no: when the participant is the responder, the proposer is the opponent. So, in the responder's case, split_self is the amount offered to the participant, and split_opp is the amount the proposer would keep. So, the total combined_earning is split_self + split_opp. The participant might compare their split to the proposer's split. Inequity aversion models often use terms like (split_opp - split_self) to capture disadvantageous inequality. So, the utility could be:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * max(split_opp - split_self, 0) - beta * max(split_self - split_opp, 0)\n\nHere, alpha is the aversion to disadvantageous inequality (when the opponent gets more), and beta is aversion to advantageous inequality (when the participant gets more). But in many models, beta is smaller than alpha. However, including both parameters might increase the number of learnable parameters, which could complicate parameter recovery. Since the task says to have a slight bias for fewer parameters, maybe we can simplify. For responder behavior, perhaps only disadvantageous inequality matters. So, U = split_self - alpha * max(split_opp - split_self, 0). This way, if the opponent is getting more, the participant's utility decreases.\n\nBut another consideration is the fair share based on contributions. The participant's fair share is 3*token_self, and the opponent's is 3*token_opp. The total combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). The proposed split_self might be compared to this fair share. So, the difference between split_self and 3*token_self could be a factor. For example, if the participant contributed more tokens, they might expect a higher split. So, the utility could be:\n\nU = split_self + gamma * (split_self - 3*token_self)\n\nHere, gamma is a parameter that scales how much deviations from the fair share affect utility. If gamma is positive, getting more than fair increases utility, less than fair decreases it. But this might not capture the rejection of unfair offers where the participant is getting less than fair. Alternatively, the disutility could be proportional to the difference when split_self is less than fair. So:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nThis way, if the offered split_self is less than what they contributed (3*token_self), the utility is reduced by alpha times that deficit. This captures the idea that participants are averse to receiving less than their fair share based on their contribution.\n\nAlternatively, combining both inequity aversion (compared to the opponent's split) and contribution-based fairness. For example:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * max(split_opp - split_self, 0) - beta * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nBut this introduces two parameters, alpha and beta. However, the problem states that parameter recovery is important, so having two parameters might be manageable if they are not highly correlated. But perhaps a better approach is to combine these into a single term. For example, the fair share based on contributions is 3*token_self, and the proposed split_self is compared to that. The difference (fair_share - split_self) when positive would reduce utility. Additionally, the ratio of the opponent's split to their own contribution (split_opp / (3*token_opp)) could be compared to the participant's ratio (split_self / (3*token_self)). If the opponent is getting a better ratio, that might cause disutility.\n\nBut this could get complicated. Let's simplify. The key is that the participant's perception of fairness depends on both their own contribution and the split. The model should capture this.\n\nAnother approach is to compute the fair percentage as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The proposed percentage is splitperc_self. The difference between these could be a measure of unfairness. So, delta = splitperc_self - fair_percentage. If delta is negative, the offer is unfair (participant gets less than fair share), which reduces utility. So:\n\nU = split_self + theta * delta\n\nBut delta could be negative. Alternatively, U = split_self + theta * (splitperc_self - fair_percentage). Here, theta is a parameter that determines how sensitive the participant is to percentage deviations from the fair split. If theta is positive, higher than fair percentages increase utility, lower decrease it. But since split_self is in pounds, combining it with a percentage term might require scaling. Alternatively, perhaps the percentage term should be normalized. Alternatively, use the difference in percentages multiplied by the combined_earning to make it in the same units as split_self. For example:\n\nfair_share_pct = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100\ndelta_pct = splitperc_self - fair_share_pct\nU = split_self + theta * (delta_pct / 100) * combined_earning\n\nThis way, delta_pct is the percentage difference, converted to a proportion (by dividing by 100), then multiplied by the total to get a monetary equivalent. So theta would represent the weight given to fairness in monetary terms. For example, if the split is 5% less than fair, that's a delta_pct of -5, which becomes -0.05 when divided by 100, multiplied by combined_earning (say, 100), gives -5. So theta * (-5) would reduce the utility by 5*theta. This makes the fairness term in the same units as split_self (pounds), so theta is unitless and represents the weight of fairness relative to monetary gain.\n\nThis seems promising. So the utility function would be:\n\nU = split_self + theta * ((splitperc_self - fair_share_pct) / 100) * combined_earning\n\nBut fair_share_pct is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. So simplifying:\n\nfair_share_pct = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100\ndelta_pct = splitperc_self - fair_share_pct\nU = split_self + theta * (delta_pct / 100) * combined_earning\n\nBut combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So substituting:\n\nU = split_self + theta * (delta_pct / 100) * 3*(token_self + token_opp)\n\nBut delta_pct is splitperc_self - (token_self/(token_self + token_opp))*100. Let's compute delta_pct:\n\ndelta_pct = splitperc_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100\n\nSo substituting into U:\n\nU = split_self + theta * [splitperc_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp))*100] * 3*(token_self + token_opp)/100\n\nSimplify the term:\n\n[splitperc_self - (token_self/(token_self + token_opp))*100] * 3*(token_self + token_opp)/100\n\nLet's compute this:\n\n= [splitperc_self * 3*(token_self + token_opp)/100 - (token_self/(token_self + token_opp))*100 * 3*(token_self + token_opp)/100 ]\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\n(token_self/(token_self + token_opp))*100 * 3*(token_self + token_opp)/100 = 3*token_self\n\nSo the entire term becomes:\n\nsplitperc_self * 3*(token_self + token_opp)/100 - 3*token_self\n\nBut splitperc_self is the percentage of the combined_earning offered to the participant. So split_self = (splitperc_self / 100) * combined_earning. Since combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), split_self = (splitperc_self / 100) * 3*(token_self + token_opp). Therefore, the first term in the brackets is split_self. So the entire term simplifies to split_self - 3*token_self. Therefore, the utility function becomes:\n\nU = split_self + theta * (split_self - 3*token_self)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nU = split_self * (1 + theta) - 3*theta*token_self\n\nWait, that's interesting. So this approach reduces the utility to a linear combination of split_self and token_self. But this might not capture the intended fairness component properly. Let me check the math again.\n\nOriginal U expression:\n\nU = split_self + theta * [ (splitperc_self - fair_share_pct) / 100 * combined_earning ]\n\nBut split_self = (splitperc_self / 100) * combined_earning\n\nSimilarly, fair_share_pct is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100, so fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning = 3*token_self.\n\nTherefore, the term [ (splitperc_self - fair_share_pct) / 100 * combined_earning ] is equal to split_self - fair_share.\n\nSo the utility simplifies to:\n\nU = split_self + theta * (split_self - fair_share)\n\nWhich is:\n\nU = split_self + theta*(split_self - 3*token_self)\n\n= split_self*(1 + theta) - 3*theta*token_self\n\nBut this seems to suggest that the utility is a linear function of split_self and token_self. However, theta here represents the sensitivity to deviations from the fair share. If theta is positive, then getting more than the fair share (split_self > 3*token_self) increases utility, and less decreases it. But this might not capture the idea that participants reject offers that are below their fair share, even if it's a small amount. For example, if theta is positive, then a split_self less than fair_share would subtract from utility, making U lower, thus lower probability of acceptance.\n\nBut this model has U as a linear function of split_self and token_self. However, the problem states that the utility should be such that when U < 0, the probability is less than 50%. Wait, the model's utility will be passed through a logistic function to get the probability. So the actual probability is 1 / (1 + exp(-U)). So if U is negative, the probability is less than 0.5. So the model needs to compute U such that when the offer is unfair (split_self < fair_share), U decreases, possibly becoming negative.\n\nBut in the current formulation, U could be positive or negative based on split_self and token_self. For example, if theta is positive, then when split_self is less than fair_share, the term theta*(split_self - fair_share) is negative, reducing U. So U = split_self + (negative term). If split_self is small enough, U could be negative.\n\nBut perhaps this model is sufficient. Let's test with an example. Suppose theta is 1. Then U = split_self + (split_self - 3*token_self) = 2*split_self - 3*token_self. If the fair share is 3*token_self, then if split_self equals fair_share, U = 3*token_self. If split_self is half of fair_share, say 1.5*token_self, then U = 3*token_self - 3*token_self = 0. So the probability would be 0.5. If split_self is less than fair_share, U becomes negative. For example, split_self = 2*token_self: U = 2*2*token_self -3*token_self = token_self. Wait, that's positive. Hmm, maybe my example is flawed.\n\nWait, let's take concrete numbers. Suppose token_self = 10, token_opp = 10. Then fair_share is 3*10 = \u00a330. combined_earning is 3*(10+10)=60. Suppose split_self is \u00a320 (so splitperc_self is 33.33%). Then U = 20 + theta*(20 -30) = 20 -10*theta. If theta is 2, then U=20-20=0. Probability is 0.5. If theta is 3, U=20-30= -10, probability is ~0.000045, which is very low. But if theta is 1, U=10, probability ~0.99995. Wait, this seems counterintuitive. If theta is positive, then when split_self is less than fair_share, the utility decreases. But in this example, with theta=1, split_self=20, fair_share=30, U=20 + (20-30)*1 = 10. Wait, that's 20 -10 =10. So U is positive, leading to high probability of acceptance. But that's not desired. Because the participant is getting less than their fair share, but the model predicts high acceptance. That's a problem.\n\nAh, I see the mistake here. The term (split_self - fair_share) is negative when split_self < fair_share. So theta multiplied by a negative term. If theta is positive, then the entire term is negative, reducing U. But in the example above, U = split_self + theta*(split_self - fair_share) = 20 + 1*(20-30) = 20 -10 =10. Wait, that's still positive. So even though the offer is below fair, U is positive. That's because split_self itself is \u00a320, which is a positive amount. So the model would predict acceptance even when the offer is below fair, as long as U is positive. But in reality, participants might reject offers that are below their fair share even if the absolute amount is positive. So this model might not capture that behavior correctly.\n\nThis suggests that the model needs a different formulation. Perhaps the disutility is proportional to the difference between fair_share and split_self, but scaled by a parameter. For example:\n\nU = split_self - alpha*(fair_share - split_self)\n\nThis way, if split_self is less than fair_share, the term (fair_share - split_self) is positive, and multiplied by alpha (a positive parameter), reducing U. So U = split_self - alpha*(fair_share - split_self) = split_self*(1 + alpha) - alpha*fair_share.\n\nIn this case, if split_self is less than fair_share, U decreases. Let's test with numbers. Suppose fair_share=30, split_self=20, alpha=1. Then U=20 -1*(10) =10. Still positive. If alpha=2, U=20 -2*10=0. Probability 0.5. If alpha=3, U=20-30= -10, probability ~0. So in this case, higher alpha leads to higher sensitivity to unfairness. But even with alpha=1, the utility is positive, leading to acceptance. So participants would accept any positive offer unless alpha is sufficiently high. But in reality, people might reject offers that are significantly below fair even if they are positive. So perhaps the model needs a non-linear term, but the problem states that the model should be applicable for parameter recovery, which is easier with linear models.\n\nAlternatively, include a reference point. Maybe the utility is split_self compared to the fair_share, with a non-linear function. But to keep it simple, perhaps the model should have a parameter that acts as a threshold. For example, participants reject offers below a certain proportion of the fair_share. But that would require a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, model the utility as the difference between split_self and the fair_share, scaled by a parameter. For example:\n\nU = split_self - alpha*(fair_share - split_self)\n\nBut this is the same as before. Let's see: if alpha is 0, U is just split_self. As alpha increases, the disutility of being below fair_share increases. For a given split_self, higher alpha makes U lower. So for a participant with high alpha, even a small deficit from fair_share would make U negative, leading to rejection.\n\nIn the previous example with split_self=20, fair_share=30:\n\nIf alpha=0.5: U=20 -0.5*10=15 \u2192 probability ~1.0\n\nIf alpha=1: U=10 \u2192 probability ~0.99995\n\nIf alpha=2: U=0 \u2192 probability 0.5\n\nIf alpha=3: U=-10 \u2192 probability ~0\n\nSo for alpha >=2, the participant would reject the offer of 20 when fair_share is 30. But in reality, people might have varying thresholds. However, this model allows alpha to be learned, and with alpha being a learnable parameter, it can capture different sensitivities.\n\nAnother consideration is the efficiency: the total combined_earning. If the total is large, maybe participants are more willing to accept slightly unfair offers. But in the current model, combined_earning is already factored into split_self and fair_share. For example, if token_self and token_opp are higher, leading to higher combined_earning, the fair_share and split_self scale accordingly. So the model already accounts for that.\n\nSo, the proposed model is:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * (fair_share - split_self)\n\nWhere fair_share = 3 * token_self\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\nU = split_self * (1 + alpha) - alpha * 3 * token_self\n\nBut to make it clearer, perhaps keep it as:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * (3 * token_self - split_self)\n\nThis way, when split_self is less than 3*token_self, the term (3*token_self - split_self) is positive, reducing U. The parameter alpha determines how much this deficit affects utility.\n\nNow, the probability of acceptance is logistic(U). So when U >=0, probability >=0.5; when U <0, probability <0.5.\n\nThis model has one learnable parameter, alpha, which should be bounded between 0 and some upper limit. Since alpha scales the disutility of receiving less than the fair share, it's reasonable to bound it. For example, if alpha is 0, the participant only cares about their own split. If alpha is 2, then each pound deficit from fair_share reduces utility by 2 pounds. The upper bound should be generous but finite. Let's say alpha can range from 0 to 5. This allows for strong aversion to unfairness.\n\nAlternatively, maybe alpha can be any positive number, but for parameter recovery, it's better to have finite bounds. So setting alpha between 0 and 5, inclusive.\n\nAnother possible parameter is a baseline bias, like a constant term. For example, U = beta + split_self - alpha*(fair_share - split_self). Here, beta could capture a general tendency to accept or reject offers regardless of the terms. However, adding another parameter increases model complexity, which might affect parameter recovery. Since the priority is parameter recovery and accuracy equally, and the instruction says to have a slight bias for fewer parameters, it's better to start with one parameter, alpha. If including a beta term, it's two parameters. But perhaps the baseline tendency is important. For example, some participants might have a general tendency to reject offers (negative beta) or accept (positive beta). However, without a beta term, the model assumes that when U=0 (split_self = alpha/(1+alpha) * fair_share), the probability is 0.5. Including a beta term allows for a different baseline. But given the need to balance parameters, maybe start with just alpha.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the utility should also account for the absolute amount. For example, even if the offer is fair, a very small absolute amount might be rejected. But in the current model, if split_self equals fair_share, U = split_self, which is positive, leading to high probability of acceptance. But if the fair_share is very small (e.g., token_self=1, fair_share=3), and split_self=3, U=3, which is positive. But maybe participants reject small absolute amounts even if fair. To capture this, a beta term could be added: U = split_self - alpha*(fair_share - split_self) + beta. But this complicates the model. Alternatively, the model as is might be sufficient, with alpha capturing the trade-off between absolute and relative fairness.\n\nAnother angle: the utility could be the ratio of split_self to fair_share. For example, U = (split_self / fair_share) - alpha*(1 - (split_self / fair_share)). This would normalize the terms. But this introduces division, which could cause issues if fair_share is zero (but token_self is at least 1, since they found tokens). So fair_share=3*token_self, which is at least 3. So division is safe. Then:\n\nU = (split_self / fair_share) - alpha*(1 - (split_self / fair_share))\n\n= (split_self / fair_share)*(1 + alpha) - alpha\n\nThis is similar to the previous model but normalized. However, this might complicate interpretation. The previous model is in monetary terms, which is more straightforward.\n\nAfter considering these options, the simplest model with one learnable parameter alpha seems appropriate. It captures the trade-off between the offered amount and the fair share based on contribution. The utility decreases when the offer is below the fair share, with alpha determining the sensitivity. This model should be identifiable, as alpha can be estimated from how much participants reject offers below their fair share.\n\nNow, the mathematical model would be:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nWait, using max ensures that only deficits from the fair share are penalized. If the offer is above the fair share, there's no penalty. But in the previous formulation, the term is (3*token_self - split_self), which is multiplied by alpha regardless of the sign. Using max(3*token_self - split_self, 0) ensures that only when split_self < fair_share, the penalty is applied. This might better capture the idea that participants are only averse to receiving less than their fair share, not to receiving more. However, in some cases, participants might reject offers that are too generous if they feel guilt, but this is less common. For simplicity, we'll assume that only deficits are penalized.\n\nSo the model becomes:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nThis way, if split_self >= 3*token_self, U = split_self. If split_self < 3*token_self, U = split_self - alpha*(3*token_self - split_self) = split_self*(1 + alpha) - alpha*3*token_self.\n\nThis formulation ensures that the penalty only applies when the offer is below the fair share. This might better capture the rejection behavior for unfair offers.\n\nTesting this model with an example: token_self=10, fair_share=30. If split_self=20, then U=20 - alpha*(10). If alpha=1, U=10 \u2192 probability ~0.99995 (accept). If alpha=2, U=0 \u2192 probability 0.5. If alpha=3, U=-10 \u2192 probability ~0 (reject). This aligns with the intuition that higher alpha leads to higher likelihood of rejecting offers below the fair share.\n\nAnother example: split_self=30 (fair share), U=30, regardless of alpha. Probability ~1.0. If split_self=40, U=40, which is higher, leading to even higher acceptance probability. This makes sense as the offer is more than fair.\n\nThis model has one learnable parameter, alpha, which should be bounded. Since alpha represents the penalty per unit deficit, it can't be negative (as a negative alpha would imply that participants prefer offers below their fair share). So alpha's range is [0, upper_bound]. To set a generous upper bound, perhaps 5. This allows for cases where a \u00a31 deficit reduces utility by \u00a35, making rejection very likely even for small deficits.\n\nTherefore, the final model is:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nThis model uses split_self and token_self from the dataset. The variable 3*token_self is calculated as the fair share. The parameter alpha is learnable with bounds [0,5].\n\nNow, the variables section needs to describe each variable in the model. The variables involved are:\n\n- split_self: from the data, float64.\n- token_self: from the data, int64.\n- alpha: learnable parameter, range [0,5].\n- U: calculated utility.\n\nThe target variable is \"accept\", which is predicted via the logistic function applied to U.\n\nSo the variables JSON would include:\n\n- split_self: source data, not learnable.\n- token_self: source data, not learnable.\n- alpha: learnable, range [0,5].\n- U: calculated.\n\nThe model formula is enclosed in <MODEL> tags, and variables described in <VARIABLES>.\n</think>\n\nI have recieved the test instructions\n\n<MODEL>\nU = split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed monetary share for the participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant (contribution measure)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fairness sensitivity parameter: penalty per \u00a3 deficit from fair share (3 * token_self)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposal\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>accept</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA fairness-driven utility model where participants evaluate offers relative to their contribution-based fair share (3 * token_self).

    "Specification: tags, and variables described in <VARIABLES>.\n</think>\n\nI have recieved the test instructions\n\n<MODEL>\nU = split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\nSummary: A fairness-driven utility model where participants evaluate offers relative to their contribution-based fair share (3 * token_self). The utility combines the proposed amount (split_self) with a penalty for offers below the fair share, scaled by a learnable sensitivity parameter (alpha). The model predicts acceptance probability via logistic transformation of the utility, capturing both self-interest and contribution-based fairness considerations.\nTarget Variable: accept\nPrediction Type: utility"
