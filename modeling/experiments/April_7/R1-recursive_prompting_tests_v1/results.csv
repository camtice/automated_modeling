U = split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)","A fairness-driven utility model where participants evaluate offers relative to their contribution-based fair share (3 * token_self). The utility combines the proposed amount (split_self) with a penalty for offers below the fair share, scaled by a learnable sensitivity parameter (alpha). The model predicts acceptance probability via logistic transformation of the utility, capturing both self-interest and contribution-based fairness considerations.",v1,"Be VERY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters as the model.
