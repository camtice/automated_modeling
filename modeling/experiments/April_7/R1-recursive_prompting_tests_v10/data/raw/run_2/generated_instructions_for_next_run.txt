For Run 3, we suggest pushing the limits of out‐of‐the‐box thinking while preserving the core formulation that showed promise in previous runs. In addition to the previous model, emphasize rigorous reparameterization to counter potential covariance. Consider ways to further decorrelate beta0, lambda_param, and gamma (for example, by suggesting normalization, alternative parameter transforms, or even a flexible baseline function). The instructions below encourage creative modifications that could refine the fairness expectation computation, such as testing a log‐transformation or adding a scaling factor to the token contribution ratio, while keeping the formulation parsimonious. Remember that the overall structure (baseline bias plus scaled discrepancy between offered split and expected fair share) with a non‐linear exponent gamma remains the core, but the solver is now encouraged to experiment with slight modifications that could reduce parameter correlation and improve recovery and predictive accuracy. Ensure that bounds remain realistic: beta0 ∈ [–10, 10], lambda_param ∈ [–20, 20], gamma ∈ [0.5, 2.0]. Also, the mapping from computed utility to binary choice should be via the standard logistic transformation. Be precise in the model’s math and variable descriptions, and keep the presentation clear and unambiguous.

Updated Instructions for Run 3:

1. Develop a computational model to predict the utility underlying the binary choice (accept/reject) that maintains the original structure but allows room for innovative reparameterization to reduce covariance among parameters. In this model, the baseline bias parameter (beta0), fairness sensitivity parameter (lambda_param), and a non-linear curvature parameter (gamma) shape the decision utility.

2. Compute the fairness expectation as:
   (token_self / (token_self + token_opp))^gamma * combined_earning.
   Then, calculate the decision utility as:
   U = beta0 + lambda_param * (split_self - expected_share),
   where expected_share is defined as above.

3. To further improve parameter recovery and lower the BIC, encourage consideration of any reparameterization strategies (e.g., normalizing token contributions, applying a log transformation to the token ratio, or including a flexible scaling adjustment) that might help reduce covariance among beta0, lambda_param, and gamma without overcomplicating the model.

4. Set generous yet realistic bounds for the learnable parameters:
   - beta0: between –10 and 10,
   - lambda_param: between –20 and 20,
   - gamma: between 0.5 and 2.0.

5. Present your model using clear mathematical notation enclosed between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and list variable descriptions in JSON format enclosed between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags. Make sure each variable is clearly mapped to observable data, and specify the target variable with <target_variable>accept</target_variable>.

6. In the summary (<SUMMARY> tags), concisely describe that the model computes decision utility through a blend of baseline bias, fairness sensitivity, and a non-linear modulation of the fairness expectation. Note that the approach emphasizes reducing parameter covariance and enhancing parameter recovery and predictive accuracy, while allowing creative modifications (like token ratio transformations) to further improve performance metrics.

7. Encourage out-of-the-box experimentation to adjust the non-linear transformation if it can robustly capture diminishing sensitivity in fairness evaluations. Creativity in exploring alternative transformations or scaling methods is welcome as long as the core structure is maintained.

These instructions should guide the design of a model that not only adheres to the functional form but also innovates on its parameter structure to achieve better accuracy, lower BIC, and improved parameter recovery.
