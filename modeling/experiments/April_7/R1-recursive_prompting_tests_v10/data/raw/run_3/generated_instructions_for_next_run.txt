For Run 4, we want the model to further innovate while maintaining the core structure. The instructions should emphasize creative reparameterization ideas such as normalization or log transformation of token ratios, flexible scaling adjustments, and possible alternative formulations for the fairness expectation. The goal is to reduce parameter covariance, improve parameter recovery, and enhance predictive accuracy without straying too far from the established framework. We should also clearly mandate realistic bounds for beta0, lambda_param, and gamma while encouraging out-of-the-box thinking.

Updated Instructions for Run 4:

1. Develop a computational model to predict the utility underlying a binary choice (accept/reject) that uses a core formulation while encouraging innovative reparameterization to reduce covariance among parameters. The model should include a baseline bias term (beta0), a fairness sensitivity parameter (lambda_param), and a non-linear curvature parameter (gamma).

2. Compute the fairness expectation as follows:
   expected_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp))^gamma * combined_earning.
   Then, define the decision utility as:
   U = beta0 + lambda_param * (split_self - expected_share).

3. To improve parameter recovery and lower BIC, you are encouraged to experiment with modifications such as:
   - Normalizing the token_self and token_opp values (or applying a log transformation) before computing their ratio.
   - Introducing a flexible scaling or shifting adjustment to the ratio to capture diminishing sensitivity.
   - Exploring alternative transformations of the token ratio that maintain interpretability and do not overly complicate the model.

4. Ensure the computed utility is mapped to a probability via the standard logistic transformation:
   P = 1 / (1 + exp(-U)).

5. Set generous yet realistic bounds for the learnable parameters:
   - beta0: between –10 and 10,
   - lambda_param: between –20 and 20,
   - gamma: between 0.5 and 2.0.

6. Present your model using clear mathematical notation enclosed between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and provide variable descriptions in JSON format between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags. Clearly map each variable to its corresponding observed data and specify the target variable with <target_variable>accept</target_variable>.

7. In the summary (<SUMMARY> tags), concisely describe that the model computes decision utility via a blend of baseline bias, fairness sensitivity, and a non-linear transformation of the fairness expectation. Highlight that the approach leverages creative reparameterization strategies to reduce parameter covariance and improve recovery and predictive accuracy.

8. Encourage out-of-the-box experimentation to adjust the non-linear transformation and explore alternative token contribution transformations while maintaining the core structure. Creativity in exploring normalization, log transformations, or flexible scaling adjustments is highly welcome.

These instructions should guide the design of a model that adheres to the structure but innovates in its parameter transformations to achieve better accuracy, lower BIC, and improved parameter recovery.
