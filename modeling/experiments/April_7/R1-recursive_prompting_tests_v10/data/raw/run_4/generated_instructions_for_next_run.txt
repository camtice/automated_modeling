For run 5, we need to build on our previous models by encouraging even more creative reparameterization strategies. The goal is to improve overall model performance, parameter recovery, and BIC. We want the model to maintain the core structure while innovating in how the fairness expectation is computed. We should suggest experimenting with alternative transformations (e.g., different normalization techniques, alternative scales or shifting constants) and possibly letting the transformation function be partly learned rather than simply using the fixed ratio raised to gamma. We will also insist on realistic but generous bounds for beta0, lambda_param, and gamma, and encourage thinking outside the most obvious choices.

Updated Instructions for Run 5:

1. Develop a computational model that predicts the utility underlying a binary decision (accept/reject) using an innovative reformulation of a baseline bias, fairness sensitivity, and a non-linear transformation of the fairness expectation. The core model should have a baseline term (beta0), a sensitivity parameter (lambda_param), and a non-linear curvature parameter (gamma).

2. Define the fairness expectation as a transformation of the token ratio:
   • Begin with the ratio of token_self to the sum (token_self + token_opp).
   • Experiment with alternative transformations such as:
     - Normalization (e.g., standardizing the tokens by their sum or mean values),
     - Log transformation (e.g., using log(token_self + c) over a function of token_self and token_opp, where c is a constant),
     - Incorporating a flexible shifting or scaling factor prior to applying the non-linear transformation.
   • Finally, multiply the transformed ratio by the combined_earning to obtain the fairness expectation.

3. Compute decision utility as:
   U = beta0 + lambda_param * (split_self - fairness_expectation).

4. Map the utility to a predicted acceptance probability via the logistic function:
   P = 1 / (1 + exp(-U)).

5. Set generous but realistic bounds for the learnable parameters:
   • beta0: between –10 and 10,
   • lambda_param: between –20 and 20,
   • gamma: between 0.5 and 2.0.
   Feel free to incorporate additional parameters for scaling or shifting if needed, provided all new parameters also have realistic bounds.

6. Present your model using clear mathematical notation between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and provide complete variable descriptions in JSON format between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES>. Specify the target variable using <target_variable>accept</target_variable>.

7. In the summary (<SUMMARY> tags), concisely explain that the model calculates decision utility by combining baseline bias, fairness sensitivity, and a creatively transformed fairness expectation. Emphasize that innovative reparameterization strategies (e.g., alternative normalizations, log transformations, and scaling adjustments) are incorporated to reduce parameter covariance and improve parameter recovery and predictive accuracy.

8. Encourage out-of-the-box experimentation with the token ratio transformation while ensuring the core framework remains interpretable and applicable to the dataset. Innovative ideas that deviate subtly from the standard formulation but maintain clarity are highly welcome.

These instructions should guide the creation of a model that aims to optimize accuracy, lower BIC, and significantly enhance parameter recovery, leveraging creative reparameterization approaches without deviating from the fundamental structure.
