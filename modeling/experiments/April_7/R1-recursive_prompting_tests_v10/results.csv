For run 2, we want to push performance by reducing covariance between parameters and introducing a flexible transformation that may capture non-linearities in the fairness expectation. The idea is to allow the model to account for diminishing sensitivity or curvature in the evaluation of fairness, which could be important given how contributions translate to expectations. Adding an extra learnable parameter (e.g., gamma) to shape the token ratio exponent can still keep the model parsimonious if implemented carefully. At the same time, we must ensure that the new parameter’s bounds are generous yet realistic so that the model can explore different curvatures without becoming unstable in estimation. We also emphasize clear variable mapping so that all components from the task are used. Keep the standard logistic transformation for linking utility to choice.
</think>

Please use the following updated instructions for Run 2:

1. Develop a computational model to predict the utility underlying the binary choice (accept/reject) that incorporates a non-linear transformation of the fairness expectation. In addition to the baseline bias parameter (beta0) and fairness sensitivity parameter (lambda_param), introduce a new learnable parameter (gamma) that modulates the contribution ratio. This will allow the model to capture potential non-linearities (e.g., diminishing sensitivity) when comparing the actual split to the expected fair share.

2. The expected share should be computed as:
   (token_self / (token_self + token_opp))^gamma * combined_earning.
   Then, the decision utility is calculated as:
   U = beta0 + lambda_param * (split_self - expected_share).

3. Be very considerate of potential high covariance among learnable parameters. By introducing gamma in a way that reparameterizes the fairness expectation (instead of forcing a strictly linear effect), you can potentially decrease the correlation between beta0, lambda_param, and gamma. Set generous yet realistic bounds for all learnable parameters:
   - beta0: between –10 and 10,
   - lambda_param: between –20 and 20,
   - gamma: between 0.5 and 2.0.

4. Present your model using clear mathematical notation between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags and list variable descriptions in JSON format between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags. Ensure each variable used is mapped correctly to observable data and that the target variable is specified with <target_variable>accept</target_variable>.

5. In your summary (<SUMMARY> tags), concisely describe the model’s purpose: its use of a baseline bias, fairness sensitivity, and a non-linear modulation (via gamma) of the fairness expectation to adjust for potential diminishing sensitivity effects. Emphasize that the model aims to reduce parameter covariance while improving parameter recovery, overall accuracy, and lowering the BIC.

6. Encourage out-of-the-box thinking. Do not hesitate to include a brief rationale (if needed outside of the formal model code) for why a non-linear transformation might better capture participant processing of fairness, and how this may lead to better performance metrics without overcomplicating the model.

These updated instructions should guide you towards a model design that improves accuracy, BIC, and parameter recovery through thoughtful reparameterization and a slight expansion of learnable parameters.",0.6887143073529858,0.9088068484072157,0.7444337925247946,

For Run 3, we suggest pushing the limits of out‐of‐the‐box thinking while preserving the core formulation that showed promise in previous runs. In addition to the previous model, emphasize rigorous reparameterization to counter potential covariance. Consider ways to further decorrelate beta0, lambda_param, and gamma (for example, by suggesting normalization, alternative parameter transforms, or even a flexible baseline function). The instructions below encourage creative modifications that could refine the fairness expectation computation, such as testing a log‐transformation or adding a scaling factor to the token contribution ratio, while keeping the formulation parsimonious. Remember that the overall structure (baseline bias plus scaled discrepancy between offered split and expected fair share) with a non‐linear exponent gamma remains the core, but the solver is now encouraged to experiment with slight modifications that could reduce parameter correlation and improve recovery and predictive accuracy. Ensure that bounds remain realistic: beta0 ∈ [–10, 10], lambda_param ∈ [–20, 20], gamma ∈ [0.5, 2.0]. Also, the mapping from computed utility to binary choice should be via the standard logistic transformation. Be precise in the model’s math and variable descriptions, and keep the presentation clear and unambiguous.

Updated Instructions for Run 3:

1. Develop a computational model to predict the utility underlying the binary choice (accept/reject) that maintains the original structure but allows room for innovative reparameterization to reduce covariance among parameters. In this model, the baseline bias parameter (beta0), fairness sensitivity parameter (lambda_param), and a non-linear curvature parameter (gamma) shape the decision utility.

2. Compute the fairness expectation as:
   (token_self / (token_self + token_opp))^gamma * combined_earning.
   Then, calculate the decision utility as:
   U = beta0 + lambda_param * (split_self - expected_share),
   where expected_share is defined as above.

3. To further improve parameter recovery and lower the BIC, encourage consideration of any reparameterization strategies (e.g., normalizing token contributions, applying a log transformation to the token ratio, or including a flexible scaling adjustment) that might help reduce covariance among beta0, lambda_param, and gamma without overcomplicating the model.

4. Set generous yet realistic bounds for the learnable parameters:

7. Encourage out-of-the-box experimentation to adjust the non-linear transformation if it can robustly capture diminishing sensitivity in fairness evaluations. Creativity in exploring alternative transformations or scaling methods is welcome as long as the core structure is maintained.

Updated Instructions for Run 4:

1. Develop a computational model to predict the utility underlying a binary choice (accept/reject) that uses a core formulation while encouraging innovative reparameterization to reduce covariance among parameters. The model should include a baseline bias term (beta0), a fairness sensitivity parameter (lambda_param), and a non-linear curvature parameter (gamma).

2. Compute the fairness expectation as follows:
   expected_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp))^gamma * combined_earning.

3. To improve parameter recovery and lower BIC, you are encouraged to experiment with modifications such as:
   - Normalizing the token_self and token_opp values (or applying a log transformation) before computing their ratio.
   - Introducing a flexible scaling or shifting adjustment to the ratio to capture diminishing sensitivity.
   - Exploring alternative transformations of the token ratio that maintain interpretability and do not overly complicate the model.

4. Ensure the computed utility is mapped to a probability via the standard logistic transformation:

For run 5, we need to build on our previous models by encouraging even more creative reparameterization strategies. The goal is to improve overall model performance, parameter recovery, and BIC. We want the model to maintain the core structure while innovating in how the fairness expectation is computed. We should suggest experimenting with alternative transformations (e.g., different normalization techniques, alternative scales or shifting constants) and possibly letting the transformation function be partly learned rather than simply using the fixed ratio raised to gamma. We will also insist on realistic but generous bounds for beta0, lambda_param, and gamma, and encourage thinking outside the most obvious choices.

Updated Instructions for Run 5:

1. Develop a computational model that predicts the utility underlying a binary decision (accept/reject) using an innovative reformulation of a baseline bias, fairness sensitivity, and a non-linear transformation of the fairness expectation. The core model should have a baseline term (beta0), a sensitivity parameter (lambda_param), and a non-linear curvature parameter (gamma).

2. Define the fairness expectation as a transformation of the token ratio:
   • Begin with the ratio of token_self to the sum (token_self + token_opp).
   • Experiment with alternative transformations such as:
     - Normalization (e.g., standardizing the tokens by their sum or mean values),
     - Log transformation (e.g., using log(token_self + c) over a function of token_self and token_opp, where c is a constant),
     - Incorporating a flexible shifting or scaling factor prior to applying the non-linear transformation.
   • Finally, multiply the transformed ratio by the combined_earning to obtain the fairness expectation.

3. Compute decision utility as:
   U = beta0 + lambda_param * (split_self - fairness_expectation).

4. Map the utility to a predicted acceptance probability via the logistic function:
   P = 1 / (1 + exp(-U)).

   Feel free to incorporate additional parameters for scaling or shifting if needed, provided all new parameters also have realistic bounds.
