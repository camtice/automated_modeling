The previous model achieved a decent accuracy (0.729), but the BIC (35.73) is relatively high, and the parameter recovery for beta is quite poor (r = 0.167). This suggests the model might be oversimplified or that the parameterization is not ideal, leading to identifiability issues and poor parameter recovery. The correlation between parameters is also likely high given the low parameter recovery.

Here's how to improve the instructions:

1.  **Emphasize more complex, interaction-based models:** Encourage the model to explore non-linear relationships between variables and consider interaction effects. The previous model was a simple linear combination, which may not fully capture the underlying psychological processes. It may be useful to suggest the idea of diminishing returns to absolute reward and also diminishing marginal impact of fairness after some threshold.
2.  **Encourage a wider search for relevant variables:** The current model only uses 'split_self', 'token_self', and 'token_opp'. It might be beneficial to encourage exploration of other variables like 'combined_earning' or 'trial_type' to see if they improve model fit and parameter recovery.
3.  **Address the parameter recovery issue directly:** Explain what poor parameter recovery means (model isn't identifiable) and suggest strategies to improve it.
4. **Provide a more concrete example of reasoning:** Showing a good and bad example would allow the model to generate better responses.
5. **Suggest thinking of other utility terms**: Mentioning social comparison, loss aversion, or fairness models might kickstart creativity.

Be VERY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters in the model. Aim for an appropriate number of learnable parameters, with a slight bias for fewer parameters to avoid overfitting. Poor parameter recovery indicates that the model is not identifiable. You should aim for parameter recovery r values above 0.7 if possible. If parameter recovery is not possible, consider removing the parameter from your model to improve BIC, and focus on other terms.

First, reason step by step about:
* The key psychological mechanisms involved, including potential non-linear relationships or interaction effects (e.g., diminishing returns).
* How these mechanisms interact, especially regarding fairness, loss aversion, and social comparison.
* What mathematical form could capture these interactions. Consider functions beyond simple linear combinations; explore multiplicative or exponential terms.
* What parameters would be needed to calibrate the model, focusing on parameters that are identifiable and have a clear psychological interpretation.
* How the model variables map to observable behavior. Consider how different variables might have interacting effects on the ultimate decision to accept or reject.

Consider incorporating insights from established utility theories, such as prospect theory, inequity aversion, or other social preference models. Can other variables, such as 'combined_earning' or 'trial_type', explain significant variance in responder behavior? Consider models beyond simple linear combinations. Perhaps the utility from 'split_self' exhibits diminishing returns, or the impact of fairness considerations is non-linear. Explore interaction effects between variables; for example, does the influence of 'token_self' on utility depend on the 'combined_earning'? Consider including other utility terms such as social comparison, loss aversion, or fairness models. The most obvious models are not often the best.

Example of a good vs bad reasoning process:

BAD:
"The key psychological mechanism is fairness. People want an even split."
This is far too simplistic.

GOOD:
"The key psychological mechanisms in the Ultimatum Game involve both self-interest and fairness considerations. Responders evaluate offers based on the absolute amount offered ('split_self') and relative to their contribution ('token_self' vs 'token_opp'). However, the impact of fairness might diminish as the offer increases; a small unfairness might be tolerated for a large reward. Also, responders may be sensitive to the overall pot size ('combined_earning'); an unfair split from a large pot might be more acceptable than the same unfair split from a small pot. Loss aversion may also play a role, where responders are more sensitive to the potential loss of rejecting an offer than the gain of accepting it. Social comparison might also play a role, where the participant compares their split to the opponents split."
This is a much more nuanced and complete perspective to build a model from.
