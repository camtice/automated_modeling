It considers the fairness of the split relative to earnings, the absolute amount offered, the proposers generosity, and noise. The utility function combines these factors, weighted by learnable parameters for fairness sensitivity (alpha), amount sensitivity (beta), a fairness reference point parameter (rho), and intent weight (gamma). A noise parameter (delta) also exists for gaussian noise. The model predicts the probability of acceptance using a logistic function with a temperature of 1.",v4,"Be VERY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters as the model.
