Be VERY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters as the model. Have an appropriate number or learnable parameters, with a slight bias for less learnable paramters.

First, reason step by step about:
* The key psychological mechanisms involved
* How these mechanisms interact
* What mathematical form could capture these interactions
* What parameters would be needed to calibrate the model
* How the model variables map to observable behavior
