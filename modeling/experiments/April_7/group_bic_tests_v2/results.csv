The utility is determined by three parameters: `alpha` which represents sensitivity to advantageous inequity, `beta` which represents the sensitivity to disadvantageous inequity and `gamma` which represents sensitivity to absolute reward. All learnable parameters are bounded from 0 to 10. These parameters capture fairness considerations as a function of the ratio between the proposed split for the responder and the proportion of the total contribution that the responder had.",v2,"Be VERY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters as the model. Have an appropriate number or learnable parameters, with a slight bias for less learnable paramters.

First, reason step by step about:
* The key psychological mechanisms involved
* How these mechanisms interact
* What mathematical form could capture these interactions
* What parameters would be needed to calibrate the model
* How the model variables map to observable behavior",0.30315773333888923,0.27902617014792225,0.8450614128168509
