The utility considers the proposed split for the participant (split_self), inequity aversion (alpha, beta), the relative contribution of tokens (kappa), and random noise (mu). A logistic function transforms the utility into a probability of accepting the offer. There are 5 learnable parameters: delta (sensitivity to overall earnings), alpha (disadvantageous inequity aversion), beta (advantageous inequity aversion), kappa (token contribution weighting), and mu (noise).",v3,"Be VERY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters as the model. Have an appropriate number or learnable parameters, with a slight bias for less learnable paramters.

First, reason step by step about:
* The key psychological mechanisms involved
* How these mechanisms interact
* What mathematical form could capture these interactions
* What parameters would be needed to calibrate the model
* How the model variables map to observable behavior",0.2012880790803648,0.25688569260233746,0.05333828613615685,-0.12068471107040124,0.1588674611517136
