Four parameters are learned: sensitivity to the amount offered (beta_amount), coefficients for disadvantageous (alpha_disadvantage) and advantageous (alpha_advantage) inequity aversion, and a sensitivity to the total amount earned (earning_sensitivity).",v4,"Be VERY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters as the model. Have an appropriate number or learnable parameters, with a slight bias for less learnable paramters.

First, reason step by step about:
* The key psychological mechanisms involved
* How these mechanisms interact
* What mathematical form could capture these interactions
* What parameters would be needed to calibrate the model
* How the model variables map to observable behavior",-0.05463338492449212,0.39878354312639186,0.04724071505928252,0.17725144339843285
