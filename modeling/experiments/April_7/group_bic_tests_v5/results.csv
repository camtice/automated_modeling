The utility is determined by the proposed split for the participant, adjusted for inequity aversion (sensitivity to the difference between the proposed split and a calculated fair split) and the relative contribution of each player. The model utilizes two learnable parameters: `alpha` (sensitivity to inequity) and `beta` (loss aversion weight).",v5,"Be VERY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters as the model. Have an appropriate number or learnable parameters, with a slight bias for less learnable paramters.

First, reason step by step about:
* The key psychological mechanisms involved
* How these mechanisms interact
* What mathematical form could capture these interactions
* What parameters would be needed to calibrate the model
* How the model variables map to observable behavior",0.3131930716978518,0.6850695278293412
