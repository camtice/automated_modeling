U_accept = rho * split_self - phi_type * penalty_amount","A utility model for predicting responder acceptance decisions. The utility of accepting an offer is determined by the proposed amount for the participant and a penalty for offers falling below an equal (50/50) split of the total pot. The sensitivity to this unfairness penalty is parameterized independently based on the trial's contribution type (equal, opponent more, participant more), allowing for context-dependent fairness preferences. The model has four learnable parameters: one for the sensitivity to own gain and three for the type-specific sensitivities to unfairness. Utility is mapped to the probability of acceptance via a logistic function.",v0,"Be VERY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters as the model. Have an appropriate number or learnable parameters, with a slight bias for less learnable paramters.

First, reason step by step about:
* The key psychological mechanisms involved
* How these mechanisms interact
* What mathematical form could capture these interactions
* What parameters would be needed to calibrate the model
* How the model variables map to observable behavior",0.7670488132587737,0.6572599818022107,0.37900948450239236,0.47888082954448485
