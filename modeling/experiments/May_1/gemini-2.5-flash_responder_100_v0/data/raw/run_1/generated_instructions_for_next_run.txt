<think>The user wants updated instructions for the computational modeling LLM.
The goal is to improve BIC, accuracy, and parameter recovery (specifically aiming for > 0.7).
The LLM is stateless and cannot access previous interactions.
I need to provide instructions that guide the LLM based on the observation that the previous model had poor parameter recovery for most parameters, likely due to identifiability issues or parameter covariance.
The instructions should encourage exploring alternative, potentially simpler, or differently structured models to improve recovery while maintaining performance.
I must *only* output the new instructions text, enclosed in `<new_instructions>` tags, and do any thinking within `<think>` tags.

Previous Run Analysis:
- Model complexity: 4 learnable parameters.
- Outcome: Good accuracy, acceptable BIC, very poor parameter recovery for beta_zero, beta_two, and beta_three.
- Problem: Likely parameter identifiability or high covariance. The model might be trying to capture too many nuanced effects with correlated parameters, given the data.

Instruction Goals:
1. Explicitly state the importance of parameter recovery (> 0.7 threshold).
2. Emphasize parameter identifiability and avoiding high covariance as a primary design goal.
3. Suggest strategies:
    - Consider simpler models (fewer parameters).
    - Explore different functional forms beyond simple linear combinations or max functions.
    - Maybe focus on fewer psychological mechanisms if modeling all simultaneously hinders recovery.
4. Reiterate the task requirements (responder only, dataset variables, utility model).
5. Update the initial step-by-step reasoning prompt to incorporate identifiability and recovery considerations.
6. Keep the output format requirements clear (<MODEL>, <VARIABLES>, etc.).
7. Avoid mentioning specific run numbers or outcomes directly, frame it as general challenges for modeling this task.

Drafting new instructions:
- Start by setting the priorities: BIC, Accuracy, and *crucially* Parameter Recovery (all learnable parameters must have recovery > 0.7). Emphasize that poor recovery makes a model unusable.
- State that achieving good parameter recovery has been a key challenge for models on this task.
- Instruct the LLM to prioritize designing a model where parameters are highly identifiable from the data. Mention that high covariance between parameters is a common pitfall leading to poor recovery.
- Suggest that this might require simplifying the model (fewer learnable parameters) or rethinking how different psychological influences (like self-interest, 50% fairness, proportional fairness) are mathematically combined or weighted.
- Encourage exploration of alternative model structures or functional forms that might simplify the parameter space or reduce dependencies between parameters. Think about threshold models, different penalty structures, or models focusing on fewer distinct fairness reference points if needed for identifiability.
- Reiterate the task context: predicting responder acceptance based on offer percentage, potentially influenced by fairness considerations (50% split, proportional split based on tokens). List key available variables again.
- Reiterate the output format requirements.
- Modify the step-by-step reasoning prompt to explicitly include considerations for identifiability, covariance, and model simplicity/complexity trade-offs.

Refining wording:
- "Design your computational model with parameter identifiability as a *primary* design goal. Models for this task have previously struggled with recovering parameters reliably (aiming for > 0.7 correlation), often due to high covariance or over-parameterization."
- "Carefully consider how different psychological factors (like self-interest and aversion to different types of unfairness) are combined mathematically. Highly correlated parameters can make the model unusable, even if it fits the data well."
- "Explore models with fewer learnable parameters if necessary. A simpler model with identifiable parameters is preferred over a complex one with unidentifiable parameters."
- "Do not be constrained by standard linear utility model structures. Think creatively about alternative mathematical forms (e.g., threshold models, non-linear penalties) or ways to combine influences that reduce parameter interdependencies and improve identifiability."
- Update reasoning points: "How does the model structure ensure that each learnable parameter can be uniquely estimated from the data? What are potential sources of covariance between parameters, and how can the structure minimize this? Is the number of learnable parameters appropriate for the complexity of the psychological process and the data available?"

Okay, planning complete. I will generate the instructions based on these points.<new_instructions>Design a computational model for the described ultimatum game responder task. Your model must meet the following criteria:
1.  **Predict only responder behavior** (target variable: "accept").
2.  **Pass parameter recovery tests.** This is a *primary* objective. All learnable parameters must ideally achieve a recovery correlation of **at least 0.7**. A model where parameters cannot be reliably recovered is unusable. Prioritize model structures that enhance parameter identifiability from the data.
3.  **Be applicable to the dataset:** Use only the provided data structure and variables.
4.  **Predict utility:** Utility values will be converted to acceptance probabilities using a logistic function (with temperature 1). A utility > 0 implies > 50% probability of acceptance.

Design your model with parameter identifiability and low parameter covariance as *critical* considerations. Computational models for this task have previously faced significant challenges in reliably recovering learnable parameters, even when fitting the data well. This often stems from parameters being too highly correlated or the model being over-parameterized relative to the available data.

Carefully consider the number of learnable parameters. While complex psychological processes are at play, a simpler model with well-identifiable parameters is substantially more valuable than a complex one with parameters that cannot be reliably estimated. Bias towards fewer learnable parameters if it improves identifiability and recovery.

Do not feel restricted to standard linear utility model structures. Explore alternative functional forms, different ways to combine influences (e.g., non-linear relationships, threshold effects, multiplicative interactions), or potentially focus on a subset of psychological mechanisms if attempting to model all simultaneously leads to parameter identifiability issues. Think creatively about how self-interest, aversion to a 50% split, and aversion to a proportional split might interact or be weighted in a way that allows their unique contributions to be estimated.

For any learnable parameters, you must specify generous, finite numerical bounds. The utility variable may be unbounded.

Provide your formal mathematical model between <MODEL> tags. Ensure *only* the mathematical formula is within these tags.
Provide variable descriptions in JSON format between <VARIABLES> tags. Ensure learnable parameter names are clear and suitable for coding. Spell out Greek variables.
Specify the target variable using <target_variable> tags.
Provide a concise, descriptive summary of the model between <SUMMARY> tags.

Available Data Variables:
- trial_type, trial_role, token_opp, token_self, combined_earning, split_opp, split_self, splitperc_opp, split_perc_self, accept, accepted_amount, accepted_perc, proposed_perc, proposed_amount.
Remember to only model responder trials (where trial_role == 1).

First, reason step by step about:
*   The key psychological mechanisms involved in responder decisions (self-interest, fairness/inequality aversion relative to different reference points like 50% or proportional share).
*   How these mechanisms might interact mathematically.
*   What mathematical form could capture these interactions while ensuring parameter identifiability and minimizing covariance.
*   What is the minimum necessary set of parameters needed to capture the essential aspects of the behavior *robustly*, allowing for reliable parameter recovery?
*   How the model variables map to observable behavior ("accept").
*   How the chosen model structure and parameters will impact parameter recovery.

Please think through this step by step, then provide your model specification, variable descriptions, target variable, and summary.
