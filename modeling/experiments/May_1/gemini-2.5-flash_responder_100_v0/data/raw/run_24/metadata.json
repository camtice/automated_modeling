Please choose clear, non-reserved parameter names that can be used directly in Python code. For example, avoid Python reserved words like 'lambda' and use alternatives like 'learning_rate' or 'lambda_param'.\n\nModel Type:\nYour model should predict the utility of a binary choice. The utility will be converted to a probability using a logistic function with temperature 1, and then used to predict binary decisions.\n\nInstructions:\nIn the previous run (Run 23), the model `U = sensitivity_offer * split_perc_self - penalty_unfair_deviation * unfair_deviation + acceptance_bias` achieved excellent accuracy (0.847) and acceptable BIC (110.90). However, parameter recovery was poor for two out of three parameters (`penalty_unfair_deviation`: r = 0.649, `acceptance_bias`: r = 0.055), falling below the critical 0.7 threshold. This makes the model unusable for drawing meaningful conclusions about the fitted parameter values. The `acceptance_bias` term has shown consistently poor recovery across multiple previous model attempts.\n\nFor this run (Run 24), the absolute highest priority is to achieve parameter recovery >= 0.7 for *all* learnable parameters. While maintaining good BIC and accuracy is still important, interpretability through parameter recovery is essential. Based on the difficulties in recovering the `acceptance_bias` and the only marginal recovery of `penalty_unfair_deviation` in the last run, let's simplify the model structure to improve identifiability. The `generous_deviation` term has also proven problematic for recovery in past models and should continue to be excluded.\n\nConsider a new, simpler model structure with two learnable parameters:\n`U = sensitivity_offer * split_perc_self - penalty_unfair_deviation * unfair_deviation`\n\nThis model retains the influence of the raw offered percentage (`split_perc_self`) and a penalty for unfair offers (`unfair_deviation`) but removes the `acceptance_bias` term. `unfair_deviation` is calculated as `max(0, fair_perc_self - split_perc_self)`, where `fair_perc_self` is the fair share based on token contributions.\n\nThis structure has two learnable parameters:\n1.  `sensitivity_offer`: Represents the rate at which utility increases with the offered percentage (`split_perc_self`). This parameter should be non-negative.\n2.  `penalty_unfair_deviation`: Represents the rate at which utility decreases for each percentage point the offer is below the fair share (`fair_perc_self`). This parameter should be non-negative.\n\n**Guidance for the Next Model (Run 24):**\n\nDesign a computational model implementing this specific two-parameter structure: `U = sensitivity_offer * split_perc_self - penalty_unfair_deviation * unfair_deviation`. The primary goal is to achieve parameter recovery >= 0.7 for *all* learnable parameters (`sensitivity_offer`, `penalty_unfair_deviation`) while striving for good BIC and accuracy.\n\n*   **Prioritize Parameter Recovery:** Implement the specified structure precisely. The focus is on determining if this simplified two-parameter combination improves the identifiability of the remaining parameters.\n*   **Parameter Constraints:**\n    *   `sensitivity_offer`: Define clear, generous, finite, non-negative bounds. Suggest [0, 10].\n    *   `penalty_unfair_deviation`: Define clear, generous, finite, non-negative bounds. Suggest [0, 20].\n*   **Model Specification:** Provide the mathematical formula between <MODEL> tags using the suggested structure. Ensure the formula includes the necessary variables and parameters.\n*   **Calculated Variables:** Remember `fair_perc_self` needs to be calculated as `(token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100`. Handle the case where `token_self + token_opp` is zero (e.g., by setting `fair_perc_self` to 50 in this case). Define `unfair_deviation = max(0, fair_perc_self - split_perc_self)` as a calculated variable. Include `U`, `fair_perc_self`, `unfair_deviation`, `token_self`, `token_opp`, and `split_perc_self` in your variable descriptions with `source: \"calculated\"` or `source: \"data\"` as appropriate.\n*   **Variable Descriptions:** Provide variable descriptions in JSON format between <VARIABLES> tags for all variables used in the <MODEL> formula (`U`, `split_perc_self`, `fair_perc_self`, `token_self`, `token_opp`, `unfair_deviation`, `sensitivity_offer`, `penalty_unfair_deviation`), including the specified bounds and learnable status for the parameters. Clearly describe the role of each variable.\n*   **Target Variable:** Specify \"accept\" as the target variable using <target_variable> tags.\n*   **Summary:** Provide a concise summary between <SUMMARY> tags, describing the model structure and its components.\n\nRemember to use variables relevant for responder trials (`trial_role == 1`).\n\nThis model represents a test of whether removing the poorly recovered `acceptance_bias` term and focusing on the core influences of offer value and unfairness penalty can yield identifiable parameters. If this two-parameter model *still* struggles with parameter recovery (i.e., if either `sensitivity_offer` or `penalty_unfair_deviation` falls below 0.7), it would strongly suggest that the relationship between these variables and utility is not well captured by this simple linear form. In that case, more \"out of the box\" thinking, such as exploring non-linear functions (e.g., quadratic penalties, exponential sensitivity), interaction terms, or incorporating different variables, would be necessary in future attempts to find a structurally identifiable model.\n\nFor run 24 of 100, please think through this step by step, focusing intently on implementing the specified two-parameter model structure and ensuring all output requirements are met. Then provide your model specification, variable descriptions, target variable, and summary.\n\nAvailable Data Variables:\n- trial_type, trial_role, token_opp, token_self, combined_earning, split_opp, split_self, splitperc_opp, split_perc_self, accept, accepted_amount, accepted_perc, proposed_perc, proposed_amount.",

No description of the model should be provided within the <MODEL> tags.\n\nThe parameter names you choose in your <VARIABLES> section will be used exactly as specified in subsequent code generation. Please choose clear, non-reserved parameter names that can be used directly in Python code. For example, avoid Python reserved words like 'lambda' and use alternatives like 'learning_rate' or 'lambda_param'.\n\nModel Type: \nYour model should predict the utility of a binary choice. The utility will be converted to a probability using a logistic function with temperature 1, and then used to predict binary decisions.\n\n\nInstructions: Task Description: In this ultimatum game experiment, the participant acts as both a proposer and a responsder. They are the proposer 14 times and the responsder 36 times. Each is designated by a trial number in the data set. This gives 50 instances for the learnable parameters to be trained (although really it may rather be 36 or 14 depending on how the computational model should be created). There is also a pretask where the participant finds a number of tokens that correspond to their contribution to the group. This is designated by the variable \"token_self\". The other variable, \"token_opp\", is the number of tokens found the opponent's and represents the opoonents contribution to the shared pot that will be later divided by the opponent. The rounds are a mixed, with the participant doing a handful of turns as a responder, then a handful as a proposer, and then a handful as a responder, and so on.\n\nAgain, the participant gets to act as both a proposer and responder - this is reflected in the data. If you are guessing the proposed amount, you should only be making this guess when trial_role == 2, since this is when the data within the proposed_perc and proposed_amount columns are relevent.\n\nNote that in each trial there is a variable amount of money in the combined earning, so that two equal split_self variables do not represent the same \"fairness\".\n\nBelow is the description of each variable in the dataset, which will be followed by information about the data type of the variable:\n\ntrial_type = how much was the contribution [1 = equal, 2 = opponent more, 3 = participant more]\ntrial_role = the role of the participant [1 = responder, 2 = proposer]\ntoken_opp = number of tokens found by the opponent\ntoken_self = number of tokens found by the participant\ncombined_earning = amount of money earned in total (note that each token found is \u00a33)\nsplit_opp = the proposed share of the opponent (in \u00a3)\nsplit_self = the proposed share for the participant (in \u00a3)\nsplitperc_opp = same but in %\nsplit_perc_self = same but in %\naccept = whether the participant responded accept (1) or reject (0))\naccepted_amount = if accepted, what is the amount gain (in \u00a3)\naccepted_perc = same as above but in %\nproposed_perc = when participant is the proposer, what is the % proposed to the opponent\nproposed_amount = when participant is the proposer, what is the amount proposed to the opponent\n\nDesired Output Specification: Design a computational model for the described task. Your model should utilyze the given variables appropriately (but not necessarily all unless otherwise specified).\n\nThe model should:\n1. Predict only responder behavior (should target \"accept = whether the participant responded accept (1) or reject (0)\")\n2. You will have to pass parameter recovery tests. This should be roughly equal in priority to accuracy.\n3. Be applicable to the dataset given within the task description (i.e. the model should be able to be run using only the provided dataset structure).\n4. Predict utility, where less than 0 is less than 50% likely.\n\nFor any learnable parameters in your model, you must specify finite numerical bounds (it just can not be infinity) in the variable descriptions. However, this bound should be generous. The utility variable may be unbounded (-inf to inf).\n\nThen, provide your formal mathematical model between <MODEL> tags, followed by variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> tags. Additionally, specify the target variable that your model will predict. This should be one of the variables from the dataset above. Enclose it in <target_variable> tags.\nFor example: <target_variable>accept</target_variable> if your model is predicting whether a participant accepts or rejects a proposal.\n\nUse clear mathematical notation and ensure each variable is fully described. Every variable must be utilized within the mathematical formula provided between <MODEL> and </MODEL>, and only strictly the mathematical formula should be provided between these tags with no filler words or descriptions. For variable descriptions, provide them in a JSON format with the following structure: <VARIABLES> Bounds are by default inclusive. Please spell out the greek variable names instead of using the symbols. Finally, you should provide a short description of the model in the summary tags <SUMMARY> </SUMMARY>. This will be used to compare different computational models of the task; it should be concise and purely descriptive. Do not include generic information about the name of the tasks, since that is implied.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"variable_name\": {\n      \"description\": \"Clear description\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": value,\n        \"max\": value,\n        \"inclusive_min\": boolean,\n        \"inclusive_max\": boolean\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"distribution type\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": boolean,\n      \"source\": \"learnable/data/calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n</VARIABLES>\n\nExample #1:\n<EXAMPLE>\n(Model of a Random Choice Task):\nLet me think through this step by step...\n[your reasoning here]\n\n<MODEL>\nU_i = beta_param + epsilon_param * E + eta_param * N\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_i\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of choosing action i\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta_param\": {\n      \"description\": \"Base tendency parameter (inherent preference)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"epsilon_param\": {\n      \"description\": \"Environmental sensitivity parameter\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"E\": {\n      \"description\": \"Environmental cue value\",\n      \"range\": {\"min\": \"-inf\", \"max\": \"inf\"},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"eta_param\": {\n      \"description\": \"Noise parameter\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"exclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"N\": {\n      \"description\": \"Random noise drawn from normal distribution N(0,1)\",\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"normal\",\n        \"mean\": 0,\n        \"std\": 1\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n<SUMMARY>\nA linear utility model combining base preference, environmental influence, and stochastic noise.

Please choose clear, non-reserved parameter names that can be used directly in Python code. For example, avoid Python reserved words like 'lambda' and use alternatives like 'learning_rate' or 'lambda_param'.\n\nModel Type:\nYour model should predict the utility of a binary choice. The utility will be converted to a probability using a logistic function with temperature 1, and then used to predict binary decisions.\n\nInstructions:\nIn the previous run (Run 23), the model `U = sensitivity_offer * split_perc_self - penalty_unfair_deviation * unfair_deviation + acceptance_bias` achieved excellent accuracy (0.847) and acceptable BIC (110.90). However, parameter recovery was poor for two out of three parameters (`penalty_unfair_deviation`: r = 0.649, `acceptance_bias`: r = 0.055), falling below the critical 0.7 threshold. This makes the model unusable for drawing meaningful conclusions about the fitted parameter values. The `acceptance_bias` term has shown consistently poor recovery across multiple previous model attempts.\n\nFor this run (Run 24), the absolute highest priority is to achieve parameter recovery >= 0.7 for *all* learnable parameters. While maintaining good BIC and accuracy is still important, interpretability through parameter recovery is essential. Based on the difficulties in recovering the `acceptance_bias` and the only marginal recovery of `penalty_unfair_deviation` in the last run, let's simplify the model structure to improve identifiability. The `generous_deviation` term has also proven problematic for recovery in past models and should continue to be excluded.\n\nConsider a new, simpler model structure with two learnable parameters:\n`U = sensitivity_offer * split_perc_self - penalty_unfair_deviation * unfair_deviation`\n\nThis model retains the influence of the raw offered percentage (`split_perc_self`) and a penalty for unfair offers (`unfair_deviation`) but removes the `acceptance_bias` term. `unfair_deviation` is calculated as `max(0, fair_perc_self - split_perc_self)`, where `fair_perc_self` is the fair share based on token contributions.\n\nThis structure has two learnable parameters:\n1.  `sensitivity_offer`: Represents the rate at which utility increases with the offered percentage (`split_perc_self`). This parameter should be non-negative.\n2.  `penalty_unfair_deviation`: Represents the rate at which utility decreases for each percentage point the offer is below the fair share (`fair_perc_self`). This parameter should be non-negative.\n\n**Guidance for the Next Model (Run 24):**\n\nDesign a computational model implementing this specific two-parameter structure: `U = sensitivity_offer * split_perc_self - penalty_unfair_deviation * unfair_deviation`. The primary goal is to achieve parameter recovery >= 0.7 for *all* learnable parameters (`sensitivity_offer`, `penalty_unfair_deviation`) while striving for good BIC and accuracy.\n\n*   **Prioritize Parameter Recovery:** Implement the specified structure precisely. The focus is on determining if this simplified two-parameter combination improves the identifiability of the remaining parameters.\n*   **Parameter Constraints:**\n    *   `sensitivity_offer`: Define clear, generous, finite, non-negative bounds. Suggest [0, 10].\n    *   `penalty_unfair_deviation`: Define clear, generous, finite, non-negative bounds. Suggest [0, 20].\n*   **Model Specification:** Provide the mathematical formula between <MODEL> tags using the suggested structure. Ensure the formula includes the necessary variables and parameters.\n*   **Calculated Variables:** Remember `fair_perc_self` needs to be calculated as `(token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100`. Handle the case where `token_self + token_opp` is zero (e.g., by setting `fair_perc_self` to 50 in this case). Define `unfair_deviation = max(0, fair_perc_self - split_perc_self)` as a calculated variable. Include `U`, `fair_perc_self`, `unfair_deviation`, `token_self`, `token_opp`, and `split_perc_self` in your variable descriptions with `source: \"calculated\"` or `source: \"data\"` as appropriate.\n*   **Variable Descriptions:** Provide variable descriptions in JSON format between <VARIABLES> tags for all variables used in the <MODEL> formula (`U`, `split_perc_self`, `fair_perc_self`, `token_self`, `token_opp`, `unfair_deviation`, `sensitivity_offer`, `penalty_unfair_deviation`), including the specified bounds and learnable status for the parameters. Clearly describe the role of each variable.\n*   **Target Variable:** Specify \"accept\" as the target variable using <target_variable> tags.\n*   **Summary:** Provide a concise summary between <SUMMARY> tags, describing the model structure and its components.\n\nRemember to use variables relevant for responder trials (`trial_role == 1`).\n\nThis model represents a test of whether removing the poorly recovered `acceptance_bias` term and focusing on the core influences of offer value and unfairness penalty can yield identifiable parameters. If this two-parameter model *still* struggles with parameter recovery (i.e., if either `sensitivity_offer` or `penalty_unfair_deviation` falls below 0.7), it would strongly suggest that the relationship between these variables and utility is not well captured by this simple linear form. In that case, more \"out of the box\" thinking, such as exploring non-linear functions (e.g., quadratic penalties, exponential sensitivity), interaction terms, or incorporating different variables, would be necessary in future attempts to find a structurally identifiable model.\n\nFor run 24 of 100, please think through this step by step, focusing intently on implementing the specified two-parameter model structure and ensuring all output requirements are met. Then provide your model specification, variable descriptions, target variable, and summary.\n\nAvailable Data Variables:\n- trial_type, trial_role, token_opp, token_self, combined_earning, split_opp, split_self, splitperc_opp, split_perc_self, accept, accepted_amount, accepted_perc, proposed_perc, proposed_amount.\n\nPrevious Models:Not Provided\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions.",

The utility of accepting is determined by a linear combination of the proposed percentage for the participant (split_perc_self) and a penalty term (unfair_deviation) representing the amount the offer falls below the calculated fair share based on token contributions. The model has two learnable parameters: sensitivity_offer, weighting the value of the proposed percentage, and penalty_unfair_deviation, weighting the cost of an unfair offer. Both learnable parameters are constrained to be non-negative. The utility is converted to a probability of acceptance using a logistic function.\n</SUMMARY>"

The utility of accepting is determined by a linear combination of the proposed percentage for the participant (split_perc_self) and a penalty term (unfair_deviation) representing the amount the offer falls below the calculated fair share based on token contributions. The model has two learnable parameters: sensitivity_offer, weighting the value of the proposed percentage, and penalty_unfair_deviation, weighting the cost of an unfair offer. Both learnable parameters are constrained to be non-negative. The utility is converted to a probability of acceptance using a logistic function.\nTarget Variable: accept\nPrediction Type: utility\nBIC: 133.0594647989836\nOverall Accuracy: 0.8251\nGroup Accuracies:\n- Control: 0.8630\n- Cocaine: 0.7911\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- sensitivity_offer: r = 0.574\n- penalty_unfair_deviation: r = 0.638"
