<new_instructions>Design a computational model for the described ultimatum game responder task. Your model must meet the following criteria:
1.  **Predict only responder behavior** (target variable: "accept").
2.  **Pass parameter recovery tests.** This is the *most critical* objective. ALL learnable parameters must achieve a recovery correlation of **at least 0.7**. A model where parameters cannot be reliably recovered is unusable. Prioritize model structures that inherently enhance parameter identifiability from the data.
3.  **Be applicable to the dataset:** Use only the provided data structure and variables.
4.  **Predict utility:** Utility values will be converted to acceptance probabilities using a logistic function (with temperature 1). A utility > 0 implies > 50% probability of acceptance.

Achieving reliable parameter recovery for all learnable parameters (>= 0.7 correlation) is the primary challenge for models on this task based on previous attempts. Simply reducing the number of parameters has not consistently solved this issue. The focus needs to be on designing a model structure where the influence of each learnable parameter on the predicted utility is sufficiently distinct and minimally correlated with other parameters given the data structure.

Break away from standard linear or simple penalty-based utility structures if necessary. Explore alternative functional forms and novel ways to combine psychological influences (self-interest, aversion to 50% split unfairness, aversion to proportional split unfairness). Consider approaches inspired by reference-dependent utility theory (e.g., utility based on deviations from reference points rather than absolute values) or models that explicitly parameterize the sensitivities to different factors. Think creatively about how these components interact.

Given the variable 'combined_earning' across trials, carefully consider whether your model's core variables should operate on absolute amounts (Â£, using 'split_self') or percentages (%, using 'split_perc_self'). Using percentages might help normalize for the varying total pot size and improve parameter interpretability and identifiability.

For any learnable parameters, you must specify generous, finite numerical bounds. The utility variable may be unbounded.

Provide your formal mathematical model between <MODEL> tags. Ensure *only* the mathematical formula is within these tags.
Provide variable descriptions in JSON format between <VARIABLES> tags. Ensure learnable parameter names are clear and suitable for coding. Spell out Greek variables.
Specify the target variable using <target_variable> tags.
Provide a concise, descriptive summary of the model between <SUMMARY> tags.

Available Data Variables:
- trial_type, trial_role, token_opp, token_self, combined_earning, split_opp, split_self, splitperc_opp, split_perc_self, accept, accepted_amount, accepted_perc, proposed_perc, proposed_amount.
Remember to only model responder trials (where trial_role == 1).

First, reason step by step about:
*   The key psychological mechanisms involved in responder decisions (self-interest, fairness/inequality aversion relative to different reference points like 50% or proportional share).
*   Given the variable 'combined_earning', should the model work with absolute values (split_self) or percentages (split_perc_self) to best capture behavior and ensure parameter identifiability?
*   What alternative mathematical forms (e.g., reference-dependent utility, non-linear effects, direct parameterization of sensitivities to different factors) could capture these mechanisms in a way that allows for better parameter recovery than standard approaches?
*   How can the learnable parameters be defined and combined in the model structure to minimize covariance and maximize their unique, identifiable influence on the predicted utility?
*   What is the *minimum necessary* set of learnable parameters that can robustly capture the essential aspects of the behavior while prioritizing parameter identifiability?
*   How the model variables map to observable behavior ("accept").

Please think through this step by step, then provide your model specification, variable descriptions, target variable, and summary.
