Okay, here are the improved instructions for the next run, focusing intensely on designing a model structure that ensures parameter identifiability for *both* learnable parameters while building on the successes and addressing the failures of the previous attempts.

Instructions for Run 62 of 100:

The **unwavering primary objective remains achieving parameter recovery >= 0.7 for *all* learnable parameters**. This is the critical benchmark for model usability. While improved BIC (lower is better) and accuracy (higher is better) are valuable secondary goals, they must not come at the expense of robust parameter recovery. A model with excellent fit but poor parameter identifiability is not suitable for drawing meaningful conclusions about the underlying cognitive processes.

The previous run (Run 61) implemented a model (`U = beta_value * split_perc_self - beta_unfairness * max(0, fair_perc_self_calc - split_perc_self)^3`) based on the suggestion to use a linear value term and a **strongly non-linear (cubic), asymmetric unfairness penalty**. This model achieved a significantly lower BIC (44.74) than many previous attempts, indicating good fit to the data, and yielded excellent parameter recovery for `beta_value` (r = 0.917). However, it critically failed to achieve sufficient parameter recovery for `beta_unfairness` (r = -0.172). The negative recovery correlation is a strong indicator that this specific non-linear structure, while fitting the data well and isolating the value parameter, does *not* result in a recoverable estimate for the fairness parameter.

This demonstrates that simply adding a non-linear penalty term, even one as strong as cubic, is not sufficient to guarantee identifiability for the second parameter when combined additively/subtractively with a linear value term. We need a more sophisticated approach where the influence of the second parameter is mathematically distinct from the first across the data space, particularly for unfair offers, but in a way that allows for reliable estimation.

The challenge for this run is to leverage the insights from previous successes (e.g., the value term often has better recovery when structured linearly, and lower BIC suggests the combination of value and fairness is important) while fundamentally redesigning the second parameter's role to ensure its identifiability. The simple additive/subtractive structure `U = beta_value * ValueTerm Â± beta_unfairness * PenaltyTerm` where PenaltyTerm is a function of deviation seems insufficient.

We need to find a mathematical structure for utility, still using exactly **2 learnable parameters**, where their influence on responder decisions (`trial_role == 1`) is profoundly separable and distinguishable. Given the failure of the cubic penalty term, consider strategies that move beyond simply scaling a pre-calculated non-linear deviation:

Think **"Out of the Box"**: You have a tendency to propose models that are variations of `Value + Penalty`. While this class of models is relevant, the specific implementations tried so far have failed on parameter recovery for the second parameter. The negative recovery for `beta_unfairness` is a clear sign that the cubic penalty term is not working as intended for identifiability. Explore structures where the two parameters interact with the variables in a fundamentally different mathematical way, or where the second parameter's influence is integrated into the model structure differently.

Consider alternative strategies for incorporating the second parameter, focusing on mathematical distinctiveness from the first parameter's influence (likely still tied to `split_perc_self`):

*   **Non-linear Weighting/Modulation:** Instead of scaling a separate penalty term, could the second parameter **non-linearly modulate the weight or sensitivity** of the `split_perc_self` term itself based on fairness? For example, `U = beta_value * split_perc_self * f(fair_perc_self_calc, split_perc_self, beta_unfairness)`, where `f` is a non-linear function that is 1 when the offer is fair/favorable and decreases rapidly as unfairness increases, controlled by `beta_unfairness`. This integrates the fairness sensitivity directly into the value term's contribution.
*   **Ratio-based Utility:** Can utility be structured based on ratios of `split_perc_self` and `fair_perc_self_calc` directly, perhaps scaled by the two parameters? E.g., `U = beta_value * log(split_perc_self + epsilon) + beta_unfairness * log((split_perc_self + epsilon) / (fair_perc_self_calc + epsilon))` or similar ratio-based forms that inherently capture relative value and fairness, each scaled by a different parameter.
*   **Hybrid Non-linearities:** Combine different non-linear functions in a novel way. For instance, one parameter scales a term involving an exponential or logarithmic function of the deviation/ratio, while the other scales a simpler function.
*   **Threshold-Influencing Parameter:** While predicting utility, could one parameter influence the "baseline" utility and the other parameter influence how far below fairness an offer must be before a strong, non-linear rejection pressure kicks in? This might involve piecewise functions with non-linear slopes or intercepts influenced by the second parameter.

The goal is to design a utility calculation `U` involving `split_perc_self`, `fair_perc_self_calc` (derived from `token_self`, `token_opp`), and exactly two learnable parameters (`beta_X`, `beta_Y`) such that the influence of `beta_X` on `U` is as mathematically independent from the influence of `beta_Y` as possible across the range of `split_perc_self` and `fair_perc_self_calc` values in the data, particularly focusing on making the second parameter's effect pronounced and non-linear specifically in the unfair regime, but in a way that *is* recoverable.

*   **Key Inputs & Calculated Variables:** Use `split_perc_self`, `token_self`, `token_opp` as data variables. Calculate `sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc`, and any other necessary intermediate variables. Ensure `fair_perc_self_calc` handles `sum_tokens == 0` correctly (defaulting to 0.5). Use a small epsilon (`1e-6` or similar) for numerical stability if needed (e.g., denominators, logarithms).
*   **Model Formula:** Define `U`. Include calculation steps for derived variables *before* the formula for `U`. Use clear mathematical notation within the <MODEL> tags (only the formula).
*   **Learnable Parameters:** Exactly **2 learnable parameters**. Choose descriptive, Python-safe names. Define clear, generous, finite numerical bounds (e.g., [-10.0, 10.0], [-50.0, 50.0], [0.0, 100.0], etc. appropriate for the scale of their influence).
*   **Calculated Variables:** Include descriptions for *all* calculated variables used in the model (including U) with `source: "calculated"`. Include descriptions for all data variables used as inputs (`token_self`, `token_opp`, `split_perc_self`) with `source: "data"`.
*   **Variable Descriptions:** Provide variable descriptions in JSON format between <VARIABLES> tags for *all* variables in the <MODEL> formula. Include source, range (with inclusive flags), distribution (if applicable), and learnable status.
*   **Target Variable:** Specify "accept" using <target_variable> tags.
*   **Summary:** Provide a concise summary between <SUMMARY> tags. Describe the model's core idea and, crucially, explain *how its specific non-linear, asymmetric, or modulated mathematical structure is fundamentally different from simple additive/subtractive penalties and how this difference is intended to ensure robust parameter identifiability for *both* learnable parameters*. Explicitly contrast it with the failed cubic penalty approach and explain why the new structure should allow for better recovery of the second parameter.

Available Data Variables:
- trial_type, trial_role, token_opp, token_self, combined_earning, split_opp, split_self, splitperc_opp, split_perc_self, accept, accepted_amount, accepted_perc, proposed_perc, proposed_amount.
(Note: Use `split_perc_self` for the participant's proposed percentage share percentage).

Please think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions. Remember that robust parameter identifiability for *both* learnable parameters (>= 0.7 recovery for both) is the absolute priority. The excellent BIC and value recovery of the previous run are positive signs, but the second parameter's failure means that specific structure isn't the final answer. Your goal is to find a structure where both parameters' influences are clearly distinguishable across the range of possible offers, leading to reliable estimates. Be creative and explore structures that move beyond simple penalty scaling.
