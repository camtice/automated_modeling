For example, avoid Python reserved words like 'lambda' and use alternatives like 'learning_rate' or 'lambda_param'.\n\nModel Type:\nYour model should predict the utility of a binary choice. The utility will be converted to a probability using a logistic function with temperature 1, and then used to predict binary decisions.\n\nInstructions: Okay, here are the improved instructions for the next run (Run 82 of 100), based on the results of recent attempts.\n\nThe additive model with an exponential penalty tested in the previous run (Run 81) yielded a very high BIC (722.89) and poor parameter recovery for both learnable parameters (`beta_value` r=0.305, `beta_unfairness` r=0.281). This indicates that this specific additive structure with an exponential penalty failed to capture participant behavior accurately and did not resolve the parameter identifiability issue. This adds to the evidence from previous divisive models that simply changing the non-linear function within similar structures hasn't achieved the required joint parameter recovery.\n\nThe **unwavering primary objective remains achieving parameter recovery >= 0.7 for *all* learnable parameters**. A model structure that allows for reliable estimation of *all* its parameters is essential for meaningful interpretation of individual differences and group effects (like the impact of cocaine). We must continue to explore structures where the influences of *both* `beta_value` and `beta_unfairness` are mathematically separable enough for reliable joint estimation.\n\nLet's continue exploring additive structures, but introduce different non-linearities. Instead of a linear gain term and an exponential penalty, we will try a structure with a *non-linear gain term* and a *linear penalty term*. This asymmetry in functional form, where one parameter scales a diminishing-returns-like gain and the other scales a constant-rate penalty, is hypothesized to create more distinct parameter influence profiles compared to previous attempts.\n\nFor Run 82, we will test an additive model where the utility is determined by a positive, *logarithmic* term related to the participant's proposed share (`split_perc_self`), and a negative, *linear* penalty term related to the offer's unfairness (`loss_below_fair`).\n\nProposed Model Structure: An additive utility model where the utility of accepting (`U_accept`) is calculated as a logarithmic function of the participant's proposed percentage (`split_perc_self`), scaled by `beta_value`, *minus* a linear penalty term based on `loss_below_fair`, scaled by `beta_unfairness`.\n\nHere are the calculation steps:\nCalculate `sum_tokens = token_self + token_opp`.\nCalculate `fair_perc_self_calc` handling the `sum_tokens == 0` case (defaulting to 50.0), using `token_self` and `token_opp` from the data.\nCalculate `loss_below_fair = Max(0.0, fair_perc_self_calc - split_perc_self)`. This term is non-zero only for offers below or equal to the fair share.\nCalculate the utility: `U_accept = beta_value * Log(1.0 + split_perc_self) - beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair`.\nThe gain term uses `Log()` (natural logarithm). We add 1.0 to `split_perc_self` inside the log to handle the case where `split_perc_self` is 0, as `Log(0)` is undefined. This also implies diminishing marginal utility for higher percentage shares. The penalty term is simply linear in `loss_below_fair`, scaled by `beta_unfairness`.\n\nIn this structure, `beta_value` represents the sensitivity to the logarithmic value of the proposed percentage share (the potential gain), while `beta_unfairness` represents the strength of a linear penalty for offers below the fair share. The hypothesis is that combining a concave (logarithmic) gain function scaled by `beta_value` with a simple linear penalty function scaled by `beta_unfairness` will yield sufficiently distinct functional forms and influence profiles for each parameter across different offers to allow for robust joint identifiability, addressing the failures seen in previous, more correlated model structures. This also explores a different combination of functional forms (log + linear) compared to previous attempts (linear + exponential, various divisive forms).\n\nDesign the model using this new additive structure with a logarithmic gain and linear penalty: `U_accept = beta_value * Log(1.0 + split_perc_self) - beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair`. Remember to calculate intermediate variables (`sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc`, `loss_below_fair`) before the final `U_accept`. Use clear mathematical notation within the <MODEL> tags (only the formula). Use `Log()` for the natural logarithm function and `Max()` for the maximum function.\n\nFocus on clearly defining all intermediate terms and articulating in the summary how this specific additive structure, by combining a logarithmic gain term scaled by `beta_value` with a linear penalty term based on `loss_below_fair` scaled by `beta_unfairness`, is specifically intended to improve robust parameter identifiability for *both* parameters by creating mathematically distinct and separable influence profiles, exploring a different asymmetry in functional forms.\n\n*   **Key Inputs & Calculated Variables:** Use `split_perc_self`, `token_self`, `token_opp` as data variables. Calculate `sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc` (handling `sum_tokens == 0`), `loss_below_fair`, and `U_accept`. Include calculation steps for derived variables *before* the formula for `U_accept`.\n*   **Learnable Parameters:** Exactly **2 learnable parameters**: `beta_value` (logarithmic gain sensitivity) and `beta_unfairness` (linear penalty strength). Choose descriptive, Python-safe names. Define clear, generous, finite numerical bounds. Non-negative bounds (e.g., `[0.0, 100.0]` for both) are appropriate. `beta_value` should be non-negative for increasing utility with gain; `beta_unfairness` should be non-negative for the penalty to reduce utility. Stick with `[0.0, 100.0]` for both.\n*   **Calculated Variables:** Include descriptions for *all* calculated variables used in the model (including `U_accept`, `sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc`, and `loss_below_fair`) with `source: \"calculated\"`. Include descriptions for all data variables used as inputs (`token_self`, `token_opp`, `split_perc_self`) with `source: \"data\"`.\n*   **Variable Descriptions:** Provide variable descriptions in JSON format between <VARIABLES> tags for *all* variables in the <MODEL> formula. Include source, range (with inclusive flags), distribution (if applicable), and learnable status. Remember variable names must exactly match the model.\n*   **Target Variable:** Specify \"accept\" using <target_variable> tags.\n*   **Summary:** Provide a concise summary between <SUMMARY> tags. Describe the model\\'s core idea (additive structure where utility from `split_perc_self` is transformed logarithmically and reduced by a linear penalty based on `loss_below_fair`). Crucially, explain *how* this specific additive structure, combining a logarithmic gain term scaled by `beta_value` and a linear penalty term based on `loss_below_fair` scaled by `beta_unfairness`, is specifically intended to improve robust parameter identifiability for *both* parameters by creating mathematically distinct and separable influence profiles compared to previous models.\n*   **Think Outside the Box:** Parameter identifiability for *both* parameters simultaneously remains the persistent, difficult challenge. Neither the divisive structures tested so far nor the additive-exponential structure have solved this. This new additive logarithmic-linear structure is another attempt to find mathematically separable influences. If this also fails to achieve >= 0.7 recovery for *both* parameters, the next iteration *must* consider even more fundamentally different approaches to how the parameters influence the decision process or how fairness is evaluated and penalized. Could one parameter affect the *comparison* process itself? Could parameters relate to thresholds or reference points? Could the model structure explicitly compare utility of accepting vs. rejecting in a non-standard way? Continue to focus intently on finding a functional form where varying `beta_value` has a clearly distinguishable effect on the utility curve across offers compared to varying `beta_unfairness`, allowing them to be estimated independently with high reliability, which is a prerequisite for better fit metrics.\n\nAvailable Data Variables:\n- trial_type, trial_role, token_opp, token_self, combined_earning, split_opp, split_self, splitperc_opp, split_perc_self, accept, accepted_amount, accepted_perc, proposed_perc, proposed_amount.\n(Note: Use `split_perc_self` for the participant's proposed percentage share percentage).\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions. Remember that robust parameter identifiability for *both* learnable parameters (>= 0.7 recovery for both) is the absolute priority. Your goal is to find a structure where both parameters' influences are clearly distinguishable and interact in a way that allows for reliable estimation for *both* parameters, ideally leading to improved fit metrics (BIC and accuracy) as a result of capturing the underlying process more accurately.\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions.",

No description of the model should be provided within the <MODEL> tags.\n\nThe parameter names you choose in your <VARIABLES> section will be used exactly as specified in subsequent code generation. Please choose clear, non-reserved parameter names that can be used directly in Python code. For example, avoid Python reserved words like 'lambda' and use alternatives like 'learning_rate' or 'lambda_param'.\n\nModel Type: \nYour model should predict the utility of a binary choice. The utility will be converted to a probability using a logistic function with temperature 1, and then used to predict binary decisions.\n\n\nInstructions: Okay, here are the improved instructions for the next run (Run 82 of 100), based on the results of recent attempts.\n\nTask Description: In this ultimatum game experiment, the participant acts as both a proposer and a responsder. They are the proposer 14 times and the responsder 36 times. Each is designated by a trial number in the data set. There is also a pretask where the participant finds a number of tokens that correspond to their contribution to the group. This is designated by the variable \"token_self\". The other variable, \"token_opp\", is the number of tokens found the opponent's and represents the opoonents contribution to the shared pot that will be later divided by the opponent. The rounds are a mixed, with the participant doing a handful of turns as a responder, then a handful as a proposer, and then a handful as a responder, and so on.\n\nAgain, the participant gets to act as both a proposer and responder - this is reflected in the data. If you are guessing the proposed amount, you should only be making this guess when trial_role == 2, since this is when the data within the proposed_perc and proposed_amount columns are relevent.\n\nNote that in each trial there is a variable amount of money in the combined earning, so that two equal split_self variables do not represent the same \"fairness\".\n\nBelow is the description of each variable in the dataset:\n\ntrial_type = how much was the contribution [1 = equal, 2 = opponent more, 3 = participant more]\ntrial_role = the role of the participant [1 = responder, 2 = proposer]\ntoken_opp = number of tokens found by the opponent\ntoken_self = number of tokens found by the participant\ncombined_earning = amount of money earned in total (note that each token found is \u00a33)\nsplit_opp = the proposed share of the opponent (in \u00a3)\nsplit_self = the proposed share for the participant (in \u00a3)\nsplitperc_opp = same but in %\nsplit_perc_self = same but in %\naccept = whether the participant responded accept (1) or reject (0)\naccepted_amount = if accepted, what is the amount gain (in \u00a3)\naccepted_perc = same as above but in %\nproposed_perc = when participant is the proposer, what is the % proposed to the opponent\nproposed_amount = when participant is the proposer, what is the amount proposed to the opponent (in \u00a3)\n\nDesired Output Specification: Design a computational model for the described task. Your model should utilyze the given variables appropriately (but not necessarily all unless otherwise specified).\n\nThe model should:\n1. Predict only responder behavior (should target \"accept = whether the participant responded accept (1) or reject (0)\")\n2. You will have to pass parameter recovery tests. This should be roughly equal in priority to accuracy.\n3. Be applicable to the dataset given within the task description (i.e. the model should be able to be run using only the provided dataset structure).\n4. Predict utility, where less than 0 is less than 50% likely.\n\nFor any learnable parameters in your model, you must specify finite numerical bounds (it just can not be infinity) in the variable descriptions. However, this bound should be generous. The utility variable may be unbounded (-inf to inf).\n\nThen, provide your formal mathematical model between <MODEL> tags, followed by variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> tags. Additionally, specify the target variable that your model will predict. This should be one of the variables from the dataset above. Enclose it in <target_variable> tags.\nFor example: <target_variable>accept</target_variable> if your model is predicting whether a participant accepts or rejects a proposal.\n\nUse clear mathematical notation and ensure each variable is fully described. Every variable must be utilized within the mathematical formula provided between <MODEL> and </MODEL>, and only strictly the mathematical formula should be provided between these tags with no filler words or descriptions. For variable descriptions, provide them in a JSON format with the following structure: <VARIABLES> Bounds are by default inclusive. Please spell out the greek variable names instead of using the symbols. Finally, you should provide a short description of the model in the summary tags <SUMMARY> </SUMMARY>. This will be used to compare different computational models of the task; it should be concise and purely descriptive.

The utility will be converted to a probability using a logistic function with temperature 1, and then used to predict binary decisions.\n\nInstructions: Okay, here are the improved instructions for the next run (Run 82 of 100), based on the results of recent attempts.\n\nThe additive model with an exponential penalty tested in the previous run (Run 81) yielded a very high BIC (722.89) and poor parameter recovery for both learnable parameters (`beta_value` r=0.305, `beta_unfairness` r=0.281). This indicates that this specific additive structure with an exponential penalty failed to capture participant behavior accurately and did not resolve the parameter identifiability issue. This adds to the evidence from previous divisive models that simply changing the non-linear function within similar structures hasn't achieved the required joint parameter recovery.\n\nThe **unwavering primary objective remains achieving parameter recovery >= 0.7 for *all* learnable parameters**. A model structure that allows for reliable estimation of *all* its parameters is essential for meaningful interpretation of individual differences and group effects (like the impact of cocaine). We must continue to explore structures where the influences of *both* `beta_value` and `beta_unfairness` are mathematically separable enough for reliable joint estimation.\n\nLet's continue exploring additive structures, but introduce different non-linearities. Instead of a linear gain term and an exponential penalty, we will try a structure with a *non-linear gain term* and a *linear penalty term*. This asymmetry in functional form, where one parameter scales a diminishing-returns-like gain and the other scales a constant-rate penalty, is hypothesized to create more distinct parameter influence profiles compared to previous attempts.\n\nFor Run 82, we will test an additive model where the utility is determined by a positive, *logarithmic* term related to the participant's proposed share (`split_perc_self`), and a negative, *linear* penalty term related to the offer's unfairness (`loss_below_fair`).\n\nProposed Model Structure: An additive utility model where the utility of accepting (`U_accept`) is calculated as a logarithmic function of the participant's proposed percentage (`split_perc_self`), scaled by `beta_value`, *minus* a linear penalty term based on `loss_below_fair`, scaled by `beta_unfairness`.\n\nHere are the calculation steps:\nCalculate `sum_tokens = token_self + token_opp`.\nCalculate `fair_perc_self_calc` handling the `sum_tokens == 0` case (defaulting to 50.0), using `token_self` and `token_opp` from the data.\nCalculate `loss_below_fair = Max(0.0, fair_perc_self_calc - split_perc_self)`. This term is non-zero only for offers below or equal to the fair share.\nCalculate the utility: `U_accept = beta_value * Log(1.0 + split_perc_self) - beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair`.\nThe gain term uses `Log()` (natural logarithm). We add 1.0 to `split_perc_self` inside the log to handle the case where `split_perc_self` is 0, as `Log(0)` is undefined. This also implies diminishing marginal utility for higher percentage shares. The penalty term is simply linear in `loss_below_fair`, scaled by `beta_unfairness`.\n\nIn this structure, `beta_value` represents the sensitivity to the logarithmic value of the proposed percentage share (the potential gain), while `beta_unfairness` represents the strength of a linear penalty for offers below the fair share. The hypothesis is that combining a concave (logarithmic) gain function scaled by `beta_value` with a simple linear penalty function scaled by `beta_unfairness` will yield sufficiently distinct functional forms and influence profiles for each parameter across different offers to allow for robust joint identifiability, addressing the failures seen in previous, more correlated model structures. This also explores a different combination of functional forms (log + linear) compared to previous attempts (linear + exponential, various divisive forms).\n\nDesign the model using this new additive structure with a logarithmic gain and linear penalty: `U_accept = beta_value * Log(1.0 + split_perc_self) - beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair`. Remember to calculate intermediate variables (`sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc`, `loss_below_fair`) before the final `U_accept`. Use clear mathematical notation within the <MODEL> tags (only the formula). Use `Log()` for the natural logarithm function and `Max()` for the maximum function.\n\nFocus on clearly defining all intermediate terms and articulating in the summary how this specific additive structure, by combining a logarithmic gain term scaled by `beta_value` with a linear penalty term based on `loss_below_fair` scaled by `beta_unfairness`, is specifically intended to improve robust parameter identifiability for *both* parameters by creating mathematically distinct and separable influence profiles, exploring a different asymmetry in functional forms.\n\n*   **Key Inputs & Calculated Variables:** Use `split_perc_self`, `token_self`, `token_opp` as data variables. Calculate `sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc` (handling `sum_tokens == 0`), `loss_below_fair`, and `U_accept`. Include calculation steps for derived variables *before* the formula for `U_accept`.\n*   **Learnable Parameters:** Exactly **2 learnable parameters**: `beta_value` (logarithmic gain sensitivity) and `beta_unfairness` (linear penalty strength). Choose descriptive, Python-safe names. Define clear, generous, finite numerical bounds. Non-negative bounds (e.g., `[0.0, 100.0]` for both) are appropriate. `beta_value` should be non-negative for increasing utility with gain; `beta_unfairness` should be non-negative for the penalty to reduce utility. Stick with `[0.0, 100.0]` for both.\n*   **Calculated Variables:** Include descriptions for *all* calculated variables used in the model (including `U_accept`, `sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc`, and `loss_below_fair`) with `source: \"calculated\"`. Include descriptions for all data variables used as inputs (`token_self`, `token_opp`, `split_perc_self`) with `source: \"data\"`.\n*   **Variable Descriptions:** Provide variable descriptions in JSON format between <VARIABLES> tags for *all* variables in the <MODEL> formula. Include source, range (with inclusive flags), distribution (if applicable), and learnable status. Remember variable names must exactly match the model.\n*   **Target Variable:** Specify \"accept\" using <target_variable> tags.\n*   **Summary:** Provide a concise summary between <SUMMARY> tags. Describe the model\\'s core idea (additive structure where utility from `split_perc_self` is transformed logarithmically and reduced by a linear penalty based on `loss_below_fair`). Crucially, explain *how* this specific additive structure, combining a logarithmic gain term scaled by `beta_value` and a linear penalty term based on `loss_below_fair` scaled by `beta_unfairness`, is specifically intended to improve robust parameter identifiability for *both* parameters by creating mathematically distinct and separable influence profiles compared to previous models.\n*   **Think Outside the Box:** Parameter identifiability for *both* parameters simultaneously remains the persistent, difficult challenge. Neither the divisive structures tested so far nor the additive-exponential structure have solved this. This new additive logarithmic-linear structure is another attempt to find mathematically separable influences. If this also fails to achieve >= 0.7 recovery for *both* parameters, the next iteration *must* consider even more fundamentally different approaches to how the parameters influence the decision process or how fairness is evaluated and penalized. Could one parameter affect the *comparison* process itself? Could parameters relate to thresholds or reference points? Could the model structure explicitly compare utility of accepting vs. rejecting in a non-standard way? Continue to focus intently on finding a functional form where varying `beta_value` has a clearly distinguishable effect on the utility curve across offers compared to varying `beta_unfairness`, allowing them to be estimated independently with high reliability, which is a prerequisite for better fit metrics.\n\nAvailable Data Variables:\n- trial_type, trial_role, token_opp, token_self, combined_earning, split_opp, split_self, splitperc_opp, split_perc_self, accept, accepted_amount, accepted_perc, proposed_perc, proposed_amount.\n(Note: Use `split_perc_self` for the participant's proposed percentage share percentage).\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions. Remember that robust parameter identifiability for *both* learnable parameters (>= 0.7 recovery for both) is the absolute priority. Your goal is to find a structure where both parameters' influences are clearly distinguishable and interact in a way that allows for reliable estimation for *both* parameters, ideally leading to improved fit metrics (BIC and accuracy) as a result of capturing the underlying process more accurately.\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions.\n\nPrevious Models:Not Provided\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions.",

The utility of accepting is calculated as the sum of a positive gain term and a negative penalty term. The gain term is the natural logarithm of (1 + proposed share percentage for self), scaled by beta_value. The penalty term is a linear function of the loss below the calculated fair share percentage, scaled by beta_unfairness. The fair share is calculated based on token contributions, defaulting to 50% if total tokens are zero. This structure, combining a concave (logarithmic) gain function with a linear penalty function, is hypothesized to create sufficiently distinct influence profiles for the two learnable parameters (beta_value and beta_unfairness) to improve robust parameter identifiability compared to previous models.\nTarget Variable: accept\nPrediction Type: utility\nBIC: 448.6584091759732\nOverall Accuracy: 0.7149\nGroup Accuracies:\n- Control: 0.7590\n- Cocaine: 0.6753\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- beta_value: r = 0.315\n- beta_unfairness: r = 0.431"
