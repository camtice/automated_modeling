The utility will be converted to a probability using a logistic function with temperature 1, and then used to predict binary decisions.\n\nInstructions: Okay, here are the improved instructions for the next run (Run 84 of 100), based on the results of recent attempts.\n\nThe previous run (Run 83), which used an additive structure combining absolute percentage gain and relative fairness deviation (`U_accept = beta_value * split_perc_self + beta_unfairness * (relative_fairness - 1.0)`), resulted in extremely poor parameter recovery for *both* learnable parameters (`beta_value` r=-0.043, `beta_unfairness` r=0.048). This demonstrates that this specific structure failed completely to create separable influences for the parameters, leading to unreliable estimation. The BIC (595.90) and accuracy (0.615) were also poor, indicating a poor fit to the data.\n\nThis confirms the ongoing challenge: finding a model structure where the influences of *both* `beta_value` and `beta_unfairness` are mathematically distinct enough across trials to allow for robust parameter identifiability (parameter recovery >= 0.7 for *all* learnable parameters). Simply trying different linear or simple non-linear combinations of standard gain and penalty or absolute and relative terms has not achieved this crucial joint identifiability.\n\nThe **unwavering primary objective remains achieving parameter recovery >= 0.7 for *all* learnable parameters**. A model structure that allows for reliable estimation of *all* its parameters is essential for meaningful interpretation of individual differences and group effects.\n\nGiven the repeated failures of previous structures, including the one in Run 83, we need to explore a fundamentally different way the parameters interact or influence the utility calculation. Instead of additive terms, let's consider a structure where the fairness penalty *modulates* the value derived from the proposed gain in a multiplicative or divisive manner, with each parameter scaling a different aspect of this interaction.\n\nFor Run 84, we will test a model structure where the utility derived from the proposed percentage gain (`split_perc_self`, scaled by `beta_value`) is penalized divisively by a term related to how far the offer is *below* the calculated fair share (`loss_below_fair`, scaled by `beta_unfairness`). This introduces a multiplicative interaction between the core gain term and the penalty term's influence, which might create more distinct parameter profiles than previous additive or simple divisive structures.\n\nProposed Model Structure: The utility of accepting (`U_accept`) is calculated as the product of the participant's proposed percentage (`split_perc_self`, scaled by `beta_value`) and a penalty factor based on the amount the offer is below the calculated fair share (`loss_below_fair`, scaled by `beta_unfairness`). The penalty factor will be `1.0 / (1.0 + beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair)`.\n\nHere are the calculation steps:\n1. Calculate `sum_tokens = token_self + token_opp`.\n2. Calculate `fair_perc_self_calc` handling the `sum_tokens == 0` case (defaulting to 50.0), using `token_self` and `token_opp` from the data. Use `IF` for the conditional calculation.\n3. Calculate `loss_below_fair = Max(0.0, fair_perc_self_calc - split_perc_self)`. This term is 0 if the offer is fair or above fair, and positive if the offer is below fair, representing the degree of perceived loss or unfairness. Use `Max` for this calculation.\n4. Calculate the utility: `U_accept = beta_value * split_perc_self * (1.0 / (1.0 + beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair))`.\nIn this structure, `beta_value` scales the initial potential utility from the offer amount. `beta_unfairness` scales the `loss_below_fair` term, and the term `(1.0 + beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair)` acts as a denominator for the penalty factor `(1.0 / ...)`, which then *multiplies* the scaled gain. This multiplicative relationship between the scaled gain (`beta_value * split_perc_self`) and the fairness penalty factor `(1.0 / (1.0 + beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair))` is hypothesized to generate mathematically distinct influence profiles for `beta_value` (overall sensitivity to scaled offer) and `beta_unfairness` (sensitivity to how unfairness penalizes that scaled offer), potentially improving robust joint parameter identifiability.\n\nDesign the model using this new multiplicative/divisive structure combining scaled absolute gain and a divisive fairness penalty factor: `U_accept = beta_value * split_perc_self * (1.0 / (1.0 + beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair))`. Remember to calculate intermediate variables (`sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc`, `loss_below_fair`) before the final `U_accept`. Use clear mathematical notation within the <MODEL> tags (only the formula), using `IF` and `Max` as shown.\n\nFocus on clearly defining all intermediate terms and articulating in the summary how this specific multiplicative/divisive structure, where a gain term (scaled by `beta_value`) is multiplied by a penalty factor derived from `loss_below_fair` (scaled by `beta_unfairness`), is specifically intended to improve robust parameter identifiability for *both* parameters by creating mathematically distinct and separable influence profiles compared to previous models.\n\n*   **Key Inputs & Calculated Variables:** Use `split_perc_self`, `token_self`, `token_opp` as data variables. Calculate `sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc` (handling `sum_tokens == 0`), `loss_below_fair`, and `U_accept`. Include calculation steps for derived variables *before* the formula for `U_accept`.\n*   **Learnable Parameters:** Exactly **2 learnable parameters**: `beta_value` (sensitivity to absolute percentage gain) and `beta_unfairness` (sensitivity to how loss below fair penalizes the scaled gain). Choose descriptive, Python-safe names. Define clear, generous, finite numerical bounds. Non-negative bounds (e.g., `[0.0, 100.0]` for both) are appropriate. `beta_value` should be non-negative for increasing utility with percentage; `beta_unfairness` non-negative ensures the penalty factor decreases (or stays at 1) as `loss_below_fair` increases. Stick with `[0.0, 100.0]` for both.\n*   **Calculated Variables:** Include descriptions for *all* calculated variables used in the model (including `U_accept`, `sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc`, and `loss_below_fair`) with `source: \"calculated\"`. Include descriptions for all data variables used as inputs (`token_self`, `token_opp`, `split_perc_self`) with `source: \"data\"`.\n*   **Variable Descriptions:** Provide variable descriptions in JSON format between <VARIABLES> tags for *all* variables in the <MODEL> formula. Include source, range (with inclusive flags), distribution (if applicable), and learnable status. Remember variable names must exactly match the model formula and data descriptions.\n*   **Target Variable:** Specify \"accept\" using <target_variable> tags.\n*   **Summary:** Provide a concise summary between <SUMMARY> tags. Describe the model's core idea (utility is a scaled gain term multiplied by a penalty factor based on unfairness). Crucially, explain *how* this specific multiplicative/divisive structure, where the scaled gain is penalized by a factor based on `loss_below_fair` scaled by `beta_unfairness`, is specifically intended to improve robust parameter identifiability for *both* parameters by creating mathematically distinct and separable influence profiles compared to previous models.\n*   **Think Outside the Box:** Parameter identifiability for *both* parameters simultaneously remains the persistent, difficult challenge. Neither the divisive structures nor the simple additive gain/penalty or absolute/relative variations tested have solved this. This new multiplicative/divisive structure is another attempt to find mathematically separable influences through a different type of parameter interaction. If this also fails to achieve >= 0.7 recovery for *both* parameters, the next iteration *must* consider even more fundamentally different structural approaches. Continue to focus intently on finding a functional form where varying `beta_value` has a clearly distinguishable effect on the utility curve across offers compared to varying `beta_unfairness`, allowing them to be estimated independently with high reliability, which is a prerequisite for better fit metrics. Consider models where parameters influence thresholding, decision-making rules, or alternative ways of conceptualizing and integrating fairness beyond standard additive or multiplicative structures. Think about how parameters could influence the exponent of a term, or scale terms that are then passed into a non-linear function together, or how parameters could determine which decision rule is applied.\n\nAvailable Data Variables:\n- trial_type, trial_role, token_opp, token_self, combined_earning, split_opp, split_self, splitperc_opp, split_perc_self, accept, accepted_amount, accepted_perc, proposed_perc, proposed_amount.\n(Note: Use `split_perc_self` for the participant's proposed percentage share percentage).\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions.

No description of the model should be provided within the <MODEL> tags.\n\nThe parameter names you choose in your <VARIABLES> section will be used exactly as specified in subsequent code generation. Please choose clear, non-reserved parameter names that can be used directly in Python code. For example, avoid Python reserved words like 'lambda' and use alternatives like 'learning_rate' or 'lambda_param'.\n\nModel Type: \nYour model should predict the utility of a binary choice. The utility will be converted to a probability using a logistic function with temperature 1, and then used to predict binary decisions.\n\n\nInstructions: Okay, here are the improved instructions for the next run (Run 84 of 100), based on the results of recent attempts.\n\nTask Description: In this ultimatum game experiment, the participant acts as both a proposer and a responsder. They are the proposer 14 times and the responsder 36 times. Each is designated by a trial number in the data set. There is also a pretask where the participant finds a number of tokens that correspond to their contribution to the group. This is designated by the variable \"token_self\". The other variable, \"token_opp\", is the number of tokens found the opponent's and represents the opoonents contribution to the shared pot that will be later divided by the opponent. The rounds are a mixed, with the participant doing a handful of turns as a responder, then a handful as a proposer, and then a handful as a responder, and so on.\n\nAgain, the participant gets to act as both a proposer and responder - this is reflected in the data. If you are guessing the proposed amount, you should only be making this guess when trial_role == 2, since this is when the data within the proposed_perc and proposed_amount columns are relevent.\n\nNote that in each trial there is a variable amount of money in the combined earning, so that two equal split_self variables do not represent the same \"fairness\".\n\nBelow is the description of each variable in the dataset:\n\ntrial_type = how much was the contribution [1 = equal, 2 = opponent more, 3 = participant more]\ntrial_role = the role of the participant [1 = responder, 2 = proposer]\ntoken_opp = number of tokens found by the opponent\ntoken_self = number of tokens found by the participant\ncombined_earning = amount of money earned in total (note that each token found is \u00a33)\nsplit_opp = the proposed share of the opponent (in \u00a3)\nsplit_self = the proposed share for the participant (in \u00a3)\nsplitperc_opp = same but in %\nsplit_perc_self = same but in %\naccept = whether the participant responded accept (1) or reject (0)\naccepted_amount = if accepted, what is the amount gain (in \u00a3)\naccepted_perc = same as above but in %\nproposed_perc = when participant is the proposer, what is the % proposed to the opponent\nproposed_amount = when participant is the proposer, what is the amount proposed to the opponent (in \u00a3)\n\nDesired Output Specification: Design a computational model for the described task. Your model should utilyze the given variables appropriately (but not necessarily all unless otherwise specified).\n\nThe model should:\n1. Predict only responder behavior (should target \"accept = whether the participant responded accept (1) or reject (0)\")\n2. You will have to pass parameter recovery tests. This should be roughly equal in priority to accuracy.\n3. Be applicable to the dataset given within the task description (i.e. the model should be able to be run using only the provided dataset structure).\n4. Predict utility, where less than 0 is less than 50% likely.\n\nFor any learnable parameters in your model, you must specify finite numerical bounds (it just can not be infinity) in the variable descriptions. However, this bound should be generous. The utility variable may be unbounded (-inf to inf).\n\nThen, provide your formal mathematical model between <MODEL> tags, followed by variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> tags. Additionally, specify the target variable that your model will predict. This should be one of the variables from the dataset above. Enclose it in <target_variable> tags.\nFor example: <target_variable>accept</target_variable> if your model is predicting whether a participant accepts or rejects a proposal.\n\nUse clear mathematical notation and ensure each variable is fully described. Every variable must be utilized within the mathematical formula provided between <MODEL> and </MODEL>, and only strictly the mathematical formula should be provided between these tags with no filler words or descriptions. For variable descriptions, provide them in a JSON format with the following structure: <VARIABLES> Bounds are by default inclusive. Please spell out the greek variable names instead of using the symbols. Finally, you should provide a short description of the model in the summary tags <SUMMARY> </SUMMARY>. This will be used to compare different computational models of the task; it should be concise and purely descriptive.

The utility will be converted to a probability using a logistic function with temperature 1, and then used to predict binary decisions.\n\nInstructions: Okay, here are the improved instructions for the next run (Run 84 of 100), based on the results of recent attempts.\n\nThe previous run (Run 83), which used an additive structure combining absolute percentage gain and relative fairness deviation (`U_accept = beta_value * split_perc_self + beta_unfairness * (relative_fairness - 1.0)`), resulted in extremely poor parameter recovery for *both* learnable parameters (`beta_value` r=-0.043, `beta_unfairness` r=0.048). This demonstrates that this specific structure failed completely to create separable influences for the parameters, leading to unreliable estimation. The BIC (595.90) and accuracy (0.615) were also poor, indicating a poor fit to the data.\n\nThis confirms the ongoing challenge: finding a model structure where the influences of *both* `beta_value` and `beta_unfairness` are mathematically distinct enough across trials to allow for robust parameter identifiability (parameter recovery >= 0.7 for *all* learnable parameters). Simply trying different linear or simple non-linear combinations of standard gain and penalty or absolute and relative terms has not achieved this crucial joint identifiability.\n\nThe **unwavering primary objective remains achieving parameter recovery >= 0.7 for *all* learnable parameters**. A model structure that allows for reliable estimation of *all* its parameters is essential for meaningful interpretation of individual differences and group effects.\n\nGiven the repeated failures of previous structures, including the one in Run 83, we need to explore a fundamentally different way the parameters interact or influence the utility calculation. Instead of additive terms, let's consider a structure where the fairness penalty *modulates* the value derived from the proposed gain in a multiplicative or divisive manner, with each parameter scaling a different aspect of this interaction.\n\nFor Run 84, we will test a model structure where the utility derived from the proposed percentage gain (`split_perc_self`, scaled by `beta_value`) is penalized divisively by a term related to how far the offer is *below* the calculated fair share (`loss_below_fair`, scaled by `beta_unfairness`). This introduces a multiplicative interaction between the core gain term and the penalty term's influence, which might create more distinct parameter profiles than previous additive or simple divisive structures.\n\nProposed Model Structure: The utility of accepting (`U_accept`) is calculated as the product of the participant's proposed percentage (`split_perc_self`, scaled by `beta_value`) and a penalty factor based on the amount the offer is below the calculated fair share (`loss_below_fair`, scaled by `beta_unfairness`). The penalty factor will be `1.0 / (1.0 + beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair)`.\n\nHere are the calculation steps:\n1. Calculate `sum_tokens = token_self + token_opp`.\n2. Calculate `fair_perc_self_calc` handling the `sum_tokens == 0` case (defaulting to 50.0), using `token_self` and `token_opp` from the data. Use `IF` for the conditional calculation.\n3. Calculate `loss_below_fair = Max(0.0, fair_perc_self_calc - split_perc_self)`. This term is 0 if the offer is fair or above fair, and positive if the offer is below fair, representing the degree of perceived loss or unfairness. Use `Max` for this calculation.\n4. Calculate the utility: `U_accept = beta_value * split_perc_self * (1.0 / (1.0 + beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair))`.\nIn this structure, `beta_value` scales the initial potential utility from the offer amount. `beta_unfairness` scales the `loss_below_fair` term, and the term `(1.0 + beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair)` acts as a denominator for the penalty factor `(1.0 / ...)`, which then *multiplies* the scaled gain. This multiplicative relationship between the scaled gain (`beta_value * split_perc_self`) and the fairness penalty factor `(1.0 / (1.0 + beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair))` is hypothesized to generate mathematically distinct influence profiles for `beta_value` (overall sensitivity to scaled offer) and `beta_unfairness` (sensitivity to how unfairness penalizes that scaled offer), potentially improving robust joint parameter identifiability.\n\nDesign the model using this new multiplicative/divisive structure combining scaled absolute gain and a divisive fairness penalty factor: `U_accept = beta_value * split_perc_self * (1.0 / (1.0 + beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair))`. Remember to calculate intermediate variables (`sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc`, `loss_below_fair`) before the final `U_accept`. Use clear mathematical notation within the <MODEL> tags (only the formula), using `IF` and `Max` as shown.\n\nFocus on clearly defining all intermediate terms and articulating in the summary how this specific multiplicative/divisive structure, where a gain term (scaled by `beta_value`) is multiplied by a penalty factor derived from `loss_below_fair` (scaled by `beta_unfairness`), is specifically intended to improve robust parameter identifiability for *both* parameters by creating mathematically distinct and separable influence profiles compared to previous models.\n\n*   **Key Inputs & Calculated Variables:** Use `split_perc_self`, `token_self`, `token_opp` as data variables. Calculate `sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc` (handling `sum_tokens == 0`), `loss_below_fair`, and `U_accept`. Include calculation steps for derived variables *before* the formula for `U_accept`.\n*   **Learnable Parameters:** Exactly **2 learnable parameters**: `beta_value` (sensitivity to absolute percentage gain) and `beta_unfairness` (sensitivity to how loss below fair penalizes the scaled gain). Choose descriptive, Python-safe names. Define clear, generous, finite numerical bounds. Non-negative bounds (e.g., `[0.0, 100.0]` for both) are appropriate. `beta_value` should be non-negative for increasing utility with percentage; `beta_unfairness` non-negative ensures the penalty factor decreases (or stays at 1) as `loss_below_fair` increases. Stick with `[0.0, 100.0]` for both.\n*   **Calculated Variables:** Include descriptions for *all* calculated variables used in the model (including `U_accept`, `sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc`, and `loss_below_fair`) with `source: \"calculated\"`. Include descriptions for all data variables used as inputs (`token_self`, `token_opp`, `split_perc_self`) with `source: \"data\"`.\n*   **Variable Descriptions:** Provide variable descriptions in JSON format between <VARIABLES> tags for *all* variables in the <MODEL> formula. Include source, range (with inclusive flags), distribution (if applicable), and learnable status. Remember variable names must exactly match the model formula and data descriptions.\n*   **Target Variable:** Specify \"accept\" using <target_variable> tags.\n*   **Summary:** Provide a concise summary between <SUMMARY> tags. Describe the model's core idea (utility is a scaled gain term multiplied by a penalty factor based on unfairness). Crucially, explain *how* this specific multiplicative/divisive structure, where the scaled gain is penalized by a factor based on `loss_below_fair` scaled by `beta_unfairness`, is specifically intended to improve robust parameter identifiability for *both* parameters by creating mathematically distinct and separable influence profiles compared to previous models.\n*   **Think Outside the Box:** Parameter identifiability for *both* parameters simultaneously remains the persistent, difficult challenge. Neither the divisive structures nor the simple additive gain/penalty or absolute/relative variations tested have solved this. This new multiplicative/divisive structure is another attempt to find mathematically separable influences through a different type of parameter interaction. If this also fails to achieve >= 0.7 recovery for *both* parameters, the next iteration *must* consider even more fundamentally different structural approaches. Continue to focus intently on finding a functional form where varying `beta_value` has a clearly distinguishable effect on the utility curve across offers compared to varying `beta_unfairness`, allowing them to be estimated independently with high reliability, which is a prerequisite for better fit metrics. Consider models where parameters influence thresholding, decision-making rules, or alternative ways of conceptualizing and integrating fairness beyond standard additive or multiplicative structures. Think about how parameters could influence the exponent of a term, or scale terms that are then passed into a non-linear function together, or how parameters could determine which decision rule is applied.\n\nAvailable Data Variables:\n- trial_type, trial_role, token_opp, token_self, combined_earning, split_opp, split_self, splitperc_opp, split_perc_self, accept, accepted_amount, accepted_perc, proposed_perc, proposed_amount.\n(Note: Use `split_perc_self` for the participant's proposed percentage share percentage).\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions. Remember that robust parameter identifiability for *both* learnable parameters (>= 0.7 recovery for both) is the absolute priority. Your goal is to find a structure where both parameters' influences are clearly distinguishable and interact in a way that allows for reliable estimation for *both* parameters, ideally leading to improved fit metrics (BIC and accuracy) as a result of capturing the underlying process more accurately.\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions.\n\nPrevious Models:Not Provided\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions.",

The utility is based on a multiplicative interaction between the participant's proposed percentage gain and a penalty factor related to perceived unfairness. The core utility is derived from the proposed percentage, scaled by 'beta_value'. This scaled gain is then multiplied by a penalty factor, which decreases as the amount the offer is below the calculated fair share ('loss_below_fair') increases. The 'loss_below_fair' is itself scaled by 'beta_unfairness'. This multiplicative structure, where the scaled gain is penalized by a factor based on scaled unfairness, is designed to improve robust parameter identifiability for both 'beta_value' and 'beta_unfairness' by creating mathematically distinct and separable influence profiles compared to previous additive or simple divisive models.\nTarget Variable: accept\nPrediction Type: utility\nBIC: 42.98741527686191\nOverall Accuracy: 0.6615\nGroup Accuracies:\n- Control: 0.7280\n- Cocaine: 0.6019\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- beta_value: r = 0.542\n- beta_unfairness: r = 0.507"
