The utility will be converted to a probability using a logistic function with temperature 1, and then used to predict binary decisions.\n\nInstructions: Okay, here are the improved instructions for the next run (Run 86 of 100), based on the results of recent attempts.\n\nThe previous run (Run 85), which used an additive structure combining a power-law gain term and a linear loss term (`U_accept = split_perc_self^beta_value - beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair`), resulted in very poor parameter recovery (r=0.128 for `beta_value`, r=0.013 for `beta_unfairness`). This structure, despite achieving relatively high accuracy (0.741) and a decent BIC (360.19), failed critically on the primary objective: robust parameter identifiability.\n\nReviewing previous runs, Run 84, which used a multiplicative structure where scaled percentage gain was multiplied by a divisive fairness penalty factor (`U_accept = beta_value * split_perc_self * (1.0 / (1.0 + beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair))`), showed the *best parameter recovery results so far* (r=0.542 for `beta_value`, r=0.507 for `beta_unfairness`), although still below the 0.7 threshold. It also achieved the lowest BIC (42.99) among recent models. This suggests that this multiplicative/divisive structure is the most promising candidate discovered thus far for achieving parameter identifiability in this task, even if it hasn't fully succeeded yet.\n\nThe **unwavering primary objective remains achieving parameter recovery >= 0.7 for *all* learnable parameters**. A model structure that allows for reliable estimation of *all* its parameters is essential for meaningful interpretation of individual differences and group effects, and overrides achieving a low BIC or high accuracy if recovery fails.\n\nGiven the relative success of the multiplicative structure from Run 84 compared to other attempts, we will revisit and implement this structure again for Run 86. The hypothesis is that the way `beta_value` scales the numerator (the gain term) and `beta_unfairness` scales a term in the denominator (the penalty factor) creates more distinct influence profiles on the overall utility function across trials than additive or power-law structures, making the parameters more independently identifiable.\n\nProposed Model Structure: The utility of accepting (`U_accept`) is calculated as a product of the participant's proposed percentage gain (`split_perc_self`, scaled by `beta_value`) and a penalty factor derived from the amount the offer is below the calculated fair share (`loss_below_fair`, scaled by `beta_unfairness`).\n\nHere are the calculation steps:\n1. Calculate `sum_tokens = token_self + token_opp`.\n2. Calculate `fair_perc_self_calc` handling the `sum_tokens == 0` case (defaulting to 50.0), using `token_self` and `token_opp` from the data. Use `IF` for the conditional calculation.\n3. Calculate `loss_below_fair = Max(0.0, fair_perc_self_calc - split_perc_self)`. This term is 0 if the offer is fair or above fair, and positive if the offer is below fair, representing the degree of perceived loss or unfairness. Use `Max` for this calculation.\n4. Calculate the utility using the multiplicative structure from Run 84: `U_accept = beta_value * split_perc_self * (1.0 / (1.0 + beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair))`. Use standard mathematical notation for multiplication and division.\n\nIn this structure, `beta_value` linearly scales the gain term derived from the proposed share. `beta_unfairness` scales the `loss_below_fair` term within the denominator of a penalty factor. This penalty factor decreases from 1 towards 0 as `loss_below_fair` increases. The utility is the scaled gain *multiplied* by this decreasing penalty factor. This differential influence \u2013 `beta_value` scaling the numerator (gain) and `beta_unfairness` affecting the denominator's decay rate (penalty) \u2013 is specifically intended to improve robust joint parameter identifiability for *both* parameters by creating mathematically distinct and separable influence profiles compared to previous models.\n\nDesign the model using this specific multiplicative/divisive structure: `U_accept = beta_value * split_perc_self * (1.0 / (1.0 + beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair))`. Remember to calculate intermediate variables (`sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc`, `loss_below_fair`) before the final `U_accept`. Use clear mathematical notation within the <MODEL> tags (only the formula), using `IF` and `Max`.\n\nFocus on clearly defining all intermediate terms and articulating in the summary how this specific multiplicative structure, where `beta_value` scales the base gain and `beta_unfairness` scales the penalty term within the denominator of a penalty factor, is specifically intended to improve robust parameter identifiability for *both* parameters by creating mathematically distinct and separable influence profiles compared to previous additive or simple divisive models.\n\n*   **Key Inputs & Calculated Variables:** Use `split_perc_self`, `token_self`, `token_opp` as data variables. Calculate `sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc` (handling `sum_tokens == 0`), `loss_below_fair`, and `U_accept`. Include calculation steps for derived variables *before* the formula for `U_accept`.\n*   **Learnable Parameters:** Exactly **2 learnable parameters**: `beta_value` (sensitivity/scaling parameter for percentage gain) and `beta_unfairness` (sensitivity/aversion parameter affecting the penalty factor). Choose descriptive, Python-safe names. Define clear, generous, finite numerical bounds.\n    *   `beta_value`: Non-negative bounds, e.g., `[0.01, 10.0]`. Must be > 0 to allow gain influence.\n    *   `beta_unfairness`: Non-negative bounds, e.g., `[0.0, 10.0]`. Must be >= 0 to represent aversion (or indifference).\n*   **Calculated Variables:** Include descriptions for *all* calculated variables used in the model (including `U_accept`, `sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc`, and `loss_below_fair`) with `source: \"calculated\"`. Include descriptions for all data variables used as inputs (`token_self`, `token_opp`, `split_perc_self`) with `source: \"data\"`.\n*   **Variable Descriptions:** Provide variable descriptions in JSON format between <VARIABLES> tags for *all* variables in the <MODEL> formula. Include source, range (with inclusive flags), distribution (if applicable), and learnable status. Remember variable names must exactly match the model formula and data descriptions.\n*   **Target Variable:** Specify \"accept\" using <target_variable> tags.\n*   **Summary:** Provide a concise summary between <SUMMARY> tags. Describe the model's core idea (utility is a scaled gain term multiplied by a penalty factor based on unfairness). Crucially, explain *how* this specific multiplicative structure, where `beta_value` scales the gain (numerator) and `beta_unfairness` affects the penalty factor's denominator, is specifically intended to improve robust parameter identifiability for *both* parameters by creating mathematically distinct and separable influence profiles compared to previous models.\n*   **Think Outside the Box:** Parameter identifiability for *both* parameters simultaneously remains the persistent, difficult challenge. While Run 84's structure showed the most promise so far, it still didn't reach the 0.7 recovery threshold for both. This re-attempt aims to confirm and hopefully improve upon that. If this specific multiplicative structure *still* fails to achieve >= 0.7 recovery for *both* parameters in Run 86, the next iteration *must* consider even more fundamentally different structural approaches that move beyond standard gain/loss formulations. Think about models where parameters might influence decision noise, contribute additively in log-space, define aspiration levels, or influence the choice process in a more qualitative way than just scaling utility components. Focus intently on finding a functional form where varying `beta_value` has a clearly distinguishable effect on the utility curve across offers compared to varying `beta_unfairness`, allowing them to be estimated independently with high reliability. This is a prerequisite for better fit metrics and meaningful interpretation.\n\nAvailable Data Variables:\n- trial_type, trial_role, token_opp, token_self, combined_earning, split_opp, split_self, splitperc_opp, split_perc_self, accept, accepted_amount, accepted_perc, proposed_perc, proposed_amount.\n(Note: Use `split_perc_self` for the participant's proposed percentage share percentage).\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions. Remember that robust parameter identifiability for *both* learnable parameters (>= 0.7 recovery for both) is the absolute priority. Your goal is to find a structure where both parameters' influences are clearly distinguishable and interact in a way that allows for reliable estimation for *both* parameters, ideally leading to improved fit metrics (BIC and accuracy) as a result of capturing the underlying process more accurately.\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions.",

No description of the model should be provided within the <MODEL> tags.\n\nThe parameter names you choose in your <VARIABLES> section will be used exactly as specified in subsequent code generation. Please choose clear, non-reserved parameter names that can be used directly in Python code. For example, avoid Python reserved words like 'lambda' and use alternatives like 'learning_rate' or 'lambda_param'.\n\nModel Type: \nYour model should predict the utility of a binary choice. The utility will be converted to a probability using a logistic function with temperature 1, and then used to predict binary decisions.\n\n\nInstructions: Okay, here are the improved instructions for the next run (Run 86 of 100), based on the results of recent attempts.\n\nTask Description: In this ultimatum game experiment, the participant acts as both a proposer and a responsder. They are the proposer 14 times and the responsder 36 times. Each is designated by a trial number in the data set. There is also a pretask where the participant finds a number of tokens that correspond to their contribution to the group. This is designated by the variable \"token_self\". The other variable, \"token_opp\", is the number of tokens found the opponent's and represents the opoonents contribution to the shared pot that will be later divided by the opponent. The rounds are a mixed, with the participant doing a handful of turns as a responder, then a handful as a proposer, and then a handful as a responder, and so on.\n\nAgain, the participant gets to act as both a proposer and responder - this is reflected in the data. If you are guessing the proposed amount, you should only be making this guess when trial_role == 2, since this is when the data within the proposed_perc and proposed_amount columns are relevent.\n\nNote that in each trial there is a variable amount of money in the combined earning, so that two equal split_self variables do not represent the same \"fairness\".\n\nBelow is the description of each variable in the dataset:\n\ntrial_type = how much was the contribution [1 = equal, 2 = opponent more, 3 = participant more]\ntrial_role = the role of the participant [1 = responder, 2 = proposer]\ntoken_opp = number of tokens found by the opponent\ntoken_self = number of tokens found by the participant\ncombined_earning = amount of money earned in total (note that each token found is \u00a33)\nsplit_opp = the proposed share of the opponent (in \u00a3)\nsplit_self = the proposed share for the participant (in \u00a3)\nsplitperc_opp = same but in %\nsplit_perc_self = same but in %\naccept = whether the participant responded accept (1) or reject (0)\naccepted_amount = if accepted, what is the amount gain (in \u00a3)\naccepted_perc = same as above but in %\nproposed_perc = when participant is the proposer, what is the % proposed to the opponent\nproposed_amount = when participant is the proposer, what is the amount proposed to the opponent (in \u00a3)\n\nDesired Output Specification: Design a computational model for the described task. Your model should utilyze the given variables appropriately (but not necessarily all unless otherwise specified).\n\nThe model should:\n1. Predict only responder behavior (should target \"accept = whether the participant responded accept (1) or reject (0)\")\n2. You will have to pass parameter recovery tests. This should be roughly equal in priority to accuracy.\n3. Be applicable to the dataset given within the task description (i.e. the model should be able to be run using only the provided dataset structure).\n4. Predict utility, where less than 0 is less than 50% likely.\n\nFor any learnable parameters in your model, you must specify finite numerical bounds (it just can not be infinity) in the variable descriptions. However, this bound should be generous. The utility variable may be unbounded (-inf to inf).\n\nThen, provide your formal mathematical model between <MODEL> tags, followed by variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> tags. Additionally, specify the target variable that your model will predict. This should be one of the variables from the dataset above. Enclose it in <target_variable> tags.\nFor example: <target_variable>accept</target_variable> if your model is predicting whether a participant accepts or rejects a proposal.\n\nUse clear mathematical notation and ensure each variable is fully described. Every variable must be utilized within the mathematical formula provided between <MODEL> and </MODEL>, and only strictly the mathematical formula should be provided between these tags with no filler words or descriptions. For variable descriptions, provide them in a JSON format with the following structure: <VARIABLES> Bounds are by default inclusive. Please spell out the greek variable names instead of using the symbols. Finally, you should provide a short description of the model in the summary tags <SUMMARY> </SUMMARY>. This will be used to compare different computational models of the task; it should be concise and purely descriptive.

The utility will be converted to a probability using a logistic function with temperature 1, and then used to predict binary decisions.\n\nInstructions: Okay, here are the improved instructions for the next run (Run 86 of 100), based on the results of recent attempts.\n\nThe previous run (Run 85), which used an additive structure combining a power-law gain term and a linear loss term (`U_accept = split_perc_self^beta_value - beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair`), resulted in very poor parameter recovery (r=0.128 for `beta_value`, r=0.013 for `beta_unfairness`). This structure, despite achieving relatively high accuracy (0.741) and a decent BIC (360.19), failed critically on the primary objective: robust parameter identifiability.\n\nReviewing previous runs, Run 84, which used a multiplicative structure where scaled percentage gain was multiplied by a divisive fairness penalty factor (`U_accept = beta_value * split_perc_self * (1.0 / (1.0 + beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair))`), showed the *best parameter recovery results so far* (r=0.542 for `beta_value`, r=0.507 for `beta_unfairness`), although still below the 0.7 threshold. It also achieved the lowest BIC (42.99) among recent models. This suggests that this multiplicative/divisive structure is the most promising candidate discovered thus far for achieving parameter identifiability in this task, even if it hasn't fully succeeded yet.\n\nThe **unwavering primary objective remains achieving parameter recovery >= 0.7 for *all* learnable parameters**. A model structure that allows for reliable estimation of *all* its parameters is essential for meaningful interpretation of individual differences and group effects, and overrides achieving a low BIC or high accuracy if recovery fails.\n\nGiven the relative success of the multiplicative structure from Run 84 compared to other attempts, we will revisit and implement this structure again for Run 86. The hypothesis is that the way `beta_value` scales the numerator (the gain term) and `beta_unfairness` scales a term in the denominator (the penalty factor) creates more distinct influence profiles on the overall utility function across trials than additive or power-law structures, making the parameters more independently identifiable.\n\nProposed Model Structure: The utility of accepting (`U_accept`) is calculated as a product of the participant's proposed percentage gain (`split_perc_self`, scaled by `beta_value`) and a penalty factor derived from the amount the offer is below the calculated fair share (`loss_below_fair`, scaled by `beta_unfairness`).\n\nHere are the calculation steps:\n1. Calculate `sum_tokens = token_self + token_opp`.\n2. Calculate `fair_perc_self_calc` handling the `sum_tokens == 0` case (defaulting to 50.0), using `token_self` and `token_opp` from the data. Use `IF` for the conditional calculation.\n3. Calculate `loss_below_fair = Max(0.0, fair_perc_self_calc - split_perc_self)`. This term is 0 if the offer is fair or above fair, and positive if the offer is below fair, representing the degree of perceived loss or unfairness. Use `Max` for this calculation.\n4. Calculate the utility using the multiplicative structure from Run 84: `U_accept = beta_value * split_perc_self * (1.0 / (1.0 + beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair))`. Use standard mathematical notation for multiplication and division.\n\nIn this structure, `beta_value` linearly scales the gain term derived from the proposed share. `beta_unfairness` scales the `loss_below_fair` term within the denominator of a penalty factor. This penalty factor decreases from 1 towards 0 as `loss_below_fair` increases. The utility is the scaled gain *multiplied* by this decreasing penalty factor. This differential influence \u2013 `beta_value` scaling the numerator (gain) and `beta_unfairness` affecting the denominator's decay rate (penalty) \u2013 is specifically intended to improve robust joint parameter identifiability for *both* parameters by creating mathematically distinct and separable influence profiles compared to previous models.\n\nDesign the model using this specific multiplicative/divisive structure: `U_accept = beta_value * split_perc_self * (1.0 / (1.0 + beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair))`. Remember to calculate intermediate variables (`sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc`, `loss_below_fair`) before the final `U_accept`. Use clear mathematical notation within the <MODEL> tags (only the formula), using `IF` and `Max`.\n\nFocus on clearly defining all intermediate terms and articulating in the summary how this specific multiplicative structure, where `beta_value` scales the base gain and `beta_unfairness` scales the penalty term within the denominator of a penalty factor, is specifically intended to improve robust parameter identifiability for *both* parameters by creating mathematically distinct and separable influence profiles compared to previous additive or simple divisive models.\n\n*   **Key Inputs & Calculated Variables:** Use `split_perc_self`, `token_self`, `token_opp` as data variables. Calculate `sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc` (handling `sum_tokens == 0`), `loss_below_fair`, and `U_accept`. Include calculation steps for derived variables *before* the formula for `U_accept`.\n*   **Learnable Parameters:** Exactly **2 learnable parameters**: `beta_value` (sensitivity/scaling parameter for percentage gain) and `beta_unfairness` (sensitivity/aversion parameter affecting the penalty factor). Choose descriptive, Python-safe names. Define clear, generous, finite numerical bounds.\n    *   `beta_value`: Non-negative bounds, e.g., `[0.01, 10.0]`. Must be > 0 to allow gain influence.\n    *   `beta_unfairness`: Non-negative bounds, e.g., `[0.0, 10.0]`. Must be >= 0 to represent aversion (or indifference).\n*   **Calculated Variables:** Include descriptions for *all* calculated variables used in the model (including `U_accept`, `sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc`, and `loss_below_fair`) with `source: \"calculated\"`. Include descriptions for all data variables used as inputs (`token_self`, `token_opp`, `split_perc_self`) with `source: \"data\"`.\n*   **Variable Descriptions:** Provide variable descriptions in JSON format between <VARIABLES> tags for *all* variables in the <MODEL> formula. Include source, range (with inclusive flags), distribution (if applicable), and learnable status. Remember variable names must exactly match the model formula and data descriptions.\n*   **Target Variable:** Specify \"accept\" using <target_variable> tags.\n*   **Summary:** Provide a concise summary between <SUMMARY> tags. Describe the model's core idea (utility is a scaled gain term multiplied by a penalty factor based on unfairness). Crucially, explain *how* this specific multiplicative structure, where `beta_value` scales the gain (numerator) and `beta_unfairness` affects the penalty factor's denominator, is specifically intended to improve robust parameter identifiability for *both* parameters by creating mathematically distinct and separable influence profiles compared to previous models.\n*   **Think Outside the Box:** Parameter identifiability for *both* parameters simultaneously remains the persistent, difficult challenge. While Run 84's structure showed the most promise so far, it still didn't reach the 0.7 recovery threshold for both. This re-attempt aims to confirm and hopefully improve upon that. If this specific multiplicative structure *still* fails to achieve >= 0.7 recovery for *both* parameters in Run 86, the next iteration *must* consider even more fundamentally different structural approaches that move beyond standard gain/loss formulations. Think about models where parameters might influence decision noise, contribute additively in log-space, define aspiration levels, or influence the choice process in a more qualitative way than just scaling utility components. Focus intently on finding a functional form where varying `beta_value` has a clearly distinguishable effect on the utility curve across offers compared to varying `beta_unfairness`, allowing them to be estimated independently with high reliability. This is a prerequisite for better fit metrics and meaningful interpretation.\n\nAvailable Data Variables:\n- trial_type, trial_role, token_opp, token_self, combined_earning, split_opp, split_self, splitperc_opp, split_perc_self, accept, accepted_amount, accepted_perc, proposed_perc, proposed_amount.\n(Note: Use `split_perc_self` for the participant's proposed percentage share percentage).\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions. Remember that robust parameter identifiability for *both* learnable parameters (>= 0.7 recovery for both) is the absolute priority. Your goal is to find a structure where both parameters' influences are clearly distinguishable and interact in a way that allows for reliable estimation for *both* parameters, ideally leading to improved fit metrics (BIC and accuracy) as a result of capturing the underlying process more accurately.\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions.\n\nPrevious Models:Not Provided\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions.",

The utility of accepting is calculated as a multiplicative combination of the proposed percentage share and a penalty factor based on perceived unfairness. The perceived unfairness is the degree to which the proposed share falls below a calculated fair share based on token contributions. The model uses two learnable parameters: 'beta_value' which scales the proposed share (gain term), and 'beta_unfairness' which scales the unfairness term within the denominator of the penalty factor. This multiplicative structure is specifically intended to improve robust parameter identifiability by giving the parameters mathematically separable influences on the utility function.\nTarget Variable: accept\nPrediction Type: utility\nBIC: 41.8789423164295\nOverall Accuracy: 0.6667\nGroup Accuracies:\n- Control: 0.7306\n- Cocaine: 0.6094\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- beta_value: r = 0.453\n- beta_unfairness: r = 0.333"
