Okay, here are the improved instructions for the next run (Run 92 of 100).

Task Description: In this ultimatum game experiment, the participant acts as both a proposer and a responsder. They are the proposer 14 times and the responsder 36 times. Each is designated by a trial number in the data set. There is also a pretask where the participant finds a number of tokens that correspond to their contribution to the group. This is designated by the variable "token_self". The other variable, "token_opp", is the number of tokens found the opponent's and represents the opoonents contribution to the shared pot that will be later divided by the opponent. The rounds are a mixed, with the participant doing a handful of turns as a responder, then a handful as a proposer, and then a handful as a responder, and so on.

Again, the participant gets to act as both a proposer and responder - this is reflected in the data. If you are guessing the proposed amount, you should only be making this guess when trial_role == 2, since this is when the data within the proposed_perc and proposed_amount columns are relevent.

Note that in each trial there is a variable amount of money in the combined earning, so that two equal split_self variables do not represent the same "fairness".

Below is the description of each variable in the dataset:

trial_type = how much was the contribution [1 = equal, 2 = opponent more, 3 = participant more]
trial_role = the role of the participant [1 = responder, 2 = proposer]
token_opp = number of tokens found by the opponent
token_self = number of tokens found by the participant
combined_earning = amount of money earned in total (note that each token found is £3)
split_opp = the proposed share of the opponent (in £)
split_self = the proposed share for the participant (in £)
splitperc_opp = same but in %
split_perc_self = same but in %
accept = whether the participant responded accept (1) or reject (0)
accepted_amount = if accepted, what is the amount gain (in £)
accepted_perc = same as above but in %
proposed_perc = when participant is the proposer, what is the % proposed to the opponent
proposed_amount = when participant is the proposer, what is the amount proposed to the opponent (in £)

Desired Output Specification: Design a computational model for the described task. Your model should utilyze the given variables appropriately (but not necessarily all unless otherwise specified).

The model should:
1. Predict only responder behavior (should target "accept = whether the participant responded accept (1) or reject (0)")
2. You will have to pass parameter recovery tests. This should be roughly equal in priority to accuracy.
3. Be applicable to the dataset given within the task description (i.e. the model should be able to be run using only the provided dataset structure).
4. Predict utility, where less than 0 is less than 50% likely.

For any learnable parameters in your model, you must specify finite numerical bounds (it just can not be infinity) in the variable descriptions. However, this bound should be generous. The utility variable may be unbounded (-inf to inf).

Then, provide your formal mathematical model between <MODEL> tags, followed by variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> tags. Additionally, specify the target variable that your model will predict. This should be one of the variables from the dataset above. Enclose it in <target_variable> tags.
For example: <target_variable>accept</target_variable> if your model is predicting whether a participant accepts or rejects a proposal.

Use clear mathematical notation and ensure each variable is fully described. Every variable must be utilized within the mathematical formula provided between <MODEL> and </MODEL>, and only strictly the mathematical formula should be provided between these tags with no filler words or descriptions. For variable descriptions, provide them in a JSON format with the following structure: <VARIABLES> Bounds are by default inclusive. Please spell out the greek variable names instead of using the symbols. Finally, you should provide a short description of the model in the summary tags <SUMMARY> </SUMMARY>. This will be used to compare different computational models of the task; it should be concise and purely descriptive. Do not include generic information about the name of the tasks, since that is implied.

<SUMMARY>
A linear utility model combining base preference, environmental influence, and stochastic noise. The model uses two learnable parameters: a base tendency parameter (β) constrained to [0,1] and an unconstrained environmental sensitivity parameter (ε). Environmental cues and normally distributed noise modify the base utility, allowing for both systematic and random variation in choice behavior.
</SUMMARY>
</EXAMPLE>

Please be sure to provide the mathematical formula for the model between <MODEL> and </MODEL>, and the variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES>. No description of the model should be provided within the <MODEL> tags.

The variable names you choose in your <VARIABLES> section must be used exactly as specified in the <MODEL> formula. Please ensure these names can be used directly in Python code (e.g., avoid Python reserved words). Also, ensure consistency between the variable names in your JSON and the variable names in the provided data description where applicable (e.g., use `split_perc_self` exactly as provided).

Model Type:
Your model should predict the utility of a binary choice. The utility will be converted to a probability using a logistic function with temperature 1, and then used to predict binary decisions.

Instructions: Okay, here are the improved instructions for the next run (Run 92 of 100).

The previous attempt using the multiplicative interaction structure (`U_accept = split_perc_self * (beta_gain - beta_unfairness * loss_below_fair)`) resulted in critically poor parameter recovery (`beta_gain`: -0.036, `beta_unfairness`: 0.281) and a high BIC (592.11), indicating this specific structure failed to create sufficiently distinct influence profiles for the parameters or introduced numerical instability. Robust parameter identifiability (recovery >= 0.7 for *all* learnable parameters simultaneously) remains the **unwavering primary objective**. We must find a model structure where the influence of the two learnable parameters is genuinely separable and reliably estimable.

Given the ongoing challenges, we need to continue exploring different structural principles. The failure of the previous multiplicative structure suggests that combining the 'gain' and 'penalty' influences within a single multiplicative factor tied to `split_perc_self` might be the core problem, leading to non-identifiability.

Let's return to the principle that utility is influenced by the offer itself (`split_perc_self`) and a penalty when the offer is unfair (`loss_below_fair > 0`), but structure these influences **additively** again, while introducing a **gentle non-linearity** to the penalty term to potentially improve identifiability compared to purely linear additive models.

Here are the standard calculation steps for necessary intermediate variables. You *must* include these first before defining `U_accept`:
1.  Calculate `sum_tokens = token_self + token_opp`.
2.  Calculate `fair_perc_self_calc` handling the `sum_tokens == 0` case (defaulting to 50.0), using `token_self` and `token_opp` from the data. Use `IF` for the conditional calculation.
3.  Calculate `loss_below_fair = Max(0.0, fair_perc_self_calc - split_perc_self)`. This term is positive if the offer is below the fair share, and 0 otherwise. Use `Max` for this calculation.

Now, design a novel formula for `U_accept` using `split_perc_self`, `loss_below_fair`, and exactly two learnable parameters. The formula for `U_accept` must implement the principle of utility being an additive combination of:
1.  A term linear in `split_perc_self`, scaled by the first learnable parameter.
2.  A penalty term, scaled by the second learnable parameter, that is based on `loss_below_fair` but uses a gentle non-linear transformation (like `log(1.0 + loss_below_fair)`) and is only active when `loss_below_fair > 0`.

A suggested specific structure to explore that follows this principle is:
`U_accept = beta_value * split_perc_self - beta_penalty * log(1.0 + loss_below_fair)`
This structure represents utility as a base sensitivity to the proposed percentage (`beta_value`) combined additively with a penalty that is triggered by unfairness (`loss_below_fair > 0`) and scaled by `beta_penalty`. The use of the `log(1.0 + loss_below_fair)` transformation is a gentle non-linearity intended to capture diminishing sensitivity to increasing unfairness and differentiate the penalty's influence from the linear `split_perc_self` term, thereby improving identifiability.

*   **Key Inputs & Calculated Variables:** Use `split_perc_self`, `token_self`, `token_opp` as data variables. Calculate `sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc` (handling `sum_tokens == 0`), `loss_below_fair`, and `U_accept`. Include calculation steps for derived variables *before* the formula for `U_accept`.
*   **Learnable Parameters:** Exactly **2 learnable parameters**. Choose descriptive, Python-safe names (e.g., `beta_value`, `beta_penalty`). Define clear, generous, finite numerical bounds.
    *   Parameter 1 (e.g., `beta_value`): Should represent the linear sensitivity to the proposed percentage (`split_perc_self`). Non-negative bounds, e.g., `[0.0, 10.0]`.
    *   Parameter 2 (e.g., `beta_penalty`): Should scale the non-linear penalty term based on `loss_below_fair`. Non-negative bounds, e.g., `[0.0, 10.0]`.
*   **Calculated Variables:** Include descriptions for *all* calculated variables used in the model (including `U_accept`, `sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc`, and `loss_below_fair`) with `source: "calculated"`. Include descriptions for all data variables used as inputs (`token_self`, `token_opp`, `split_perc_self`) with `source: "data"`.
*   **Variable Descriptions:** Provide variable descriptions in JSON format between <VARIABLES> tags for *all* variables in the <MODEL> formula. Include source, range (with inclusive flags), distribution (if applicable), and learnable status. Remember variable names must exactly match the model formula and data descriptions.
*   **Target Variable:** Specify "accept" using <target_variable> tags.
*   **Summary:** Provide a concise summary between <SUMMARY> tags. Describe the model's core idea (utility is an additive combination of a linear gain from the proposed percentage and a non-linear penalty for unfair offers). **Crucially, explain *how* this specific, additive structure with a linear term for `split_perc_self` and a log-transformed penalty term for `loss_below_fair` is designed to create mathematically distinct and separable influence profiles for the two learnable parameters.** Highlight that `beta_value` influences utility linearly based on `split_perc_self` across all trials, while `beta_penalty` *only* influences the utility calculation on unfair trials (where `loss_below_fair > 0`) through a different functional form (`log(1.0 + loss_below_fair)`), and how this separation and difference in functional form is intended to improve robust joint parameter identifiability compared to previous attempts (especially the failed multiplicative structure and the linear-additive structure).

Available Data Variables:
- trial_type, trial_role, token_opp, token_self, combined_earning, split_opp, split_self, splitperc_opp, split_perc_self, accept, accepted_amount, accepted_perc, proposed_perc, proposed_amount.
(Note: Use `split_perc_self` for the participant's proposed percentage share).

Please think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions. Remember that robust parameter identifiability for *both* learnable parameters (>= 0.7 recovery for both) is the absolute priority. Your goal is to find a structure where both parameters' influences are clearly distinguishable and interact in a way that allows for reliable estimation for *both* parameters, ideally leading to improved fit metrics (BIC and accuracy) as a result of capturing the underlying process more accurately. Avoid structures that have failed recovery previously. Explore this specific additive structure combining linear gain and log-transformed penalty as detailed above, focusing on how this structural separation and difference in functional form creates distinct influence profiles for the two betas.
