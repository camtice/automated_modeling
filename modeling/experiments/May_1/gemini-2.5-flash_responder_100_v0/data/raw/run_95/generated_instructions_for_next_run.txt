Okay, here are the improved instructions for the next run (Run 96 of 100).

Task Description: In this ultimatum game experiment, the participant acts as both a proposer and a responsder. They are the proposer 14 times and the responsder 36 times. Each is designated by a trial number in the data set. There is also a pretask where the participant finds a number of tokens that correspond to their contribution to the group. This is designated by the variable "token_self". The other variable, "token_opp", is the number of tokens found the opponent's and represents the opoonents contribution to the shared pot that will be later divided by the opponent. The rounds are a mixed, with the participant doing a handful of turns as a responder, then a handful as a proposer, and then a handful as a responder, and so on.

Again, the participant gets to act as both a proposer and responder - this is reflected in the data. If you are guessing the proposed amount, you should only be making this guess when trial_role == 2, since this is when the data within the proposed_perc and proposed_amount columns are relevent.

Note that in each trial there is a variable amount of money in the combined earning, so that two equal split_self variables do not represent the same "fairness".

Below is the description of each variable in the dataset:

trial_type = how much was the contribution [1 = equal, 2 = opponent more, 3 = participant more]
trial_role = the role of the participant [1 = responder, 2 = proposer]
token_opp = number of tokens found by the opponent
token_self = number of tokens found by the participant
combined_earning = amount of money earned in total (note that each token found is £3)
split_opp = the proposed share of the opponent (in £)
split_self = the proposed share for the participant (in £)
splitperc_opp = same but in %
split_perc_self = same but in %
accept = whether the participant responded accept (1) or reject (0)
accepted_amount = if accepted, what is the amount gain (in £)
accepted_perc = same as above but in %
proposed_perc = when participant is the proposer, what is the % proposed to the opponent
proposed_amount = when participant is the proposer, what is the amount proposed to the opponent (in £)

Desired Output Specification: Design a computational model for the described task. Your model should utilyze the given variables appropriately (but not necessarily all unless otherwise specified).

The model should:
1. Predict only responder behavior (should target "accept = whether the participant responded accept (1) or reject (0)")
2. You will have to pass parameter recovery tests. This should be roughly equal in priority to accuracy. Specifically, *all* learnable parameters must have a parameter recovery value of >= 0.7.
3. Be applicable to the dataset given within the task description (i.e. the model should be able to be run using only the provided dataset structure).
4. Predict utility, where less than 0 is less than 50% likely.

For any learnable parameters in your model, you must specify finite numerical bounds (it just can not be infinity) in the variable descriptions. However, this bound should be generous. The utility variable may be unbounded (-inf to inf).

Then, provide your formal mathematical model between <MODEL> tags, followed by variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> tags. Additionally, specify the target variable that your model will predict. This should be one of the variables from the dataset above. Enclose it in <target_variable> tags.
For example: <target_variable>accept</target_variable> if your model is predicting whether a participant accepts or rejects a proposal.

Use clear mathematical notation and ensure each variable is fully described. Every variable must be utilized within the mathematical formula provided between <MODEL> and </MODEL>, and only strictly the mathematical formula should be provided between these tags with no filler words or descriptions. For variable descriptions, provide them in a JSON format with the following structure: <VARIABLES> Bounds are by default inclusive. Please spell out the greek variable names instead of using the symbols. Finally, you should provide a short description of the model in the summary tags <SUMMARY> </SUMMARY>. This will be used to compare different computational models of the task; it should be concise and purely descriptive. Do not include generic information about the name of the tasks, since that is implied.

<SUMMARY>
A linear utility model combining base preference, environmental influence, and stochastic noise. The model uses two learnable parameters: a base tendency parameter (β) constrained to [0,1] and an unconstrained environmental sensitivity parameter (ε). Environmental cues and normally distributed noise modify the base utility, allowing for both systematic and random variation in choice behavior.

Please be sure to provide the mathematical formula for the model between <MODEL> and </MODEL>, and the variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES>. No description of the model should be provided within the <MODEL> tags.

The variable names you choose in your <VARIABLES> section must be used exactly as specified in the <MODEL> formula. Please ensure these names can be used directly in Python code (e.g., avoid Python reserved words). Also, ensure consistency between the variable names in your JSON and the variable names in the provided data description where applicable (e.g., use `split_perc_self` exactly as provided).

Model Type:
Your model should predict the utility of a binary choice. The utility will be converted to a probability using a logistic function with temperature 1, and then used to predict binary decisions.

Instructions: Okay, here are the improved instructions for the next run (Run 96 of 100).

The previous model, which attempted to scale the absolute offer percentage and the fairness deviation percentage independently, did not achieve robust parameter recovery (recovery < 0.7 for both parameters). This suggests that scaling these two particular inputs with two separate linear parameters resulted in influences on utility that were too mathematically similar or inputs too correlated across trials for the parameters to be reliably estimated.

In contrast, a simpler linear model combining the fairness deviation with a constant intercept *did* achieve robust parameter recovery (> 0.7 for both parameters: slope on deviation, and intercept). This indicates the success of a structural separation where one parameter scales a variable input (the "slope") and the other provides an independent offset (the "intercept").

Robust parameter identifiability remains the **unwavering primary objective** (recovery >= 0.7 for *all* learnable parameters). We must build on the structural principles that worked for identifiability, which seems to be having two parameters with fundamentally distinct types of influence on the utility calculation, rather than simply scaling different but potentially correlated continuous inputs.

You *must* include these standard calculation steps first before defining `U_accept`:\n
1.  Calculate `sum_tokens = token_self + token_opp`.\n
2.  Calculate `fair_perc_self_calc` handling the `sum_tokens == 0` case (defaulting to 50.0), using `token_self` and `token_opp` from the data. Use `IF` for the conditional calculation.\n

Now, design a **novel** formula for `U_accept` incorporating exactly **two learnable parameters**. Focus intently on creating a structure where these two parameters have demonstrably *different types* of mathematical influence on the utility calculation to ensure robust identifiability.

Specifically, design the model such that:
*   One parameter acts like a "slope", scaling a continuous variable input that changes on each trial (e.g., `split_perc_self`, `split_perc_self - fair_perc_self_calc`).
*   The second parameter acts like an "intercept" or a "bias", providing a constant offset, or scaling a categorical/binary state variable (e.g., scaling 1 as an intercept, or scaling a calculated variable like `is_unfair = IF(split_perc_self < fair_perc_self_calc, 1, 0)`).

Avoid structures where both parameters scale continuous variables that are highly correlated linear transformations of each other (like scaling `split_perc_self` and `fair_perc_self_calc` or their difference simultaneously, as this failed recovery).

Think creatively about how the second parameter can capture a distinct psychological process (like a general bias, an aversion specific to unfair offers, or an effect tied to the contribution structure) by scaling a variable that behaves fundamentally differently across trials than the continuous variable scaled by the first parameter.

Use `split_perc_self`, `token_self`, `token_opp` as data variables, plus potentially *other relevant data variables* from the list provided (`trial_type`, `combined_earning`, etc.) or calculated variables derived from them (like `is_unfair`).

*   **Key Inputs & Calculated Variables:** Use `split_perc_self`, `token_self`, `token_opp` as data variables, plus potentially others from the provided list. Calculate `sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc`, and `U_accept`. Include calculation steps for derived variables *before* the formula for `U_accept`. Include function definitions like `IF` if used.
*   **Learnable Parameters:** Exactly **2 learnable parameters**. Choose descriptive, Python-safe names. Define clear, generous, finite numerical bounds. Ensure the parameters' roles are structurally distinct to promote identifiability (e.g., one scaling a continuous variable, the other a constant or binary state).
*   **Calculated Variables:** Include descriptions for *all* calculated variables used in the model (including `U_accept`, `sum_tokens`, `fair_perc_self_calc`, any derived binary variables, and any functions like `IF`) with `source: "calculated"`. Include descriptions for all data variables used as inputs with `source: "data"` that appear in your <MODEL>.
*   **Variable Descriptions:** Provide variable descriptions in JSON format between <VARIABLES> tags for *all* variables used in the <MODEL> formula. Include source, range (with inclusive flags), distribution (if applicable), and learnable status. Remember variable names must exactly match the model formula and data descriptions.
*   **Target Variable:** Specify "accept" using <target_variable> tags.
*   **Summary:** Provide a concise summary between <SUMMARY> tags. Describe the model's core idea. **Crucially, explain *how* the specific structure of your model ensures robust parameter identifiability for *both* learnable parameters (recovery >= 0.7). Clearly articulate the distinct mathematical/psychological roles of the two parameters and why their influences are expected to be separable by the fitting process, building on the lessons learned from the success of the deviation + intercept model and the failure of the previous model.**

Available Data Variables:
- trial_type, trial_role, token_opp, token_self, combined_earning, split_opp, split_self, splitperc_opp, split_perc_self, accept, accepted_amount, accepted_perc, proposed_perc, proposed_amount.
(Note: Use `split_perc_self` for the participant's proposed percentage share).

Please think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions. Remember that robust parameter identifiability for *both* learnable parameters (>= 0.7 recovery for both) is the absolute priority. Your goal is to find a novel structure with *exactly two* parameters where their influences are clearly distinguishable (e.g., one scaling a continuous variable, the other providing a constant or binary bias) and interact in a way that allows for reliable estimation, ideally leading to improved fit metrics (BIC and accuracy) compared to the best previous run. Avoid structures that have failed recovery previously by ensuring the two parameters have fundamentally different mathematical roles that are likely to be identifiable. Be creative and think "out of the box" about how to use the available data variables and exactly two parameters to capture distinct aspects of the responder's decision process while maintaining identifiability.
