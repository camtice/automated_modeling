p_accept = 1/(1+exp(-U))",A logistic decision model where the utility is a linear function of the fairness error calculated as the difference between the offered share (split_self) and the participantâ€™s fair share (computed from tokens and combined earnings). Utility is determined by a baseline bias (beta0) and a fairness sensitivity weight (beta1). This utility is mapped to a probability of acceptance using a logistic function.,v0,0.8545728099535779,0.7310345451338903
