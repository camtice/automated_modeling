1,40.72841484070661,,,P(accept=1) = 1/(1+exp(-(alpha + beta*(split_self - ((token_self/(token_self+token_opp))*combined_earning))))),"A logistic choice model where the utility of accepting is a linear function of the fairness difference between the offered share and the participant's fair share (computed from their token contribution relative to the total tokens and multiplied by the combined earning). Two learnable parameters (a baseline bias, alpha, and fairness sensitivity, beta) determine the mapping from fairness evaluation to choice probability.",v1,0.8568274069881103,0.49980655827424647
