1,41.03275999652184,,,logit(P(accept=1)) = beta0 + beta_f * (split_self - (combined_earning * (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)))),A fairness-based logistic choice model that computes the utility as a linear combination of a baseline bias and a fairness sensitivity component. The fairness deviation is measured as the difference between the actual offer and the fair share (computed from token contributions and combined earnings). The resulting utility is transformed via the logistic function to predict the binary accept decision.,v2,0.8631425340809632,0.5238072778477971
