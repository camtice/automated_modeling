accept ~ Bernoulli(p)",A binary choice model for responder behavior where the utility U is computed as a linear combination of a baseline bias (alpha) and a scaled fairness deviation (beta) between the offered share (split_self) and the expected fair share based on the participant's token contribution relative to the total tokens. The utility is then passed through a logistic function to produce a probability for acceptance.,v4
