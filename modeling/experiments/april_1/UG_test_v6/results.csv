accept ~ Bernoulli(p_accept)",A model in which the utility of accepting a proposal is computed as a linear function of the deviation between the offered share (split_self) and the fair share based on pretask tokens. Two learnable parameters – a bias (beta_bias) and a fairness sensitivity (beta_fair) – determine how this deviation influences utility. The utility is then transformed via a logistic function to yield the probability of acceptance.,v6,0.8868037351313035,0.8125772490622545
