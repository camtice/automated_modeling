1,42.34099263303511,,,P_accept = 1/(1+exp(-(beta_zero + beta_one*(split_self - (token_self/(token_self+token_opp))*combined_earning)))),A logistic utility model for responder decisions where utility is computed as a baseline bias (beta_zero) plus a sensitivity-weighted fairness deviation. The fairness deviation is defined as the difference between the actual monetary share offered (split_self) and the participantâ€™s fair share based on their token contribution relative to the total tokens multiplied by the combined earnings. The resulting utility is transformed via a logistic function to yield the probability of accepting the proposal.,v8,0.8736873730963032,0.7322145313759931
