The utility combines a linear term for the offered percentage (beta) and a penalty term for offers below the fair share (alpha). The fair share is computed as the participant's token contribution proportion scaled to a percentage. Logistic transformation converts utility to acceptance probability.,v0,"Be VERY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters as the model.
