Refine the model to improve accuracy, parameter recovery, and BIC.  The previous model showed poor recovery for parameters w1-w5. Consider alternative formulations to reduce parameter covariance.  Explore non-linear relationships between variables. Don't just focus on simple linear combinations; think about interactions and potentially more complex functions.   Consider including interaction terms between variables, such as the interaction between relative gain and relative contribution.  Explore transformations of the input variables (e.g., logarithmic, square root).  Explore models beyond logistic regression. Consider incorporating regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.  Aim for a model with a parsimonious number of parameters while maintaining high accuracy and good parameter recovery.
