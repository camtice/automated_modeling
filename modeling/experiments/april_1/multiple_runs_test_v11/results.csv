Refine the model to improve accuracy, parameter recovery, and reduce the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The previous model exhibited poor parameter recovery, indicating potential issues with multicollinearity or model misspecification.  

Specifically address the following:

1. **Multicollinearity:** Explore methods to reduce multicollinearity amongst predictor variables.  Consider principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data or use regularization techniques (e.g., LASSO or Ridge regression) to shrink coefficients and improve model stability.

2. **Model Specification:**  The previous model relied heavily on linear combinations and interactions of relatively similar variables. Experiment with fundamentally different model structures beyond logistic regression.  Consider generalized additive models (GAMs) to allow for non-linear relationships without explicitly specifying functional forms. Explore Bayesian models which offer a natural way to incorporate prior knowledge and quantify uncertainty.

3. **Variable Transformations and Handling:**  The ratios (e.g., `token_self / (token_self + token_opp)`) are prone to division-by-zero errors and may be numerically unstable. Consider alternative formulations, such as using robust versions of these ratios, or incorporating a small constant to the denominator to avoid division by zero.  Additionally, explore different transformations of the input variables (e.g., Box-Cox transformation) to improve model fit.

4. **Overfitting:** Implement regularization techniques (LASSO, Ridge, Elastic Net) to address potential overfitting, particularly given the number of parameters in the previous models.  Cross-validation should be used to tune the regularization parameter.

5. **Out-of-the-box thinking:** Don't limit yourself to simple modifications of the previous model.  Consider entirely different approaches to model the decision-making process, perhaps incorporating reinforcement learning concepts, or exploring agent-based modeling where the decision-making agents interact with each other and the environment.


Aim for a model with a significantly lower BIC, improved parameter recovery (particularly for parameters analogous to w1-w5 in the previous model), and higher accuracy.  A concise summary of the model's structure and rationale should be provided.",,,,,,
