Okay, let's look at the previous model's results. The BIC was around 124.65, which is okay, but there's room for improvement. The accuracy was 84.8%, which is decent, but parameter recovery for theta was lower (0.766) compared to beta (0.890). That suggests that theta might not be as well-identified in the model. Maybe the model needs more features or a different structure to better capture the underlying mechanisms.

The previous model used a utility function with beta (baseline) and theta (penalty for unfairness). The penalty was based on the difference between 3*token_self and split_self. But maybe there's more to fairness. For example, participants might also care about the opponent's share relative to their contribution. Or maybe the penalty should be nonlinear, like a quadratic term when the offer is very unfair.

Another thought: the current model uses max(3*token_self - split_self, 0), which only penalizes when the offer is below the fair share. But perhaps participants also have a sensitivity to advantageous inequity, where they get more than their fair share. Although, in the responder role, they might not reject such offers, but including that could help in parameter recovery if some participants are sensitive to overcompensation.

Alternatively, the model could include a term for the ratio of split_self to the fair share instead of the absolute difference. For example, (split_self / (3*token_self)) - 1. This might capture proportional deviations, which could be more psychologically relevant.

Also, the current model has two parameters. Maybe adding a third parameter, like a sensitivity to the opponent's overcompensation, but that could increase covariance. Alternatively, using a nonlinear transformation of the existing terms, like a sigmoid for the penalty, might help without adding parameters.

The parameter recovery for theta was lower, so perhaps the model needs to better differentiate the effects of theta. Maybe introducing an interaction term between split_self and the fairness penalty. Or scaling the penalty by some other variable, like the total combined earnings.

Another angle: the baseline beta might not account for individual differences in response bias. Maybe including a trial-level random effect or a hierarchical structure, but that's complex. Alternatively, adding another fixed effect, like trial_type (whether contributions are equal, opponent more, etc.), could capture context effects.

Wait, the trial_type variable indicates if contributions were equal, opponent more, or participant more. Including trial_type in the model might help. For example, participants might be more sensitive to unfairness when they contributed more (trial_type=3). So an interaction between trial_type and the fairness penalty could improve the model.

But the instructions say to use the variables appropriately but not necessarily all. So maybe trial_type can be a moderator for theta. For example, theta could vary based on trial_type, allowing different sensitivity in different contexts. That would add parameters, but maybe improve recovery.

Alternatively, the model could use the difference between split_self and split_opp, but given that split_opp is determined once split_self is set, that might not add new info. But if participants compare their split to the opponent's, that could be a factor. However, split_opp is the opponent's proposed share, which might not be directly comparable.

Another idea: the model could consider the proportion of the total combined earnings that split_self represents. For example, split_perc_self. But the current model uses absolute amounts. Maybe participants think in percentages rather than absolute values. So the utility could be based on split_perc_self compared to the fair percentage (token_self / (token_self + token_opp) * 100). But that's similar to the current approach, just in percentage terms.

Wait, the current model uses 3*token_self as the fair share, which is equivalent to (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning, since combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So the model already captures the fair share proportionally. But maybe participants have nonlinear utility for money, so log(split_self) instead of split_self. That could be tested.

Alternatively, the model could include a term for the magnitude of the combined earnings. For example, higher combined earnings might make participants more or less sensitive to unfairness. But that would require an interaction term between combined_earning and the fairness penalty, adding another parameter.

In summary, possible improvements:

1. Introduce nonlinear terms for the fairness penalty (e.g., squared term).
2. Include trial_type as a moderator for theta.
3. Use percentage-based fairness instead of absolute.
4. Consider advantageous inequity (overcompensation) with a separate parameter.
5. Add a parameter for the curvature of the utility function (e.g., log utility).

But to keep the number of parameters low, maybe try a nonlinear penalty. For example, theta * (max(3*token_self - split_self, 0))^2. This would make the penalty increase quadratically with the deficit, which might better capture strong aversion to large unfairness.

Alternatively, use a sigmoid function to cap the penalty, but that's more complex. A quadratic term adds one parameter (the exponent), but if we fix it to 2, no new parameters. However, the current model uses a linear penalty. A quadratic term might improve fit without adding parameters if the exponent is fixed.

Another approach: allow theta to vary with token_self. For example, participants with higher token_self (more contribution) might be more sensitive to unfairness. But that would require an interaction term, adding a parameter.

Alternatively, the model could include a dynamic baseline where beta is influenced by token_self or other variables. But that complicates the model.

Given the previous results, the main issue is theta's lower recovery. To address this, the model needs to better isolate the effect of theta. Perhaps by making the penalty term more distinct or adding another feature that theta interacts with, allowing better estimation.

In the new instructions, I should encourage exploring different functional forms for the fairness component, considering both under and over-compensation, and possibly interactions with trial context (trial_type). Also, suggest testing nonlinear transformations of the fairness term to improve parameter identifiability.

**Revised Instructions for Next Run:**

1. **Expand Fairness Sensitivity:** Explore nonlinear transformations of the fairness penalty (e.g., quadratic terms, sigmoidal scaling) to better capture aversion thresholds. Consider asymmetric penalties for small vs. large deficits.

2. **Contextual Modulation:** Investigate interactions between fairness sensitivity (theta) and trial context (e.g., `trial_type` where contributions are unequal). Allow parameters to adapt based on whether the participant contributed more/less than the opponent.

3. **Relative Value Encoding:** Test utility formulations that compare the offer to both parties' contributions (e.g., ratio of `split_self` to opponent's `split_opp` normalized by contributions) rather than absolute fairness.

4. **Dynamic Baseline:** Allow baseline acceptance tendency (beta) to vary with contextual factors like total combined earnings or contribution magnitude to capture scale-dependent risk attitudes.

5. **Parameter Identifiability:** Prioritize models where parameters have distinct mechanistic roles (e.g., separate terms for monetary utility vs. social comparisons) to reduce covariance. Consider piecewise functions for different fairness regimes.

6. **Alternative Utility Forms:** Experiment with prospect theory elements (e.g., reference-dependent utility where 3*token_self acts as a reference point) or loss aversion framing.

**Key Focus:** Break the linear penalty paradigm while maintaining â‰¤3 parameters. Target theta recovery improvement through clearer separation from baseline tendencies.
