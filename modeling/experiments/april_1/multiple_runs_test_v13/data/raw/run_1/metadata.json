      "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts whether a participant (acting as the responder) accepts or rejects a proposal in the given experiment. The model needs to focus on responder behavior, use the provided variables appropriately, and have parameters that can be recovered through parameter estimation. Also, the utility function should be such that a negative utility corresponds to less than 50% probability of acceptance, which suggests using a logistic function where the probability is 1/(1 + exp(-utility)).\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key variables that influence the responder's decision. From the dataset, the variables related to the responder's decision when they are in the responder role (trial_role=1) include:\n\n- token_self: the participant's own contribution (tokens found)\n- token_opp: the opponent's contribution\n- split_self: the proposed share for the participant in \u00a3\n- split_opp: the proposed share for the opponent in \u00a3\n- combined_earning: total money earned (each token is \u00a33, so combined_earning = 3*(token_self + token_opp))\n- trial_type: whether contributions are equal, opponent more, or participant more\n\nThe responder's decision (accept or reject) likely depends on how fair they perceive the split to be, considering both their own contribution and the opponent's. Fairness here could be a comparison between the proposed split and what would be considered equitable based on contributions.\n\nSo, the utility function should incorporate some measure of fairness. One common approach is to model inequity aversion, where individuals prefer equitable outcomes and experience disutility from unequal distributions. Fehr and Schmidt's model of inequity aversion is a classic example here. However, since the contributions (tokens) are part of the task, the model should account for the participants' own contribution and the opponent's contribution when evaluating fairness.\n\nLet me think about how to model the utility. The utility (U) could be a function of the monetary gain (split_self) minus some disutility from inequity. The inequity could be calculated as the difference between the proposed split and what would be a fair split based on contributions.\n\nThe fair split based on contributions would be proportional to each person's contribution. For example, the participant's fair share percentage would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The proposed percentage is splitperc_self. The difference between these could be a factor in the utility.\n\nAlternatively, the monetary amounts could be used. The fair amount would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. The proposed split_self minus this fair amount would be the inequity. If the proposed amount is less than the fair amount, the responder might feel disadvantaged, leading to a lower utility.\n\nBut maybe the model should consider both advantageous and disadvantageous inequity. However, since the responder is deciding to accept or reject, perhaps only disadvantageous inequity (when the responder gets less than their fair share) is relevant. Because if they get more than their fair share, they might still accept, but if they get less, they might reject.\n\nAlternatively, the model could have a parameter that captures sensitivity to any deviation from the fair split, regardless of direction. But given the task, perhaps the responder is more sensitive to being undercompensated relative to their contribution.\n\nAnother angle is to consider the ratio of the proposed split to the fair split. For example, if split_self is less than the fair amount, the ratio would be less than 1, which could be a negative term in the utility.\n\nLet me formalize this. The fair amount for the participant is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Let's call this fair_self. Then, the difference between split_self and fair_self is (split_self - fair_self). If this is positive, the responder is getting more than fair; if negative, less. The utility could be split_self (monetary gain) plus a term that penalizes deviations from fairness. But perhaps the disutility is only when split_self is less than fair_self. So, the disutility could be a parameter multiplied by max(fair_self - split_self, 0). Alternatively, the disutility could be proportional to the difference when split_self < fair_self.\n\nAlternatively, the model could use the ratio of split_self to fair_self. If split_self is less than fair_self, the ratio is less than 1, and the disutility is higher. For example, (fair_self - split_self)/fair_self could be a measure of the relative loss.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to model the utility as:\n\nUtility = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (split_self - fair_self)\n\nBut if split_self is less than fair_self, then (split_self - fair_self) is negative, which would reduce the utility. The parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 could represent the weight on the monetary gain and the weight on fairness, respectively. However, \u03b2 might be negative, so that when split_self is less than fair_self, the utility decreases.\n\nWait, but \u03b1 is the weight on the monetary amount. If \u03b1 is positive, higher split_self increases utility. The fairness term (split_self - fair_self) would be positive if the split is more than fair, negative otherwise. If \u03b2 is positive, then getting more than fair increases utility, which might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the fairness term should be (fair_self - split_self), so that when split_self is less than fair_self, this term is positive, leading to a decrease in utility if \u03b2 is negative. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nAlternatively, the model could have a parameter that captures the sensitivity to being below the fair share. For example:\n\nUtility = split_self + \u03b8 * max(fair_self - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b8 is a learnable parameter that represents the aversion to being undercompensated relative to their contribution. If \u03b8 is positive, then when split_self is less than fair_self, the utility decreases. If \u03b8 is negative, that would imply they prefer being undercompensated, which is unlikely. So \u03b8 should be positive. But in this case, \u03b8 is a penalty term for being underpaid.\n\nAlternatively, the model could use a nonlinear function, but given the need for parameter recovery and simplicity, a linear model might be better.\n\nAnother consideration is the total combined earning. Since each trial has a different combined_earning, the same split_self might represent different fairness levels. For example, if combined_earning is higher, a split_self of \u00a310 might be more or less fair depending on the contributions. So the model must account for the contributions (token_self and token_opp) to compute the fair share.\n\nSo, fair_self = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nBut combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so fair_self simplifies to 3*token_self. Because combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 3*(token_self + token_opp) = 3*token_self. Wait, that's a key insight! Because combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), the fair_self is exactly 3*token_self. Because each token is worth \u00a33. So the fair split for the participant is simply 3 times their own tokens. Similarly, the opponent's fair share is 3*token_opp. Therefore, the fair_self is 3*token_self, and the proposed split_self is the amount offered. So the difference between split_self and fair_self is (split_self - 3*token_self). If this is positive, the responder is getting more than their fair share; if negative, less.\n\nThis simplifies the model because we don't need to compute the ratio each time; fair_self is directly 3*token_self. Therefore, the difference (split_self - 3*token_self) can be used as a measure of inequity. If split_self is less than 3*token_self, the responder is getting less than their fair share, which might lead to rejection.\n\nSo the utility could be modeled as:\n\nUtility = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (split_self - 3*token_self)\n\nBut wait, split_self is part of the utility. Alternatively, the utility could be split_self (monetary gain) plus a term that captures the disutility from inequity. For example:\n\nUtility = split_self + \u03b8 * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b8 is a parameter that represents the sensitivity to being undercompensated. If \u03b8 is positive, then when split_self is less than 3*token_self, the utility decreases. This would make the responder more likely to reject the offer. If \u03b8 is zero, the responder only cares about the monetary gain. If \u03b8 is large and positive, even small under-compensations lead to a significant drop in utility.\n\nAlternatively, the model could use the difference (split_self - 3*token_self) directly. For example:\n\nUtility = split_self + \u03b3 * (split_self - 3*token_self)\n\nBut this would be equivalent to (1 + \u03b3) * split_self - 3*\u03b3 * token_self. Which might not capture the asymmetry between advantageous and disadvantageous inequity. However, since the responder is deciding to accept or reject, perhaps only disadvantageous inequity (split_self < fair_self) matters. Because if the split is more than fair, the responder would likely accept, so the disutility is only when split_self is less than fair_self.\n\nTherefore, using the max function to capture only the negative deviations makes sense. So:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b8 * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b8 is the penalty for being undercompensated. If split_self is less than 3*token_self, the max term is positive, so the utility decreases by \u03b8 times that amount. The higher \u03b8, the more the responder dislikes being undercompensated.\n\nAlternatively, the model could have a non-linear term, but for simplicity and to keep the number of parameters low, a linear term is better.\n\nAnother factor could be the opponent's proposed share. For example, if the opponent is taking a large share (split_opp), the responder might feel that's unfair. But since split_opp is the opponent's proposed share, and split_self is the responder's share, perhaps the model should focus on the responder's own share relative to their contribution.\n\nWait, but in the task description, when the participant is the responder, the split_self is the amount offered to them, and split_opp is the amount the opponent would take. However, combined_earning is split_self + split_opp. So the responder's share is split_self, and the opponent's is split_opp. The fair_self is 3*token_self, and the fair_opp is 3*token_opp. So the responder might compare their split_self to their fair_self, and the opponent's split_opp to their fair_opp. But since the responder's decision is to accept or reject, perhaps they are only concerned with their own share relative to their contribution. Alternatively, they might also consider the opponent's share relative to the opponent's contribution. For example, if the opponent is taking more than their fair share, that could also affect the responder's decision.\n\nBut including both terms might complicate the model. Let's think: if the responder's split_self is less than their fair_self, that's a reason to reject. If the opponent's split_opp is more than their fair_opp, that's another reason to reject. So the total inequity could be the sum of both under-compensation to self and over-compensation to the opponent.\n\nBut this would require two parameters: one for sensitivity to under-self and one for over-opponent. However, to keep the model simple and avoid high covariance between parameters, perhaps combining these into a single term.\n\nAlternatively, the model could consider the difference between the proposed split and the fair split for both parties. For example:\n\nUtility = split_self + \u03b8 * (split_self - 3*token_self) + \u03c6 * (split_opp - 3*token_opp)\n\nBut this introduces two parameters, \u03b8 and \u03c6. If \u03b8 and \u03c6 are both positive, then the responder is happy when they get more than their fair share and when the opponent gets more than their fair share, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if \u03b8 is positive (they like getting more than fair) and \u03c6 is negative (they dislike the opponent getting more than fair), but this complicates the model.\n\nAlternatively, the responder might be averse to both types of inequity: when they are under-compensated and when the opponent is over-compensated. So the total disutility could be the sum of (max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)) and (max(split_opp - 3*token_opp, 0)). Each multiplied by their respective parameters.\n\nSo:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b8_self * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0) - \u03b8_opp * max(split_opp - 3*token_opp, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b8_self is the sensitivity to being under-compensated, and \u03b8_opp is the sensitivity to the opponent being over-compensated. Both parameters would be positive, so higher values mean more aversion to each type of inequity.\n\nBut this introduces two parameters. However, the problem states that the model should have a slight bias towards fewer parameters. So maybe combining them into a single parameter. For example, assuming that the responder is equally sensitive to both types of inequity. Then:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b8 * [max(3*token_self - split_self, 0) + max(split_opp - 3*token_opp, 0)]\n\nBut this assumes that the disutility from under-self and over-opponent are weighted equally, which might not be the case. However, to reduce parameters, this could be a valid approach.\n\nAlternatively, given that split_opp is equal to combined_earning - split_self, and combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), then split_opp = 3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self. So the opponent's over-compensation would be split_opp - 3*token_opp = [3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self] - 3*token_opp = 3*token_self - split_self. Wait, that's interesting. So split_opp - 3*token_opp = 3*token_self - split_self. Therefore, the two terms max(3*token_self - split_self, 0) and max(split_opp - 3*token_opp, 0) are actually the same. Because if split_self < 3*token_self, then 3*token_self - split_self is positive, and split_opp = combined_earning - split_self = 3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self. So split_opp - 3*token_opp = 3*token_self - split_self. Therefore, the two terms are identical. So including both would be redundant. Therefore, the model can capture both types of inequity with a single term.\n\nThis is a crucial insight. Because split_opp - 3*token_opp equals 3*token_self - split_self. Therefore, the opponent's over-compensation is exactly equal to the responder's under-compensation. Therefore, the two terms are the same. So the model only needs to consider one of them. Hence, the disutility can be modeled as \u03b8 multiplied by max(3*token_self - split_self, 0), which captures both the responder's under-compensation and the opponent's over-compensation.\n\nTherefore, the utility function can be simplified to:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b8 * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nThis captures the idea that the responder's utility is their monetary gain minus a penalty proportional to how much they are under-compensated relative to their contribution (which also equals how much the opponent is over-compensated).\n\nNow, the probability of accepting is a logistic function of the utility. So:\n\nP(accept=1) = 1 / (1 + exp(-Utility))\n\nBut the problem states that the utility should be such that less than 0 utility corresponds to less than 50% probability. The logistic function meets this because when utility is negative, the probability is less than 0.5.\n\nNow, the model needs to have learnable parameters. In this case, \u03b8 is the learnable parameter. But perhaps there's another parameter to account for the scaling of the utility. For example, sometimes models include a temperature parameter (inverse of \u03b2 in logistic regression) that scales the utility before applying the logistic function. However, the problem states that the utility may be unbounded, but the parameters must have finite bounds. So perhaps the model should include a scaling parameter.\n\nWait, in logistic regression, the model is:\n\nP = 1 / (1 + exp(- (\u03b20 + \u03b21*x1 + ... )))\n\nHere, the coefficients \u03b2 are learnable. But in our case, the utility is already a linear combination, so perhaps we can model:\n\nUtility = \u03b1 * split_self - \u03b8 * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nBut then \u03b1 and \u03b8 are both learnable parameters. However, if \u03b1 is fixed to 1, then we have:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b8 * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nBut maybe \u03b1 should be a learnable parameter to account for the weight the participant places on the monetary gain. For example, some participants might value each pound more than others. However, if we fix \u03b1=1, then \u03b8 is the only learnable parameter. But perhaps allowing \u03b1 to vary could capture different sensitivities to money versus fairness. However, this introduces another parameter, which could lead to identifiability issues if \u03b1 and \u03b8 are correlated.\n\nAlternatively, since split_self is in pounds, and the model's utility is in a unit that maps to log-odds, perhaps scaling is necessary. For example, if \u03b8 is a scaling factor for the inequity term, but without a parameter for the monetary term, the model might not capture individual differences in how much they value money. However, given the instruction to have a slight bias towards fewer parameters, perhaps using a single parameter \u03b8 is better.\n\nWait, but in the example provided in the task, the model had two learnable parameters. The problem says to have an appropriate number, with a slight bias for fewer. So maybe one or two parameters.\n\nLet me think again. If we set \u03b1=1, then the utility is split_self (monetary gain) minus \u03b8 times the inequity. But perhaps participants have different baseline propensities to accept or reject, which could be captured by an intercept term. For example:\n\nUtility = \u03b1 * split_self - \u03b8 * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0) + \u03b2\n\nHere, \u03b2 is a bias term. If \u03b2 is positive, the participant has a higher baseline tendency to accept; if negative, a tendency to reject. However, adding \u03b2 introduces another parameter. But maybe this is necessary to account for individual differences in overall acceptance rates.\n\nBut the problem states that the model should predict utility where less than 0 corresponds to less than 50% probability. If we include a \u03b2 term, then even if split_self and the inequity term are zero, the utility is \u03b2. So if \u03b2 is negative, the baseline probability is less than 50%, which might be realistic. However, this adds another parameter. But perhaps it's necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intercept is not needed. For example, if when split_self is exactly equal to 3*token_self, the utility is split_self (which is 3*token_self). If the participant is indifferent at this point, the utility should be zero. Wait, no. If split_self is equal to 3*token_self, then the max term is zero, so utility is split_self. But split_self is 3*token_self, which is a positive value. So the utility would be positive, leading to a probability greater than 0.5. But in reality, when the split is exactly fair, the participant might be indifferent, so the utility should be zero. Therefore, perhaps the model should subtract the fair_self from the split_self. Wait, let's re-express:\n\nIf the fair_self is 3*token_self, then the utility could be:\n\nUtility = (split_self - 3*token_self) - \u03b8 * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nBut this simplifies to:\n\nIf split_self >= 3*token_self:\n\nUtility = (split_self - 3*token_self) - 0 = split_self - 3*token_self\n\nIf split_self < 3*token_self:\n\nUtility = (split_self - 3*token_self) - \u03b8*(3*token_self - split_self) = (split_self - 3*token_self) - \u03b8*(3*token_self - split_self) = (1 + \u03b8)*(split_self - 3*token_self)\n\nBut this seems more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the utility should be the difference between split_self and fair_self, minus a penalty when split_self is less than fair_self. Wait, that might not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the utility could be:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b8 * max(fair_self - split_self, 0)\n\nWhich is the same as before. But when split_self equals fair_self, the utility is split_self, which is 3*token_self. This would mean that even when the split is fair, the utility is positive, leading to a high probability of acceptance. Which is correct, as a fair split should be accepted. However, the model needs to have the utility threshold at zero. So when utility is positive, P>0.5; when negative, P<0.5. So in the case of a fair split, the utility is split_self (3*token_self), which is positive, leading to P>0.5. That makes sense.\n\nBut perhaps participants have different baseline sensitivities. For example, some might require more than the fair split to accept, others might accept even a bit less. To capture this, we could include an intercept term \u03b2, which shifts the utility:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b8 * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0) + \u03b2\n\nIn this case, \u03b2 could be negative, indicating a general tendency to reject, or positive, tendency to accept. However, this adds another parameter. But given that each participant has 36 trials, having two parameters (\u03b8 and \u03b2) per participant might be feasible. However, the problem states that the model should have learnable parameters with finite bounds. So perhaps \u03b8 and \u03b2 are both learnable, with \u03b2 bounded between, say, -10 and 10, and \u03b8 between 0 and 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intercept is not necessary. Let's think: when the split is exactly fair (split_self = 3*token_self), the utility is 3*token_self. If the participant's token_self varies across trials, then the utility at fair splits also varies. However, the probability of acceptance would depend on the utility, which is 3*token_self. For example, if token_self is 10, then utility is 30, leading to near-certain acceptance. But in reality, participants might accept fair splits almost always, so this might be acceptable. However, if the model doesn't have an intercept, it might not capture individual differences in baseline acceptance rates. For example, a participant who generally rejects offers (e.g., due to spite) would have a negative \u03b2, but without \u03b2, the model can't capture that.\n\nTherefore, including an intercept term \u03b2 might be necessary. So the utility becomes:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 + split_self - \u03b8 * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b2 is a learnable parameter representing the baseline tendency to accept (if positive) or reject (if negative). \u03b8 is the sensitivity to inequity (under-compensation). Both parameters need to be estimated.\n\nThis model has two learnable parameters: \u03b2 and \u03b8. The parameter \u03b2 can be bounded between, say, -10 and 10, and \u03b8 between 0 and 5 (since \u03b8 represents a penalty, it should be non-negative). The bounds should be generous but finite.\n\nNow, let's check if this model can be identified with the data. Each participant has 36 trials, which is sufficient to estimate two parameters. The parameter recovery would depend on the design of the trials, but given that the offers vary in split_self and token_self, it's plausible.\n\nAnother consideration is the scaling of the variables. split_self is in \u00a3, and token_self is in tokens (each worth \u00a33). The max term (3*token_self - split_self) is also in \u00a3. So \u03b8 is in units of \u00a3^{-1}? Wait, no. Let's see: \u03b8 is multiplied by a \u00a3 term, so \u03b8 has units of 1/\u00a3 to make the entire term unitless (since utility is in \u00a3). Wait, but utility is in \u00a3 terms. However, in the logistic function, the utility is used as a linear predictor, so the units are arbitrary. The parameters \u03b2 and \u03b8 would scale accordingly. For example, if \u03b8 is 0.5, then for each \u00a31 that the responder is under-compensated, the utility decreases by 0.5. But since \u03b2 is in \u00a3 terms, it's additive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the model should normalize the terms. For example, express everything in terms of percentages or proportions. But given the variables in the dataset, it's easier to use the raw values.\n\nNow, the variables needed for the model are:\n\n- split_self (from data)\n- token_self (from data)\n- max(3*token_self - split_self, 0) (calculated)\n\nThe parameters are \u03b2 and \u03b8.\n\nThe utility function is:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 + split_self - \u03b8 * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nThe probability of acceptance is logistic(Utility).\n\nThis model uses two learnable parameters, which is manageable for parameter recovery. The variables are all available in the dataset. The model focuses on the responder's role (trial_role=1), as required.\n\nNow, let's check if this model meets all the requirements:\n\n1. Predicts responder behavior (accept) - yes, using a logistic model based on utility.\n2. Uses variables from the dataset - split_self and token_self are available.\n3. Parameters have finite bounds: \u03b2 can be between -10 and 10, \u03b8 between 0 and 5 (since \u03b8 can't be negative, as that would imply preferring under-compensation).\n4. Utility is unbounded, but parameters are bounded.\n\nAnother consideration: the variable combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), but in the model, we use 3*token_self, which is derived from token_self. So combined_earning isn't directly used, but it's redundant because 3*token_self is part of it.\n\nNow, let's formalize the model:\n\n<MODEL>\nUtility = beta + split_self - theta * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n</MODEL>\n\nVariables:\n\n- beta: learnable intercept term, bounded between -10 and 10.\n- theta: learnable inequity aversion parameter, bounded between 0 and 5.\n- split_self: from data.\n- token_self: from data.\n- max(3*token_self - split_self, 0): calculated.\n\nThe target variable is 'accept', which is binary (0 or 1). The model predicts the probability of accept=1 via the logistic function applied to Utility.\n\nNow, the variable descriptions in JSON:\n\nFor beta:\n- description: Baseline acceptance tendency (intercept).\n- range: min -10, max 10, inclusive.\n- learnable: true.\n\nFor theta:\n- description: Sensitivity to under-compensation relative to fair share (3 * token_self).\n- range: min 0, max 5, inclusive.\n- learnable: true.\n\nsplit_self and token_self are from data, so their source is 'data', learnable: false.\n\nThe max term is calculated, so it's source: 'calculated'.\n\nThe utility is calculated, so it's source: 'calculated'.\n\nSo the JSON would look like:\n\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Baseline tendency to accept (intercept)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"theta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to under-compensation relative to fair share (3 * token_self)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"max_term\": {\n      \"description\": \"Max of (3 * token_self - split_self) and 0\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"Utility\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposal\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nBut in the model formula, the max_term is part of the utility calculation. However, in the <MODEL> tags, we can write it directly without defining max_term as a separate variable. The variables section should include all variables used in the model formula. So in the model formula, the variables are beta, split_self, theta, token_self (inside the max function). The max(3*token_self - split_self, 0) is a calculated term, but it's not a separate variable in the model equation; it's part of the equation. Therefore, in the variables section, we don't need to list 'max_term' as a separate variable. Instead, the variables used in the model are beta, theta, split_self, and token_self. The max operation is part of the model's mathematical formula.\n\nTherefore, the variables section should include:\n\n- beta (learnable)\n- theta (learnable)\n- split_self (data)\n- token_self (data)\n\nThe other terms are calculated within the model formula.\n\nSo the correct variables JSON would be:\n\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Baseline tendency to accept (intercept)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"theta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to under-compensation relative to fair share (3 * token_self)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThe utility is calculated as per the model formula, using these variables.\n\nFinally, the summary should describe the model concisely. For example:\n\n\"A logistic model where the utility of accepting a proposal depends on the proposed amount, a baseline tendency, and a penalty for being under-compensated relative to one's contribution. The penalty is proportional to the difference between the fair share (3 * token_self) and the proposed amount when the latter is lower.\"\n\nThis captures the key elements: logistic model, utility components, parameters (baseline and penalty), and the fairness calculation.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nUtility = beta + split_self - theta * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Baseline intercept capturing general acceptance tendency\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"theta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to under-compensation relative to fair share (3 * token_self)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed monetary amount for the responder\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Participant's contribution in tokens (converted to \u00a33 per token)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>accept</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA logistic model where acceptance probability depends on a baseline tendency, the proposed monetary amount, and a penalty for offers below the participant's fair share (3 * token_self).

  "full_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts whether a participant (acting as the responder) accepts or rejects a proposal in the given experiment. The model needs to focus on responder behavior, use the provided variables appropriately, and have parameters that can be recovered through parameter estimation. Also, the utility function should be such that a negative utility corresponds to less than 50% probability of acceptance, which suggests using a logistic function where the probability is 1/(1 + exp(-utility)).\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key variables that influence the responder's decision. From the dataset, the variables related to the responder's decision when they are in the responder role (trial_role=1) include:\n\n- token_self: the participant's own contribution (tokens found)\n- token_opp: the opponent's contribution\n- split_self: the proposed share for the participant in \u00a3\n- split_opp: the proposed share for the opponent in \u00a3\n- combined_earning: total money earned (each token is \u00a33, so combined_earning = 3*(token_self + token_opp))\n- trial_type: whether contributions are equal, opponent more, or participant more\n\nThe responder's decision (accept or reject) likely depends on how fair they perceive the split to be, considering both their own contribution and the opponent's. Fairness here could be a comparison between the proposed split and what would be considered equitable based on contributions.\n\nSo, the utility function should incorporate some measure of fairness. One common approach is to model inequity aversion, where individuals prefer equitable outcomes and experience disutility from unequal distributions. Fehr and Schmidt's model of inequity aversion is a classic example here. However, since the contributions (tokens) are part of the task, the model should account for the participants' own contribution and the opponent's contribution when evaluating fairness.\n\nLet me think about how to model the utility. The utility (U) could be a function of the monetary gain (split_self) minus some disutility from inequity. The inequity could be calculated as the difference between the proposed split and what would be a fair split based on contributions.\n\nThe fair split based on contributions would be proportional to each person's contribution. For example, the participant's fair share percentage would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The proposed percentage is splitperc_self. The difference between these could be a factor in the utility.\n\nAlternatively, the monetary amounts could be used. The fair amount would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. The proposed split_self minus this fair amount would be the inequity. If the proposed amount is less than the fair amount, the responder might feel disadvantaged, leading to a lower utility.\n\nBut maybe the model should consider both advantageous and disadvantageous inequity. However, since the responder is deciding to accept or reject, perhaps only disadvantageous inequity (when the responder gets less than their fair share) is relevant. Because if they get more than their fair share, they might still accept, but if they get less, they might reject.\n\nAlternatively, the model could have a parameter that captures sensitivity to any deviation from the fair split, regardless of direction. But given the task, perhaps the responder is more sensitive to being undercompensated relative to their contribution.\n\nAnother angle is to consider the ratio of the proposed split to the fair split. For example, if split_self is less than the fair amount, the ratio would be less than 1, which could be a negative term in the utility.\n\nLet me formalize this. The fair amount for the participant is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Let's call this fair_self. Then, the difference between split_self and fair_self is (split_self - fair_self). If this is positive, the responder is getting more than fair; if negative, less. The utility could be split_self (monetary gain) plus a term that penalizes deviations from fairness. But perhaps the disutility is only when split_self is less than fair_self. So, the disutility could be a parameter multiplied by max(fair_self - split_self, 0). Alternatively, the disutility could be proportional to the difference when split_self < fair_self.\n\nAlternatively, the model could use the ratio of split_self to fair_self. If split_self is less than fair_self, the ratio is less than 1, and the disutility is higher. For example, (fair_self - split_self)/fair_self could be a measure of the relative loss.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to model the utility as:\n\nUtility = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (split_self - fair_self)\n\nBut if split_self is less than fair_self, then (split_self - fair_self) is negative, which would reduce the utility. The parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 could represent the weight on the monetary gain and the weight on fairness, respectively. However, \u03b2 might be negative, so that when split_self is less than fair_self, the utility decreases.\n\nWait, but \u03b1 is the weight on the monetary amount. If \u03b1 is positive, higher split_self increases utility. The fairness term (split_self - fair_self) would be positive if the split is more than fair, negative otherwise. If \u03b2 is positive, then getting more than fair increases utility, which might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the fairness term should be (fair_self - split_self), so that when split_self is less than fair_self, this term is positive, leading to a decrease in utility if \u03b2 is negative. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nAlternatively, the model could have a parameter that captures the sensitivity to being below the fair share. For example:\n\nUtility = split_self + \u03b8 * max(fair_self - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b8 is a learnable parameter that represents the aversion to being undercompensated relative to their contribution. If \u03b8 is positive, then when split_self is less than fair_self, the utility decreases. If \u03b8 is negative, that would imply they prefer being undercompensated, which is unlikely. So \u03b8 should be positive. But in this case, \u03b8 is a penalty term for being underpaid.\n\nAlternatively, the model could use a nonlinear function, but given the need for parameter recovery and simplicity, a linear model might be better.\n\nAnother consideration is the total combined earning. Since each trial has a different combined_earning, the same split_self might represent different fairness levels. For example, if combined_earning is higher, a split_self of \u00a310 might be more or less fair depending on the contributions. So the model must account for the contributions (token_self and token_opp) to compute the fair share.\n\nSo, fair_self = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nBut combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so fair_self simplifies to 3*token_self. Because combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 3*(token_self + token_opp) = 3*token_self. Wait, that's a key insight! Because combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), the fair_self is exactly 3*token_self. Because each token is worth \u00a33. So the fair split for the participant is simply 3 times their own tokens. Similarly, the opponent's fair share is 3*token_opp. Therefore, the fair_self is 3*token_self, and the proposed split_self is the amount offered. So the difference between split_self and fair_self is (split_self - 3*token_self). If this is positive, the responder is getting more than their fair share; if negative, less.\n\nThis simplifies the model because we don't need to compute the ratio each time; fair_self is directly 3*token_self. Therefore, the difference (split_self - 3*token_self) can be used as a measure of inequity. If split_self is less than 3*token_self, the responder is getting less than their fair share, which might lead to rejection.\n\nSo the utility could be modeled as:\n\nUtility = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (split_self - 3*token_self)\n\nBut wait, split_self is part of the utility. Alternatively, the utility could be split_self (monetary gain) plus a term that captures the disutility from inequity. For example:\n\nUtility = split_self + \u03b8 * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b8 is a parameter that represents the sensitivity to being undercompensated. If \u03b8 is positive, then when split_self is less than 3*token_self, the utility decreases. This would make the responder more likely to reject the offer. If \u03b8 is zero, the responder only cares about the monetary gain. If \u03b8 is large and positive, even small under-compensations lead to a significant drop in utility.\n\nAlternatively, the model could use the difference (split_self - 3*token_self) directly. For example:\n\nUtility = split_self + \u03b3 * (split_self - 3*token_self)\n\nBut this would be equivalent to (1 + \u03b3) * split_self - 3*\u03b3 * token_self. Which might not capture the asymmetry between advantageous and disadvantageous inequity. However, since the responder is deciding to accept or reject, perhaps only disadvantageous inequity (split_self < fair_self) matters. Because if the split is more than fair, the responder would likely accept, so the disutility is only when split_self is less than fair_self.\n\nTherefore, using the max function to capture only the negative deviations makes sense. So:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b8 * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b8 is the penalty for being undercompensated. If split_self is less than 3*token_self, the max term is positive, so the utility decreases by \u03b8 times that amount. The higher \u03b8, the more the responder dislikes being undercompensated.\n\nAlternatively, the model could have a non-linear term, but for simplicity and to keep the number of parameters low, a linear term is better.\n\nAnother factor could be the opponent's proposed share. For example, if the opponent is taking a large share (split_opp), the responder might feel that's unfair. But since split_opp is the opponent's proposed share, and split_self is the responder's share, perhaps the model should focus on the responder's own share relative to their contribution.\n\nWait, but in the task description, when the participant is the responder, the split_self is the amount offered to them, and split_opp is the amount the opponent would take. However, combined_earning is split_self + split_opp. So the responder's share is split_self, and the opponent's is split_opp. The fair_self is 3*token_self, and the fair_opp is 3*token_opp. So the responder might compare their split_self to their fair_self, and the opponent's split_opp to their fair_opp. But since the responder's decision is to accept or reject, perhaps they are only concerned with their own share relative to their contribution. Alternatively, they might also consider the opponent's share relative to the opponent's contribution. For example, if the opponent is taking more than their fair share, that could also affect the responder's decision.\n\nBut including both terms might complicate the model. Let's think: if the responder's split_self is less than their fair_self, that's a reason to reject. If the opponent's split_opp is more than their fair_opp, that's another reason to reject. So the total inequity could be the sum of both under-compensation to self and over-compensation to the opponent.\n\nBut this would require two parameters: one for sensitivity to under-self and one for over-opponent. However, to keep the model simple and avoid high covariance between parameters, perhaps combining these into a single term.\n\nAlternatively, the model could consider the difference between the proposed split and the fair split for both parties. For example:\n\nUtility = split_self + \u03b8 * (split_self - 3*token_self) + \u03c6 * (split_opp - 3*token_opp)\n\nBut this introduces two parameters, \u03b8 and \u03c6. If \u03b8 and \u03c6 are both positive, then the responder is happy when they get more than their fair share and when the opponent gets more than their fair share, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if \u03b8 is positive (they like getting more than fair) and \u03c6 is negative (they dislike the opponent getting more than fair), but this complicates the model.\n\nAlternatively, the responder might be averse to both types of inequity: when they are under-compensated and when the opponent is over-compensated. So the total disutility could be the sum of (max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)) and (max(split_opp - 3*token_opp, 0)). Each multiplied by their respective parameters.\n\nSo:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b8_self * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0) - \u03b8_opp * max(split_opp - 3*token_opp, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b8_self is the sensitivity to being under-compensated, and \u03b8_opp is the sensitivity to the opponent being over-compensated. Both parameters would be positive, so higher values mean more aversion to each type of inequity.\n\nBut this introduces two parameters. However, the problem states that the model should have a slight bias towards fewer parameters. So maybe combining them into a single parameter. For example, assuming that the responder is equally sensitive to both types of inequity. Then:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b8 * [max(3*token_self - split_self, 0) + max(split_opp - 3*token_opp, 0)]\n\nBut this assumes that the disutility from under-self and over-opponent are weighted equally, which might not be the case. However, to reduce parameters, this could be a valid approach.\n\nAlternatively, given that split_opp is equal to combined_earning - split_self, and combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), then split_opp = 3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self. So the opponent's over-compensation would be split_opp - 3*token_opp = [3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self] - 3*token_opp = 3*token_self - split_self. Wait, that's interesting. So split_opp - 3*token_opp = 3*token_self - split_self. Therefore, the two terms max(3*token_self - split_self, 0) and max(split_opp - 3*token_opp, 0) are actually the same. Because if split_self < 3*token_self, then 3*token_self - split_self is positive, and split_opp = combined_earning - split_self = 3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self. So split_opp - 3*token_opp = 3*token_self - split_self. Therefore, the two terms are identical. So including both would be redundant. Therefore, the model can capture both types of inequity with a single term.\n\nThis is a crucial insight. Because split_opp - 3*token_opp equals 3*token_self - split_self. Therefore, the opponent's over-compensation is exactly equal to the responder's under-compensation. Therefore, the two terms are the same. So the model only needs to consider one of them. Hence, the disutility can be modeled as \u03b8 multiplied by max(3*token_self - split_self, 0), which captures both the responder's under-compensation and the opponent's over-compensation.\n\nTherefore, the utility function can be simplified to:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b8 * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nThis captures the idea that the responder's utility is their monetary gain minus a penalty proportional to how much they are under-compensated relative to their contribution (which also equals how much the opponent is over-compensated).\n\nNow, the probability of accepting is a logistic function of the utility. So:\n\nP(accept=1) = 1 / (1 + exp(-Utility))\n\nBut the problem states that the utility should be such that less than 0 utility corresponds to less than 50% probability. The logistic function meets this because when utility is negative, the probability is less than 0.5.\n\nNow, the model needs to have learnable parameters. In this case, \u03b8 is the learnable parameter. But perhaps there's another parameter to account for the scaling of the utility. For example, sometimes models include a temperature parameter (inverse of \u03b2 in logistic regression) that scales the utility before applying the logistic function. However, the problem states that the utility may be unbounded, but the parameters must have finite bounds. So perhaps the model should include a scaling parameter.\n\nWait, in logistic regression, the model is:\n\nP = 1 / (1 + exp(- (\u03b20 + \u03b21*x1 + ... )))\n\nHere, the coefficients \u03b2 are learnable. But in our case, the utility is already a linear combination, so perhaps we can model:\n\nUtility = \u03b1 * split_self - \u03b8 * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nBut then \u03b1 and \u03b8 are both learnable parameters. However, if \u03b1 is fixed to 1, then we have:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b8 * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nBut maybe \u03b1 should be a learnable parameter to account for the weight the participant places on the monetary gain. For example, some participants might value each pound more than others. However, if we fix \u03b1=1, then \u03b8 is the only learnable parameter. But perhaps allowing \u03b1 to vary could capture different sensitivities to money versus fairness. However, this introduces another parameter, which could lead to identifiability issues if \u03b1 and \u03b8 are correlated.\n\nAlternatively, since split_self is in pounds, and the model's utility is in a unit that maps to log-odds, perhaps scaling is necessary. For example, if \u03b8 is a scaling factor for the inequity term, but without a parameter for the monetary term, the model might not capture individual differences in how much they value money. However, given the instruction to have a slight bias towards fewer parameters, perhaps using a single parameter \u03b8 is better.\n\nWait, but in the example provided in the task, the model had two learnable parameters. The problem says to have an appropriate number, with a slight bias for fewer. So maybe one or two parameters.\n\nLet me think again. If we set \u03b1=1, then the utility is split_self (monetary gain) minus \u03b8 times the inequity. But perhaps participants have different baseline propensities to accept or reject, which could be captured by an intercept term. For example:\n\nUtility = \u03b1 * split_self - \u03b8 * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0) + \u03b2\n\nHere, \u03b2 is a bias term. If \u03b2 is positive, the participant has a higher baseline tendency to accept; if negative, a tendency to reject. However, adding \u03b2 introduces another parameter. But maybe this is necessary to account for individual differences in overall acceptance rates.\n\nBut the problem states that the model should predict utility where less than 0 corresponds to less than 50% probability. If we include a \u03b2 term, then even if split_self and the inequity term are zero, the utility is \u03b2. So if \u03b2 is negative, the baseline probability is less than 50%, which might be realistic. However, this adds another parameter. But perhaps it's necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intercept is not needed. For example, if when split_self is exactly equal to 3*token_self, the utility is split_self (which is 3*token_self). If the participant is indifferent at this point, the utility should be zero. Wait, no. If split_self is equal to 3*token_self, then the max term is zero, so utility is split_self. But split_self is 3*token_self, which is a positive value. So the utility would be positive, leading to a probability greater than 0.5. But in reality, when the split is exactly fair, the participant might be indifferent, so the utility should be zero. Therefore, perhaps the model should subtract the fair_self from the split_self. Wait, let's re-express:\n\nIf the fair_self is 3*token_self, then the utility could be:\n\nUtility = (split_self - 3*token_self) - \u03b8 * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nBut this simplifies to:\n\nIf split_self >= 3*token_self:\n\nUtility = (split_self - 3*token_self) - 0 = split_self - 3*token_self\n\nIf split_self < 3*token_self:\n\nUtility = (split_self - 3*token_self) - \u03b8*(3*token_self - split_self) = (split_self - 3*token_self) - \u03b8*(3*token_self - split_self) = (1 + \u03b8)*(split_self - 3*token_self)\n\nBut this seems more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the utility should be the difference between split_self and fair_self, minus a penalty when split_self is less than fair_self. Wait, that might not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the utility could be:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b8 * max(fair_self - split_self, 0)\n\nWhich is the same as before. But when split_self equals fair_self, the utility is split_self, which is 3*token_self. This would mean that even when the split is fair, the utility is positive, leading to a high probability of acceptance. Which is correct, as a fair split should be accepted. However, the model needs to have the utility threshold at zero. So when utility is positive, P>0.5; when negative, P<0.5. So in the case of a fair split, the utility is split_self (3*token_self), which is positive, leading to P>0.5. That makes sense.\n\nBut perhaps participants have different baseline sensitivities. For example, some might require more than the fair split to accept, others might accept even a bit less. To capture this, we could include an intercept term \u03b2, which shifts the utility:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b8 * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0) + \u03b2\n\nIn this case, \u03b2 could be negative, indicating a general tendency to reject, or positive, tendency to accept. However, this adds another parameter. But given that each participant has 36 trials, having two parameters (\u03b8 and \u03b2) per participant might be feasible. However, the problem states that the model should have learnable parameters with finite bounds. So perhaps \u03b8 and \u03b2 are both learnable, with \u03b2 bounded between, say, -10 and 10, and \u03b8 between 0 and 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intercept is not necessary. Let's think: when the split is exactly fair (split_self = 3*token_self), the utility is 3*token_self. If the participant's token_self varies across trials, then the utility at fair splits also varies. However, the probability of acceptance would depend on the utility, which is 3*token_self. For example, if token_self is 10, then utility is 30, leading to near-certain acceptance. But in reality, participants might accept fair splits almost always, so this might be acceptable. However, if the model doesn't have an intercept, it might not capture individual differences in baseline acceptance rates. For example, a participant who generally rejects offers (e.g., due to spite) would have a negative \u03b2, but without \u03b2, the model can't capture that.\n\nTherefore, including an intercept term \u03b2 might be necessary. So the utility becomes:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 + split_self - \u03b8 * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b2 is a learnable parameter representing the baseline tendency to accept (if positive) or reject (if negative). \u03b8 is the sensitivity to inequity (under-compensation). Both parameters need to be estimated.\n\nThis model has two learnable parameters: \u03b2 and \u03b8. The parameter \u03b2 can be bounded between, say, -10 and 10, and \u03b8 between 0 and 5 (since \u03b8 represents a penalty, it should be non-negative). The bounds should be generous but finite.\n\nNow, let's check if this model can be identified with the data. Each participant has 36 trials, which is sufficient to estimate two parameters. The parameter recovery would depend on the design of the trials, but given that the offers vary in split_self and token_self, it's plausible.\n\nAnother consideration is the scaling of the variables. split_self is in \u00a3, and token_self is in tokens (each worth \u00a33). The max term (3*token_self - split_self) is also in \u00a3. So \u03b8 is in units of \u00a3^{-1}? Wait, no. Let's see: \u03b8 is multiplied by a \u00a3 term, so \u03b8 has units of 1/\u00a3 to make the entire term unitless (since utility is in \u00a3). Wait, but utility is in \u00a3 terms. However, in the logistic function, the utility is used as a linear predictor, so the units are arbitrary. The parameters \u03b2 and \u03b8 would scale accordingly. For example, if \u03b8 is 0.5, then for each \u00a31 that the responder is under-compensated, the utility decreases by 0.5. But since \u03b2 is in \u00a3 terms, it's additive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the model should normalize the terms. For example, express everything in terms of percentages or proportions. But given the variables in the dataset, it's easier to use the raw values.\n\nNow, the variables needed for the model are:\n\n- split_self (from data)\n- token_self (from data)\n- max(3*token_self - split_self, 0) (calculated)\n\nThe parameters are \u03b2 and \u03b8.\n\nThe utility function is:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 + split_self - \u03b8 * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nThe probability of acceptance is logistic(Utility).\n\nThis model uses two learnable parameters, which is manageable for parameter recovery. The variables are all available in the dataset. The model focuses on the responder's role (trial_role=1), as required.\n\nNow, let's check if this model meets all the requirements:\n\n1. Predicts responder behavior (accept) - yes, using a logistic model based on utility.\n2. Uses variables from the dataset - split_self and token_self are available.\n3. Parameters have finite bounds: \u03b2 can be between -10 and 10, \u03b8 between 0 and 5 (since \u03b8 can't be negative, as that would imply preferring under-compensation).\n4. Utility is unbounded, but parameters are bounded.\n\nAnother consideration: the variable combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), but in the model, we use 3*token_self, which is derived from token_self. So combined_earning isn't directly used, but it's redundant because 3*token_self is part of it.\n\nNow, let's formalize the model:\n\n<MODEL>\nUtility = beta + split_self - theta * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n</MODEL>\n\nVariables:\n\n- beta: learnable intercept term, bounded between -10 and 10.\n- theta: learnable inequity aversion parameter, bounded between 0 and 5.\n- split_self: from data.\n- token_self: from data.\n- max(3*token_self - split_self, 0): calculated.\n\nThe target variable is 'accept', which is binary (0 or 1). The model predicts the probability of accept=1 via the logistic function applied to Utility.\n\nNow, the variable descriptions in JSON:\n\nFor beta:\n- description: Baseline acceptance tendency (intercept).\n- range: min -10, max 10, inclusive.\n- learnable: true.\n\nFor theta:\n- description: Sensitivity to under-compensation relative to fair share (3 * token_self).\n- range: min 0, max 5, inclusive.\n- learnable: true.\n\nsplit_self and token_self are from data, so their source is 'data', learnable: false.\n\nThe max term is calculated, so it's source: 'calculated'.\n\nThe utility is calculated, so it's source: 'calculated'.\n\nSo the JSON would look like:\n\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Baseline tendency to accept (intercept)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"theta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to under-compensation relative to fair share (3 * token_self)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"max_term\": {\n      \"description\": \"Max of (3 * token_self - split_self) and 0\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"Utility\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposal\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nBut in the model formula, the max_term is part of the utility calculation. However, in the <MODEL> tags, we can write it directly without defining max_term as a separate variable. The variables section should include all variables used in the model formula. So in the model formula, the variables are beta, split_self, theta, token_self (inside the max function). The max(3*token_self - split_self, 0) is a calculated term, but it's not a separate variable in the model equation; it's part of the equation. Therefore, in the variables section, we don't need to list 'max_term' as a separate variable. Instead, the variables used in the model are beta, theta, split_self, and token_self. The max operation is part of the model's mathematical formula.\n\nTherefore, the variables section should include:\n\n- beta (learnable)\n- theta (learnable)\n- split_self (data)\n- token_self (data)\n\nThe other terms are calculated within the model formula.\n\nSo the correct variables JSON would be:\n\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Baseline tendency to accept (intercept)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"theta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to under-compensation relative to fair share (3 * token_self)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThe utility is calculated as per the model formula, using these variables.\n\nFinally, the summary should describe the model concisely. For example:\n\n\"A logistic model where the utility of accepting a proposal depends on the proposed amount, a baseline tendency, and a penalty for being under-compensated relative to one's contribution. The penalty is proportional to the difference between the fair share (3 * token_self) and the proposed amount when the latter is lower.\"\n\nThis captures the key elements: logistic model, utility components, parameters (baseline and penalty), and the fairness calculation.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nUtility = beta + split_self - theta * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Baseline intercept capturing general acceptance tendency\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"theta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to under-compensation relative to fair share (3 * token_self)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed monetary amount for the responder\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Participant's contribution in tokens (converted to \u00a33 per token)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>accept</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA logistic model where acceptance probability depends on a baseline tendency, the proposed monetary amount, and a penalty for offers below the participant's fair share (3 * token_self).

The penalty scales with the deficit, controlled by theta. The model uses two learnable parameters (beta, theta) to balance monetary gain and fairness considerations.\nTarget Variable: accept\nPrediction Type: utility\nBIC: 124.64751845334645\nOverall Accuracy: 0.8483\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- beta: r = 0.890\n- theta: r = 0.766"
