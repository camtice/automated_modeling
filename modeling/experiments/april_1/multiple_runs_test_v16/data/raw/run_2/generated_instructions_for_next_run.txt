For run 3, we should further encourage innovative transformations and normalization to reduce scaling issues and improve both fit and parameter recovery. Consider a logarithmic transformation (e.g., log(1+token_self)) to address nonlinearity while also ensuring no division by zero. Revisit the fairness deviation calculation and emphasize that exactly two learnable parameters (beta and gamma) must be used with finite, possibly narrowed bounds (e.g., [-5, 5]). Insist on specifying the entire model using only the tags <MODEL> and <VARIABLES> with no additional explanation in the <MODEL> section, and remind to map the utility to acceptance probability using the logistic function. Emphasize creativity in the transformation and normalization ideas to achieve lower BIC and higher accuracy.

Please create a computational model for predicting responder behavior (binary acceptance decisions) following the guidelines below:

1. Predict the binary variable “accept” using a logistic function applied to a utility (U).
2. Calculate U based on a fairness deviation between the observed monetary share (split_self) and a “fair share” derived using a transformation on token contributions. For instance, consider using a logarithmic transformation to compute:
  fair_share = combined_earning * (log(1 + token_self) / (log(1 + token_self) + log(1 + token_opp)))
3. Define U as:
  U = beta * (split_self - fair_share) + gamma
4. Use exactly two learnable parameters (beta and gamma) with finite parameter bounds (e.g., [-5, 5]) to help ensure improved parameter recovery.
5. Ensure that the utility U is mapped to the probability of accepting as P(accept = 1) = 1/(1 + exp(-U)).
6. Provide the complete mathematical model solely between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags without any additional explanation.
7. In the <VARIABLES> section, include detailed JSON descriptions for every variable (data, calculated, and learnable) with proper finite bounds and flags for learnable parameters.
8. Encourage creative yet parsimonious modifications to the fairness deviation to strive for lower BIC, higher prediction accuracy, and improved parameter recovery.
