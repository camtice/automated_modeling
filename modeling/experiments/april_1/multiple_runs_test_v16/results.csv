For run 3, we should further encourage innovative transformations and normalization to reduce scaling issues and improve both fit and parameter recovery. Consider a logarithmic transformation (e.g., log(1+token_self)) to address nonlinearity while also ensuring no division by zero. Revisit the fairness deviation calculation and emphasize that exactly two learnable parameters (beta and gamma) must be used with finite, possibly narrowed bounds (e.g., [-5, 5]). Insist on specifying the entire model using only the tags <MODEL> and <VARIABLES> with no additional explanation in the <MODEL> section, and remind to map the utility to acceptance probability using the logistic function.

Please create a computational model for predicting responder behavior (binary acceptance decisions) following the guidelines below:

1. Predict the binary variable “accept” using a logistic function applied to a utility (U).
2. Calculate U based on a fairness deviation between the observed monetary share (split_self) and a “fair share” derived using a transformation on token contributions. For instance, consider using a logarithmic transformation to compute:
  fair_share = combined_earning * (log(1 + token_self) / (log(1 + token_self) + log(1 + token_opp)))
3. Define U as:
  U = beta * (split_self - fair_share) + gamma
4. Use exactly two learnable parameters (beta and gamma) with finite parameter bounds (e.g., [-5, 5]) to help ensure improved parameter recovery.
5. Ensure that the utility U is mapped to the probability of accepting as P(accept = 1) = 1/(1 + exp(-U)).
6. Provide the complete mathematical model solely between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags without any additional explanation.
7. In the <VARIABLES> section, include detailed JSON descriptions for every variable (data, calculated, and learnable) with proper finite bounds and flags for learnable parameters.
8. Encourage creative yet parsimonious modifications to the fairness deviation to strive for lower BIC, higher prediction accuracy, and improved parameter recovery.

I will update the instructions to encourage the modeling LLM to explore slight modifications to the existing fairness function calculation and parameter bounds to mitigate high covariance between learnable parameters. I will encourage out‐of‐the‐box thinking by suggesting the possible inclusion of a normalization term or transformation of token counts (e.g., a logarithmic or power transformation) to better scale the variables. I will also urge the model to re-evaluate the finite parameter bounds to allow improved recovery, accuracy, and a lower BIC. I will stress that model complexity should remain restrained (ideally two learnable parameters) but with an option to be creative in how the fairness deviation is computed.

For run 2 of 3, please design a computational model for predicting responder behavior (binary acceptance decisions) with the following updated guidance:

1. Continue predicting the binary variable “accept” using a logistic function applied to a utility (U) value.
2. Base the utility on a fairness deviation between the proposed monetary share (split_self) and a “fair share” derived from token contributions and combined earnings. However, consider modifying or normalizing the fairness deviation. For example, you might apply a transformation (e.g., logarithmic or power law) to token_self, token_opp, or the ratio calculation to better capture nonlinear effects and reduce parameter covariance.
3. Use exactly two learnable parameters (beta and gamma), but re-assess their finite bounds. Consider narrowing bounds (e.g., beta and gamma might be assigned ranges like [-5, 5]) to help improve parameter recovery.
4. Specify the mathematical model solely between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags with no additional words or explanation. Within this, include any innovative transformation you decide for the fairness calculation.
5. In the <VARIABLES> section, provide detailed JSON descriptions for every variable used, ensuring that each has appropriate statistical bounds and is flagged as “learnable” if applicable. Be consistent with the parameter names for later usage (avoid reserved words).
6. Emphasize creativity: explore out-of-the-box modifications to the fairness function (for instance, incorporating an additional scaling factor or transformation) that could potentially lower the BIC and improve both accuracy and parameter recovery.
7. Maintain the logistic mapping from U to the probability of accepting (P(accept = 1)) as 1 / (1 + exp(-U)).
