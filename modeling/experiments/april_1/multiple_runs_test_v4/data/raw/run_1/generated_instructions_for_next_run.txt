Prioritize parsimony in model specification.  Minimize the number of free parameters while maintaining sufficient model complexity to capture key psychological mechanisms. Explicitly address high covariance between parameters by using regularization techniques (e.g., L1 or L2 regularization) during model fitting.  Structure the model to facilitate parameter identifiability.  Clearly define the mapping between model parameters and observable behaviors, providing explicit equations relating them.  Incorporate a detailed sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of parameter changes on model predictions.  Explore alternative mathematical forms (e.g., non-linear functions) to better capture interactions between psychological mechanisms.  Report not only parameter recovery correlations but also confidence intervals and consider using alternative metrics (e.g., root mean squared error, mean absolute error) to assess model fit in addition to BIC and accuracy.
