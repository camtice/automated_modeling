Focus on improving parameter recovery for beta and gamma.  Explore alternative parameterizations to reduce covariance between beta and gamma.  Implement a more robust regularization technique (e.g., elastic net) to address multicollinearity.  Investigate the possibility of non-linear relationships between parameters and observed behaviors, particularly for beta and gamma.  Increase the sample size of the simulated data to improve parameter estimation accuracy.  Conduct a thorough diagnostic analysis of model residuals to identify potential model misspecifications.  Prioritize model fit metrics such as root mean squared error alongside BIC.  Report a full range of fit indices, including AIC and adjusted R-squared where applicable.  Assess the impact of different optimization algorithms on parameter recovery.
