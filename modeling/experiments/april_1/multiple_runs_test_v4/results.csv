probability_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(-utility))","A logistic regression model predicting acceptance of offers based on a utility function combining self-interest, fairness concerns, and the proportion of tokens contributed by the self. The model includes four learnable parameters: alpha (sensitivity to monetary gain), beta (sensitivity to inequity), gamma (weighting of self's token contribution), and delta (weighting of self's contribution proportion). The model uses a logistic function to transform the utility into a probability of acceptance.",v4,"Prioritize parsimony in model specification.  Minimize the number of free parameters while maintaining sufficient model complexity to capture key psychological mechanisms. Explicitly address high covariance between parameters by using regularization techniques (e.g., L1 or L2 regularization) during model fitting.  Structure the model to facilitate parameter identifiability.  Clearly define the mapping between model parameters and observable behaviors, providing explicit equations relating them.  Incorporate a detailed sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of parameter changes on model predictions.  Explore alternative mathematical forms (e.g., non-linear functions) to better capture interactions between psychological mechanisms.

Have an appropriate number or learnable parameters, with a slight bias for less learnable paramters.

First, reason step by step about:

* How these mechanisms interact
* What mathematical form could capture these interactions
* What parameters would be needed to calibrate the model
* How the model variables map to observable behavior",0.5207965066752792,0.6249243547659472,0.22380853566064476,0.1399649181432474

Explore alternative parameterizations to reduce covariance between beta and gamma.  Implement a more robust regularization technique (e.g., elastic net) to address multicollinearity.  Investigate the possibility of non-linear relationships between parameters and observed behaviors, particularly for beta and gamma.  Increase the sample size of the simulated data to improve parameter estimation accuracy.  Conduct a thorough diagnostic analysis of model residuals to identify potential model misspecifications.
