Okay, let's see. The user wants me to improve the instructions for the next run based on the previous results. The previous instructions emphasized reducing learnable parameters due to high covariance, and the results had a good BIC of 149.83 and high accuracy. The parameter recovery for beta was excellent (r=0.976). 

Hmm, so the main issue here might be that even though beta was recovered well, maybe there's still room to optimize the number of parameters. The previous instructions had a slight bias for fewer parameters, but maybe they need to be more explicit about minimizing parameters unless necessary. Also, the high covariance mention was there, but perhaps the model still has parameters that are redundant or could be fixed.

The new instructions should push for even fewer parameters. Maybe suggest fixing certain parameters based on theoretical grounds or empirical data. Also, stress the need to validate that each parameter is necessary and doesn't overlap with others. The original instructions asked to reason about mechanisms and mathematical forms, but maybe adding a step to explicitly check for parameter identifiability and covariance during the design phase would help. Also, since beta recovery was good, maybe the model is on the right track, but other parameters might be causing issues. Wait, the parameter recovery summary only mentions beta. Were there other parameters that weren't recovered well? The user might not have listed them, but the BIC is decent, so maybe the model is okay. Still, to improve, the instructions should enforce stricter checks on parameter necessity and covariance. Maybe include a validation step where each parameter's contribution is tested. Also, suggest using parsimonious mathematical forms that combine mechanisms without adding extra parameters. So, the new instructions should focus on critical parameters, fix others when possible, and rigorously check for identifiability and covariance.

Prioritize strict parameter parsimony while maintaining psychological plausibility. Begin by identifying the MINIMAL set of non-redundant parameters required to capture core mechanisms, fixing others to theoretically justified values. Explicitly:

1) For each proposed parameter, justify its necessity using both:
   - Empirical evidence of individual differences in the target behavior
   - Simulation-based identifiability checks showing low covariance (< |r| < 0.7) with other parameters

2) Use composite terms where possible (e.g., ratio-based computations rather than separate weighting parameters) to reduce dimensionality while preserving mechanistic interpretability

3) Include an a priori covariance matrix analysis during model design to detect and eliminate redundant parameters before implementation

4) Validate that each parameter's effect on model behavior cannot be replicated by adjusting other parameters in the system
