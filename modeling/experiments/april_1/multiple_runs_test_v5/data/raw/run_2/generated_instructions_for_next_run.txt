Alright, the user provided the previous results and the new instructions they want me to generate. Let me start by understanding the previous run's outcomes. The average BIC improved to 142.18, which is lower than the previous 149.83, indicating a better model fit. The accuracy slightly decreased from 0.89 to 0.844, but that might be a trade-off for fewer parameters. The parameter recovery for beta dropped from 0.976 to 0.707, and alpha and gamma are around 0.56-0.57, which isn't great.

The previous instructions emphasized strict parameter parsimony, composite terms, covariance analysis, and validation. The new results show that while BIC improved, parameter recovery suffered, especially for beta. This suggests that maybe the model became too simplistic, leading to parameters being conflated or not identifiable. 

So, the next instructions need to balance parsimony with ensuring parameters are recoverable. The user's goal is to maintain low BIC but improve parameter recovery. The previous instructions might have been too aggressive in reducing parameters, causing important mechanisms to be oversimplified. 

I should adjust the instructions to allow necessary parameters but with rigorous checks. Maybe instead of fixing parameters, find a middle ground where each parameter is justified with empirical evidence and identifiability. Also, suggest using hierarchical modeling if individual differences are significant. The covariance threshold was set at 0.7, but maybe that's too lenient. Lowering it could help reduce redundancy. Additionally, cross-validation during model design might help in assessing parameter necessity without overfitting. 

Including a step to test parameter recovery through simulated data before finalizing the model could preemptively catch issues. Also, considering interactions between parameters might help in designing composite terms that don't sacrifice recoverability. The new instructions should stress empirical justification, identifiability checks with stricter covariance thresholds, simulation-based validation, and perhaps hierarchical structures if needed.

Prioritize identifiability-optimized parsimony through these steps:

1) Implement hierarchical parameterization where appropriate:
   - Individual-level parameters ONLY for dimensions with empirical evidence of between-subject variance
   - Shared population-level parameters for stable cognitive operations

2) Enforce geometric constraint checking:
   - Reject any parameter configuration where pairwise correlations > |0.6| in recovery simulations
   - Require orthogonal parameter effects (Î”BIC > 5 when individually varied)

3) Use nonlinear compression for related mechanisms:
   - Implement sigmoidal transforms instead of separate threshold parameters
   - Replace additive terms with normalized products where theoretically justified

4) Conduct sequential identifiability testing:
   a) Simulate recovery with ground truth parameters
   b) Prune parameters showing posterior overlap (R-hat > 1.05)
   c) Validate through cross-parameter prediction tests (r > 0.7 required)

5) Maintain explicit biological plausibility anchors:
   - Fix parameters to literature-derived values when experimental manipulations exist
   - Constrain parameter ranges using neural/physiological measurement boundaries
