      "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts whether a participant (as the responder) accepts or rejects a proposal. The model needs to focus on responder behavior, use the given variables appropriately, and ensure parameter recovery is possible.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which variables are relevant. The target is 'accept', which is binary (0 or 1). The model should predict this based on utility, where utility less than 0 means less than 50% chance of accepting.\n\nKey variables from the dataset for a responder role (trial_role=1) would be token_self (participant's contribution), token_opp (opponent's contribution), combined_earning, split_self (proposed share for participant), and splitperc_self. Since the trial_type indicates who contributed more, that might relate to fairness perceptions.\n\nThe utility function should capture the participant's evaluation of the offer. A common approach is to compare the proposed split to what's considered fair. But since the combined earning varies, fairness might be relative to contributions.\n\nPossible factors influencing utility:\n1. Material self-interest: The actual amount offered (split_self).\n2. Fairness consideration: How the split compares to the participant's contribution relative to the total. For example, if the participant contributed more tokens, they might expect a higher share.\n3. Discrepancy between expected fair share and proposed share.\n\nLet's model the fair share as the proportion of tokens the participant contributed. So, fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. The proposed share is split_self. The difference between these could drive rejection.\n\nBut the utility might also have a parameter for how sensitive the participant is to unfairness. Let's call this \u03b1 (alpha). If the proposed share is less than the fair share, the utility decreases.\n\nAnother parameter could be the curvature of the utility function for money, say \u03b2 (beta), which could capture diminishing sensitivity to monetary amounts.\n\nAdditionally, participants might have different thresholds for accepting based on absolute amounts, not just proportions. So maybe a parameter \u03b3 (gamma) that represents the minimum acceptable amount, regardless of fairness.\n\nBut the problem states that the model should have learnable parameters with finite bounds. Let's consider which parameters are necessary.\n\nPossible parameters:\n- \u03b1 (alpha): Sensitivity to unfairness (positive if averse to unfairness).\n- \u03b2 (beta): Sensitivity to the proposed amount (curvature).\n- \u03b3 (gamma): Baseline acceptance bias (could be intercept term).\n\nBut to keep it simple and ensure parameter recovery, maybe start with a linear model. For example:\n\nUtility = \u03b2_self * split_self + \u03b1 * (fair_share - split_self) + \u03b3\n\nHere, \u03b2_self is the weight on the proposed amount, \u03b1 is the weight on the unfairness (difference between fair share and proposed), and \u03b3 is a bias term. If Utility > 0, accept (with probability determined by logistic function).\n\nBut fair_share is calculated as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Since combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), because each token is \u00a33, then combined_earning = 3*(token_self + token_opp). Therefore, fair_share = token_self * 3. So the fair share in pounds is exactly 3 times the participant's tokens. Wait, because combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so each token is \u00a33. So the participant's contribution is worth 3* token_self, and the opponent's is 3* token_opp. So the fair share based on contribution would be (3*token_self) / (3*(token_self + token_opp)) ) * combined_earning. Wait, but combined_earning is already 3*(token_self + token_opp). So that simplifies to (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 3*(token_self + token_opp) ) = 3*token_self. So the fair share is exactly 3*token_self. But split_self is the proposed amount. So the difference between fair_share and split_self is (3*token_self - split_self). If this is positive, the participant is getting less than their fair share, which might lead to rejection.\n\nSo the utility could be modeled as:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (3*token_self - split_self) + \u03b3\n\nBut maybe \u03b1 is a parameter that scales the unfairness term. Alternatively, the model could use the ratio of proposed to fair share. For example:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * ( (split_self / (3*token_self)) - 1 ) + \u03b3\n\nBut this might complicate things. Alternatively, the model could use the difference between the proposed percentage (splitperc_self) and the fair percentage (which would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100). But splitperc_self is already provided as a percentage.\n\nWait, splitperc_self is the proposed percentage for the participant. The fair percentage would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. So the difference is splitperc_self - fair_percent. If this is negative, the participant is getting less than fair.\n\nSo another approach:\n\nfair_percent = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100\nunfairness = fair_percent - splitperc_self\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * unfairness + \u03b3\n\nBut split_self is in pounds, and unfairness is in percentage points. The parameters \u03b2 and \u03b1 would have to scale these appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, since the model needs to predict based on utility, which is converted via logistic function to probability, perhaps the utility is a linear combination of terms that capture the monetary gain and the unfairness.\n\nAnother consideration: when the participant is the responder, they might compare their proposed split to both their own contribution and the opponent's. For example, if the opponent contributed more, maybe the participant is more willing to accept a lower split.\n\nBut to keep the model parsimonious, perhaps focus on two key factors: the monetary value of the offer (split_self) and the discrepancy from the fair share based on contributions (3*token_self - split_self). The idea is that participants derive utility both from the absolute amount they receive and from how fair that amount is relative to their contribution.\n\nSo the utility function could be:\n\nU = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(0, 3*token_self - split_self) + \u03b3\n\nHere, \u03b2 is the sensitivity to the offered amount, \u03b1 is the sensitivity to being underpaid relative to their contribution, and \u03b3 is a bias term. The max function ensures that only when the offer is less than the fair share (3*token_self) does the unfairness penalty apply.\n\nAlternatively, the unfairness term could be squared to make it a quadratic loss, but that would introduce another parameter. To keep it simple, linear terms.\n\nThe probability of accepting is then logistic(U). If U > 0, the probability is greater than 0.5.\n\nNow, parameters \u03b2, \u03b1, and \u03b3 need to be learnable with appropriate bounds.\n\n\u03b2 should be positive because higher offers are better. So \u03b2 \u2208 [0, some upper bound].\n\n\u03b1 should also be positive because being under the fair share reduces utility. So \u03b1 \u2208 [0, ...].\n\n\u03b3 could be any real number, but since it's a bias term, maybe bounded between -10 and 10.\n\nBut the problem states that parameters must have finite bounds. Let's set:\n\n\u03b2: [0, 10] (sensitivity to monetary gain)\n\u03b1: [0, 10] (sensitivity to unfairness)\n\u03b3: [-10, 10] (bias term)\n\nThese ranges are generous but finite.\n\nNow, the model equation would be:\n\nU = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(0, 3*token_self - split_self) + \u03b3\n\nThen, the probability of accepting is 1 / (1 + exp(-U)).\n\nThis model uses split_self and token_self from the data. The other variables like token_opp are used indirectly via the fair share calculation (3*token_self is the fair share based on their own tokens, but combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), but in the fair share calculation, the fair share would be 3*token_self, which is the participant's contribution in pounds. Wait, no: each token is \u00a33, so token_self tokens are worth 3*token_self. The total combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). The fair share based on contribution would be (3*token_self) / (3*(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Wait, but combined_earning is exactly 3*(token_self + token_opp), so the fair share is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 3*(token_self + token_opp) ) = 3*token_self. So yes, the fair share is 3*token_self. Therefore, the model's unfairness term is correct.\n\nSo the model uses split_self (proposed amount) and token_self (to compute fair share). The max function ensures that only when the offer is below the fair share does the penalty apply.\n\nThis model has three parameters: \u03b2, \u03b1, \u03b3. All learnable with specified bounds.\n\nNow, check if this model meets the requirements:\n\n1. Predict responder behavior (accept) - yes, using U in logistic function.\n2. Uses variables available in the dataset: split_self, token_self. Others like token_opp are not directly used but are part of the combined_earning, which is accounted for in the fair share calculation (since 3*token_self is part of the combined_earning).\n3. Parameters have finite bounds.\n4. Utility can be unbounded, but in practice, the logistic function converts it to a probability.\n\nAnother consideration: maybe the participant also cares about the opponent's share. For example, if the opponent is taking more than their fair share, even if the participant's share is fair, they might reject. But that complicates the model. Since the task says to focus on responder behavior and the model should be parsimonious, perhaps stick to the current variables.\n\nAlternatively, the unfairness could be the difference between the proposed split and the fair split, regardless of direction. But the max function in the current model only penalizes when the participant is getting less than their fair share. If the participant is getting more, maybe that doesn't affect utility. But maybe some participants are inequity averse and dislike getting more than fair. However, that would require another parameter. To keep it simple, the model only penalizes when the offer is below the fair share.\n\nThus, the final model is:\n\nU = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(0, fair_share - split_self) + \u03b3\n\nWhere fair_share = 3 * token_self.\n\nBut in the dataset, combined_earning is given as a variable. Wait, combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So fair_share based on contribution is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Which simplifies to 3*token_self. So the model's fair_share is correctly calculated as 3*token_self.\n\nTherefore, the model uses split_self and token_self. The other variables like token_opp are not directly used but are part of the combined_earning, which is already accounted for in the fair_share calculation.\n\nNow, variable descriptions:\n\n\u03b2: sensitivity to the proposed amount (split_self). Range [0,10], inclusive.\n\n\u03b1: sensitivity to being under the fair share. Range [0,10], inclusive.\n\n\u03b3: bias term, intercept. Range [-10,10], inclusive.\n\nThese parameters are learnable. The variables split_self and token_self come from the data.\n\nThe utility U is calculated, then passed through a logistic function to get the probability of accepting.\n\nSo the mathematical model is:\n\nU = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(0, 3 * token_self - split_self) + \u03b3\n\nThen, P(accept=1) = 1 / (1 + exp(-U))\n\nThis should meet the requirements. The parameters are bounded, and the model uses only the necessary variables from the dataset.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU = beta * split_self - alpha * max(0, 3 * token_self - split_self) + gamma\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposal\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to absolute monetary gain (\u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to unfairness when receiving less than contributed value (3 * token_self)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"gamma\": {\n      \"description\": \"Baseline acceptance bias/intercept\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed \u00a3 amount for participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Participant's tokens contributed to shared pot\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>accept</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA three-parameter utility model evaluating absolute monetary gain against contribution-based fairness expectations.

  "full_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts whether a participant (as the responder) accepts or rejects a proposal. The model needs to focus on responder behavior, use the given variables appropriately, and ensure parameter recovery is possible.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which variables are relevant. The target is 'accept', which is binary (0 or 1). The model should predict this based on utility, where utility less than 0 means less than 50% chance of accepting.\n\nKey variables from the dataset for a responder role (trial_role=1) would be token_self (participant's contribution), token_opp (opponent's contribution), combined_earning, split_self (proposed share for participant), and splitperc_self. Since the trial_type indicates who contributed more, that might relate to fairness perceptions.\n\nThe utility function should capture the participant's evaluation of the offer. A common approach is to compare the proposed split to what's considered fair. But since the combined earning varies, fairness might be relative to contributions.\n\nPossible factors influencing utility:\n1. Material self-interest: The actual amount offered (split_self).\n2. Fairness consideration: How the split compares to the participant's contribution relative to the total. For example, if the participant contributed more tokens, they might expect a higher share.\n3. Discrepancy between expected fair share and proposed share.\n\nLet's model the fair share as the proportion of tokens the participant contributed. So, fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. The proposed share is split_self. The difference between these could drive rejection.\n\nBut the utility might also have a parameter for how sensitive the participant is to unfairness. Let's call this \u03b1 (alpha). If the proposed share is less than the fair share, the utility decreases.\n\nAnother parameter could be the curvature of the utility function for money, say \u03b2 (beta), which could capture diminishing sensitivity to monetary amounts.\n\nAdditionally, participants might have different thresholds for accepting based on absolute amounts, not just proportions. So maybe a parameter \u03b3 (gamma) that represents the minimum acceptable amount, regardless of fairness.\n\nBut the problem states that the model should have learnable parameters with finite bounds. Let's consider which parameters are necessary.\n\nPossible parameters:\n- \u03b1 (alpha): Sensitivity to unfairness (positive if averse to unfairness).\n- \u03b2 (beta): Sensitivity to the proposed amount (curvature).\n- \u03b3 (gamma): Baseline acceptance bias (could be intercept term).\n\nBut to keep it simple and ensure parameter recovery, maybe start with a linear model. For example:\n\nUtility = \u03b2_self * split_self + \u03b1 * (fair_share - split_self) + \u03b3\n\nHere, \u03b2_self is the weight on the proposed amount, \u03b1 is the weight on the unfairness (difference between fair share and proposed), and \u03b3 is a bias term. If Utility > 0, accept (with probability determined by logistic function).\n\nBut fair_share is calculated as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Since combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), because each token is \u00a33, then combined_earning = 3*(token_self + token_opp). Therefore, fair_share = token_self * 3. So the fair share in pounds is exactly 3 times the participant's tokens. Wait, because combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so each token is \u00a33. So the participant's contribution is worth 3* token_self, and the opponent's is 3* token_opp. So the fair share based on contribution would be (3*token_self) / (3*(token_self + token_opp)) ) * combined_earning. Wait, but combined_earning is already 3*(token_self + token_opp). So that simplifies to (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 3*(token_self + token_opp) ) = 3*token_self. So the fair share is exactly 3*token_self. But split_self is the proposed amount. So the difference between fair_share and split_self is (3*token_self - split_self). If this is positive, the participant is getting less than their fair share, which might lead to rejection.\n\nSo the utility could be modeled as:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (3*token_self - split_self) + \u03b3\n\nBut maybe \u03b1 is a parameter that scales the unfairness term. Alternatively, the model could use the ratio of proposed to fair share. For example:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * ( (split_self / (3*token_self)) - 1 ) + \u03b3\n\nBut this might complicate things. Alternatively, the model could use the difference between the proposed percentage (splitperc_self) and the fair percentage (which would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100). But splitperc_self is already provided as a percentage.\n\nWait, splitperc_self is the proposed percentage for the participant. The fair percentage would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. So the difference is splitperc_self - fair_percent. If this is negative, the participant is getting less than fair.\n\nSo another approach:\n\nfair_percent = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100\nunfairness = fair_percent - splitperc_self\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * unfairness + \u03b3\n\nBut split_self is in pounds, and unfairness is in percentage points. The parameters \u03b2 and \u03b1 would have to scale these appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, since the model needs to predict based on utility, which is converted via logistic function to probability, perhaps the utility is a linear combination of terms that capture the monetary gain and the unfairness.\n\nAnother consideration: when the participant is the responder, they might compare their proposed split to both their own contribution and the opponent's. For example, if the opponent contributed more, maybe the participant is more willing to accept a lower split.\n\nBut to keep the model parsimonious, perhaps focus on two key factors: the monetary value of the offer (split_self) and the discrepancy from the fair share based on contributions (3*token_self - split_self). The idea is that participants derive utility both from the absolute amount they receive and from how fair that amount is relative to their contribution.\n\nSo the utility function could be:\n\nU = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(0, 3*token_self - split_self) + \u03b3\n\nHere, \u03b2 is the sensitivity to the offered amount, \u03b1 is the sensitivity to being underpaid relative to their contribution, and \u03b3 is a bias term. The max function ensures that only when the offer is less than the fair share (3*token_self) does the unfairness penalty apply.\n\nAlternatively, the unfairness term could be squared to make it a quadratic loss, but that would introduce another parameter. To keep it simple, linear terms.\n\nThe probability of accepting is then logistic(U). If U > 0, the probability is greater than 0.5.\n\nNow, parameters \u03b2, \u03b1, and \u03b3 need to be learnable with appropriate bounds.\n\n\u03b2 should be positive because higher offers are better. So \u03b2 \u2208 [0, some upper bound].\n\n\u03b1 should also be positive because being under the fair share reduces utility. So \u03b1 \u2208 [0, ...].\n\n\u03b3 could be any real number, but since it's a bias term, maybe bounded between -10 and 10.\n\nBut the problem states that parameters must have finite bounds. Let's set:\n\n\u03b2: [0, 10] (sensitivity to monetary gain)\n\u03b1: [0, 10] (sensitivity to unfairness)\n\u03b3: [-10, 10] (bias term)\n\nThese ranges are generous but finite.\n\nNow, the model equation would be:\n\nU = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(0, 3*token_self - split_self) + \u03b3\n\nThen, the probability of accepting is 1 / (1 + exp(-U)).\n\nThis model uses split_self and token_self from the data. The other variables like token_opp are used indirectly via the fair share calculation (3*token_self is the fair share based on their own tokens, but combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), but in the fair share calculation, the fair share would be 3*token_self, which is the participant's contribution in pounds. Wait, no: each token is \u00a33, so token_self tokens are worth 3*token_self. The total combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). The fair share based on contribution would be (3*token_self) / (3*(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Wait, but combined_earning is exactly 3*(token_self + token_opp), so the fair share is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 3*(token_self + token_opp) ) = 3*token_self. So yes, the fair share is 3*token_self. Therefore, the model's unfairness term is correct.\n\nSo the model uses split_self (proposed amount) and token_self (to compute fair share). The max function ensures that only when the offer is below the fair share does the penalty apply.\n\nThis model has three parameters: \u03b2, \u03b1, \u03b3. All learnable with specified bounds.\n\nNow, check if this model meets the requirements:\n\n1. Predict responder behavior (accept) - yes, using U in logistic function.\n2. Uses variables available in the dataset: split_self, token_self. Others like token_opp are not directly used but are part of the combined_earning, which is accounted for in the fair share calculation (since 3*token_self is part of the combined_earning).\n3. Parameters have finite bounds.\n4. Utility can be unbounded, but in practice, the logistic function converts it to a probability.\n\nAnother consideration: maybe the participant also cares about the opponent's share. For example, if the opponent is taking more than their fair share, even if the participant's share is fair, they might reject. But that complicates the model. Since the task says to focus on responder behavior and the model should be parsimonious, perhaps stick to the current variables.\n\nAlternatively, the unfairness could be the difference between the proposed split and the fair split, regardless of direction. But the max function in the current model only penalizes when the participant is getting less than their fair share. If the participant is getting more, maybe that doesn't affect utility. But maybe some participants are inequity averse and dislike getting more than fair. However, that would require another parameter. To keep it simple, the model only penalizes when the offer is below the fair share.\n\nThus, the final model is:\n\nU = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(0, fair_share - split_self) + \u03b3\n\nWhere fair_share = 3 * token_self.\n\nBut in the dataset, combined_earning is given as a variable. Wait, combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So fair_share based on contribution is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Which simplifies to 3*token_self. So the model's fair_share is correctly calculated as 3*token_self.\n\nTherefore, the model uses split_self and token_self. The other variables like token_opp are not directly used but are part of the combined_earning, which is already accounted for in the fair_share calculation.\n\nNow, variable descriptions:\n\n\u03b2: sensitivity to the proposed amount (split_self). Range [0,10], inclusive.\n\n\u03b1: sensitivity to being under the fair share. Range [0,10], inclusive.\n\n\u03b3: bias term, intercept. Range [-10,10], inclusive.\n\nThese parameters are learnable. The variables split_self and token_self come from the data.\n\nThe utility U is calculated, then passed through a logistic function to get the probability of accepting.\n\nSo the mathematical model is:\n\nU = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(0, 3 * token_self - split_self) + \u03b3\n\nThen, P(accept=1) = 1 / (1 + exp(-U))\n\nThis should meet the requirements. The parameters are bounded, and the model uses only the necessary variables from the dataset.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU = beta * split_self - alpha * max(0, 3 * token_self - split_self) + gamma\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposal\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to absolute monetary gain (\u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to unfairness when receiving less than contributed value (3 * token_self)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"gamma\": {\n      \"description\": \"Baseline acceptance bias/intercept\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed \u00a3 amount for participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Participant's tokens contributed to shared pot\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>accept</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA three-parameter utility model evaluating absolute monetary gain against contribution-based fairness expectations.
