The first term compares the offered amount to the participant's token-based fair share (3×token_self). The second term penalizes offers where the opponent receives more than the participant.

Alright, the user provided the previous results and the new instructions they want me to generate. Let me start by understanding the previous run's outcomes. The average BIC improved to 142.18, which is lower than the previous 149.83, indicating a better model fit. The accuracy slightly decreased from 0.89 to 0.844, but that might be a trade-off for fewer parameters. The parameter recovery for beta dropped from 0.976 to 0.707, and alpha and gamma are around 0.56-0.57, which isn't great.

The previous instructions emphasized strict parameter parsimony, composite terms, covariance analysis, and validation. The new results show that while BIC improved, parameter recovery suffered, especially for beta. This suggests that maybe the model became too simplistic, leading to parameters being conflated or not identifiable. 

So, the next instructions need to balance parsimony with ensuring parameters are recoverable. The user's goal is to maintain low BIC but improve parameter recovery. The previous instructions might have been too aggressive in reducing parameters, causing important mechanisms to be oversimplified. 

I should adjust the instructions to allow necessary parameters but with rigorous checks. Maybe instead of fixing parameters, find a middle ground where each parameter is justified with empirical evidence and identifiability. Also, suggest using hierarchical modeling if individual differences are significant. The covariance threshold was set at 0.7, but maybe that's too lenient. Lowering it could help reduce redundancy. Additionally, cross-validation during model design might help in assessing parameter necessity without overfitting. 

Including a step to test parameter recovery through simulated data before finalizing the model could preemptively catch issues. Also, considering interactions between parameters might help in designing composite terms that don't sacrifice recoverability. The new instructions should stress empirical justification, identifiability checks with stricter covariance thresholds, simulation-based validation, and perhaps hierarchical structures if needed.

Prioritize identifiability-optimized parsimony through these steps:

1) Implement hierarchical parameterization where appropriate:
   - Individual-level parameters ONLY for dimensions with empirical evidence of between-subject variance
   - Shared population-level parameters for stable cognitive operations

2) Enforce geometric constraint checking:
   - Reject any parameter configuration where pairwise correlations > |0.6| in recovery simulations
   - Require orthogonal parameter effects (ΔBIC > 5 when individually varied)

3) Use nonlinear compression for related mechanisms:
   - Implement sigmoidal transforms instead of separate threshold parameters
   - Replace additive terms with normalized products where theoretically justified

4) Conduct sequential identifiability testing:
   a) Simulate recovery with ground truth parameters
   b) Prune parameters showing posterior overlap (R-hat > 1.05)
   c) Validate through cross-parameter prediction tests (r > 0.7 required)

5) Maintain explicit biological plausibility anchors:
   - Fix parameters to literature-derived values when experimental manipulations exist
   - Constrain parameter ranges using neural/physiological measurement boundaries",0.3041499530812834,0.41823944900215587,

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to improve the instructions for the next run based on the previous results. The previous instructions emphasized reducing learnable parameters due to high covariance, and the results had a good BIC of 149.83 and high accuracy. The parameter recovery for beta was excellent (r=0.976). 

Hmm, so the main issue here might be that even though beta was recovered well, maybe there's still room to optimize the number of parameters. The previous instructions had a slight bias for fewer parameters, but maybe they need to be more explicit about minimizing parameters unless necessary. Also, the high covariance mention was there, but perhaps the model still has parameters that are redundant or could be fixed.

The new instructions should push for even fewer parameters. Maybe suggest fixing certain parameters based on theoretical grounds or empirical data. Also, stress the need to validate that each parameter is necessary and doesn't overlap with others. The original instructions asked to reason about mechanisms and mathematical forms, but maybe adding a step to explicitly check for parameter identifiability and covariance during the design phase would help. Also, since beta recovery was good, maybe the model is on the right track, but other parameters might be causing issues. Wait, the parameter recovery summary only mentions beta. Were there other parameters that weren't recovered well? The user might not have listed them, but the BIC is decent, so maybe the model is okay. Still, to improve, the instructions should enforce stricter checks on parameter necessity and covariance. Maybe include a validation step where each parameter's contribution is tested. Also, suggest using parsimonious mathematical forms that combine mechanisms without adding extra parameters. So, the new instructions should focus on critical parameters, fix others when possible, and rigorously check for identifiability and covariance.

Prioritize strict parameter parsimony while maintaining psychological plausibility. Begin by identifying the MINIMAL set of non-redundant parameters required to capture core mechanisms, fixing others to theoretically justified values. Explicitly:

1) For each proposed parameter, justify its necessity using both:
   - Empirical evidence of individual differences in the target behavior
   - Simulation-based identifiability checks showing low covariance (< |r| < 0.7) with other parameters

2) Use composite terms where possible (e.g., ratio-based computations rather than separate weighting parameters) to reduce dimensionality while preserving mechanistic interpretability

3) Include an a priori covariance matrix analysis during model design to detect and eliminate redundant parameters before implementation

4) Validate that each parameter's effect on model behavior cannot be replicated by adjusting other parameters in the system",0.7068683334096666,0.5648842027444473,0.5711653890512728
