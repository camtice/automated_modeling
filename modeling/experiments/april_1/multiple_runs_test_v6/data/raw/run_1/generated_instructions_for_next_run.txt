Focus on mathematical implementations that inherently minimize parameter covariance through constrained interactions. Prioritize parameter identifiability by:  
1. Using saturating functions (e.g., sigmoids) or normalized terms where appropriate  
2. Explicitly testing whether each parameter produces unique behavioral signatures via synthetic data checks  
3. Implementing parameter transformations (e.g., softplus for bounds) rather than raw free parameters  

Maintain maximum parsimony while ensuring:  
- Critical cognitive operations (e.g., value updating, choice competition) are explicitly represented as separable computational modules  
- Each parameter governs exactly one psychologically distinct process  
- Dynamic interactions between mechanisms are mediated through observable trial-level variables rather than hidden states  

Include validation steps where intermediate model outputs (e.g., trial-wise likelihoods) are compared to empirical choice distributions before final parameter estimation.
