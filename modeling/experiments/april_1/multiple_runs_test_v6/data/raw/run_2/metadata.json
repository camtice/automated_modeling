      "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts whether a participant (as the responder) accepts or rejects a proposal in the given experiment. The model needs to focus on responder behavior, use the provided variables appropriately, and ensure parameter recovery is feasible. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dataset and the variables involved. The key variables here are the ones related to the proposals and the participants' responses. Since the target is 'accept', which is a binary variable (1 or 0), the model should output a probability of acceptance, which can be modeled using a logistic function of some utility. \n\nThe model should predict utility, where a utility less than 0 corresponds to less than 50% probability of accepting. So, the utility function needs to capture the factors influencing the responder's decision. \n\nLooking at the variables, the important ones for the responder's decision would likely be the proposed splits (split_self and split_opp), the tokens found by both (token_self and token_opp), and the combined earnings. The trial_type might also play a role, indicating whether contributions were equal, opponent more, or participant more. \n\nBut how do these variables interact? The responder's decision probably depends on fairness considerations and their own gain. The utility could be a function of the proposed split compared to some fairness reference point. \n\nOne approach is to model the utility as the difference between the proposed share for the self (split_self) and what's considered a fair share. The fair share might be based on the participant's contribution (token_self) relative to the total contribution (token_self + token_opp). \n\nFor example, the fair split percentage would be token_self / (token_self + token_opp) * 100. The proposed percentage (splitperc_self) can be compared to this fair percentage. The difference between the proposed and fair percentage could be a key factor, scaled by a parameter representing sensitivity to unfairness. \n\nAdditionally, the absolute amount of split_self might matter. Even if the split is unfair, a higher absolute amount might still be acceptable. So, the utility could have a term for the proposed amount and a term for the fairness deviation. \n\nAnother consideration is the trial_type. If the trial_type indicates that the opponent contributed more, the responder might have different thresholds for acceptance. However, trial_type is a categorical variable, which might complicate the model. Alternatively, since token_self and token_opp are available, trial_type can be derived from these, so maybe it's redundant. \n\nSo, the utility function could be:\n\nUtility = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (splitperc_self - fair_perc) \n\nWhere fair_perc is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. \n\nBut wait, split_self is in pounds, and combined_earning is token_self + token_opp multiplied by \u00a33. So combined_earning = 3*(token_self + token_opp). The fair split in pounds would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. So split_self - fair_share would be the difference in pounds. Alternatively, using percentages as in splitperc_self vs fair_perc. \n\nAlternatively, the model could use the difference between the proposed split and the fair split in monetary terms. Let's compute the fair_share_self as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Then, the difference is split_self - fair_share_self. \n\nBut maybe participants are sensitive to both the absolute amount they receive (split_self) and the deviation from fairness. So the utility could be a combination of these two factors. \n\nAnother angle is that participants might compare their split to the opponent's. If split_self is less than split_opp, that's unfair against them. But the split_opp is the opponent's proposed share, which might not be directly comparable. Wait, in the responder role, the participant is responding to the opponent's proposal. So split_self is what the opponent is offering to the participant, and split_opp is what the opponent is keeping. So the total is split_self + split_opp = combined_earning. \n\nSo, the fair split for the participant would be based on their contribution (token_self) versus the opponent's (token_opp). The fair split_self would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. \n\nThe difference between the proposed split_self and the fair split_self could be a key term. Let's call this \u0394 = split_self - fair_share_self. \n\nIf \u0394 is positive, the participant is getting more than fair; if negative, less. The utility could then be a function of \u0394. But participants might also care about the absolute amount they receive. For example, even if the split is unfair (\u0394 negative), if split_self is high enough, they might still accept. \n\nSo, perhaps the utility is a combination of the absolute split_self and the \u0394 term. \n\nAlternatively, the utility could be modeled as:\n\nUtility = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (split_self - fair_share_self)\n\nBut this might lead to multicollinearity if split_self and fair_share_self are related. Alternatively, since fair_share_self is (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning, and combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), then fair_share_self = 3 * token_self. Because combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * 3*(token_self + token_opp) = 3*token_self. So fair_share_self is simply 3 * token_self. \n\nWait, that's a key insight! Because combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), the fair share for the participant is exactly 3 * token_self. Because their contribution is token_self tokens, each worth \u00a33. So their fair share is their own contribution's value. The opponent's fair share is 3 * token_opp. \n\nSo, the fair_share_self is 3 * token_self. The proposed split_self is the amount offered to the participant. So the difference between split_self and fair_share_self is split_self - 3*token_self. \n\nThis is a crucial point. The participant's fair share is exactly the value of their own tokens. So if the proposed split_self is less than 3*token_self, that's unfair (they get less than they contributed). If it's more, it's advantageous. \n\nTherefore, the utility could be modeled as:\n\nUtility = \u03b1 * (split_self - 3*token_self) + \u03b2 * split_self\n\nWait, but this combines two terms: the difference from fair share and the absolute amount. Alternatively, maybe participants have a trade-off between fairness and greed. The term (split_self - 3*token_self) captures fairness (how much more or less than their contribution they're getting), and split_self captures the absolute gain. \n\nBut perhaps participants are more sensitive to the ratio or the difference. Let's think. If \u03b1 is positive, then getting more than fair increases utility. If \u03b2 is positive, higher absolute split_self increases utility. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the model should have a term for the difference from fair share and a separate term for the absolute amount. But that might lead to parameters that are hard to identify. \n\nAlternatively, the utility could be:\n\nUtility = \u03b1 * (split_self - \u03b8 * 3 * token_self)\n\nHere, \u03b8 is a parameter that represents the weight given to the fair share. If \u03b8=1, then the fair share is exactly 3*token_self. If \u03b8 <1, the participant is willing to accept less than their fair share. If \u03b8>1, they demand more. \n\nBut \u03b8 could be a learnable parameter. However, this might not capture the absolute amount. Alternatively, maybe the utility is the difference between split_self and their fair share, scaled by a parameter, plus another parameter for the baseline utility of accepting. \n\nAlternatively, the model could use a Fehr-Schmidt inequality aversion model, where utility depends on one's own payoff and the difference between own and others' payoffs. But in this case, the opponent's payoff is split_opp, which is combined_earning - split_self. \n\nBut the Fehr-Schmidt model has parameters for aversion to disadvantageous inequality (when others get more) and advantageous inequality (when you get more). However, given that the task is about accepting or rejecting a proposal, perhaps the responder's decision is based on their own share relative to their contribution and the opponent's share. \n\nAlternatively, the utility could be:\n\nUtility = split_self + \u03b1 * max{(3*token_self - split_self), 0} + \u03b2 * max{(split_self - 3*token_self), 0}\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, the disutility from unfairness could be modeled as a loss when split_self is less than fair, and a gain when it's more. But perhaps participants are only averse to being below the fair share, not caring if they're above. \n\nSo, the utility could be:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b1 * max{(3*token_self - split_self), 0}\n\nHere, \u03b1 represents the sensitivity to being below the fair share. If the proposed split_self is less than their fair share (3*token_self), the utility decreases by \u03b1 times the deficit. If it's equal or more, the utility is just split_self. \n\nThis model has one parameter \u03b1, which must be positive. The probability of accepting is then a logistic function of Utility. If Utility >0, the probability is greater than 0.5. \n\nBut wait, the problem states that the utility should be such that less than 0 corresponds to less than 50% probability. So the logistic function would map Utility to a probability via P(accept) = 1 / (1 + exp(-Utility)). So when Utility is negative, P <0.5. \n\nBut in this model, Utility is split_self minus \u03b1 times the deficit. So even if split_self is high, but the deficit is large (split_self < fair), the utility could be negative. For example, if split_self is 5, fair is 10, and \u03b1 is 1, then Utility =5 -1*(10-5)=0. So P=0.5. If split_self is 4, then Utility=4 -6= -2, P= ~0.12. \n\nBut maybe participants also have a baseline acceptance tendency. For example, even if the utility is split_self - \u03b1*(fair - split_self), maybe there's an intercept term. \n\nAlternatively, the model could be:\n\nUtility = \u03b3 * split_self - \u03b1 * max{(fair_self - split_self), 0} \n\nWhere \u03b3 is a parameter scaling the importance of the absolute amount. If \u03b3 is 1, then it's the same as before. But allowing \u03b3 to be learned could capture how much participants value the absolute amount versus the fairness. \n\nBut introducing \u03b3 and \u03b1 might complicate parameter recovery. However, with 36 trials per participant, it's possible to estimate two parameters. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the model should include a term for the ratio of split_self to fair_self. For example, split_self / fair_self. If that's greater than 1, it's advantageous. But using ratios can introduce nonlinearities. \n\nAlternatively, the utility could be a linear combination of split_self and the difference from fair_self. \n\nBut given the problem's constraints, the model needs to be simple enough for parameter recovery but capture the essential aspects. \n\nAnother consideration is the combined_earning. Since combined_earning is fixed per trial (3*(token_self + token_opp)), and split_self + split_opp = combined_earning, perhaps the opponent's split is not directly needed, as it's determined once split_self is known. \n\nSo, focusing on split_self and fair_self (3*token_self). \n\nPutting this together, the utility function could be:\n\nUtility = \u03b8 * split_self - \u03b1 * max{(3*token_self - split_self), 0} \n\nHere, \u03b8 represents the marginal utility of money (how much each pound increases utility), and \u03b1 represents the penalty for receiving less than the fair share. Both parameters must be positive. \n\nThe probability of accepting is then logistic(Utility). \n\nBut \u03b8 and \u03b1 might be difficult to disentangle. For example, if \u03b8 is high, even a small split_self could be acceptable if \u03b1 is low. Alternatively, \u03b8 could be fixed to 1, assuming linear utility for money, and only \u03b1 is learned. But the problem allows for learnable parameters, so perhaps both \u03b8 and \u03b1 are learnable. \n\nHowever, to ensure parameter identifiability, perhaps \u03b8 should be fixed. For example, setting \u03b8=1, so Utility = split_self - \u03b1 * max{(fair_self - split_self), 0}. This reduces the model to one parameter, \u03b1, which is the penalty for unfairness. \n\nBut the problem states that the model should have parameters that can be recovered, so maybe two parameters are manageable. \n\nAlternatively, another approach is to model the utility as the difference between the proposed split and the fair split, scaled by a parameter. For example:\n\n\u0394 = split_self - fair_self\nUtility = \u03b1 * \u0394 + \u03b2 * split_self \n\nBut this combines the difference and the absolute amount. However, this might lead to parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 that are hard to distinguish. For instance, if \u03b1 and \u03b2 are both positive, they both contribute positively to Utility. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the model should use a reference point. The reference point is the fair_self, and the utility is the difference from this reference, plus a term for the absolute value. \n\nBut I need to think about what makes the parameters identifiable. For example, if the model is Utility = (split_self - fair_self) + \u03b2 * split_self, then it's equivalent to Utility = (1 + \u03b2) * split_self - fair_self. This is a linear combination, but the parameters might not be uniquely identifiable because they combine into a single coefficient for split_self. \n\nAlternatively, using a non-linear function. For example, a sigmoid function to model diminishing returns on the split_self. But the problem states to use saturating functions where appropriate. \n\nWait, the instructions mention using saturating functions or normalized terms to aid parameter identifiability. So perhaps the split_self is normalized by the combined_earning, or the fair_self. \n\nAlternatively, the utility could be modeled as:\n\nUtility = (split_self / fair_self - 1) * \u03b1 + \u03b2 * (split_self / combined_earning)\n\nHere, the first term captures the proportional difference from the fair share, scaled by \u03b1. The second term is the proportion of the total earnings offered to the participant, scaled by \u03b2. \n\nBut this introduces two parameters. However, if combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), and fair_self is 3*token_self, then split_self / fair_self is split_self/(3*token_self), and split_self / combined_earning is split_self/(3*(token_self + token_opp)). \n\nBut this might complicate the model. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the fair_self is 3*token_self, and the total is 3*(token_self + token_opp), the fair percentage is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The proposed percentage is splitperc_self. So the difference in percentages could be a factor. \n\nSo, the utility could be:\n\nUtility = \u03b1 * (splitperc_self - fair_perc) + \u03b2 * split_self \n\nWhere fair_perc is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. \n\nBut split_self is in pounds, and splitperc_self is a percentage. These are different scales. To combine them, perhaps they need to be normalized. \n\nAlternatively, split_self can be divided by combined_earning to get the same as splitperc_self / 100. So split_self = (splitperc_self / 100) * combined_earning. \n\nBut this might mean that split_self and splitperc_self are collinear. So including both might not add value. \n\nGiven that, perhaps using splitperc_self and fair_perc is sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, the utility could be based on the difference between the proposed percentage and the fair percentage, scaled by a parameter, plus the proposed percentage itself. \n\nBut this might not capture the absolute amount. For example, a 50% split of a large total is more money than a 50% split of a small total. \n\nAlternatively, the utility could have a term for the proposed amount (split_self) and a term for the unfairness (split_self - fair_self). \n\nBut split_self - fair_self is the same as (split_self - 3*token_self). \n\nSo, Utility = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (split_self - 3*token_self)\n\nThis simplifies to Utility = (\u03b1 + \u03b2) * split_self - \u03b2 * 3 * token_self. \n\nBut this is a linear model with two parameters, but they might not be identifiable because they combine into coefficients for split_self and token_self. \n\nAlternatively, if we fix \u03b1=1, then Utility = split_self + \u03b2*(split_self - 3*token_self). This would be equivalent to (1 + \u03b2) * split_self - \u03b2*3*token_self. \n\nBut again, this may not be the best approach. \n\nAnother angle: participants might have a threshold of what's acceptable. The threshold could be a combination of their fair share and some additional amount. For example, they might accept if split_self >= \u03bb * fair_self, where \u03bb is a parameter between 0 and some upper bound. \n\nBut this is a deterministic model. To make it probabilistic, the utility could be the difference between split_self and \u03bb * fair_self, with noise. \n\nSo, Utility = split_self - \u03bb * fair_self + \u03b5, where \u03b5 is a noise term. The probability of accepting is then P(accept) = logistic(Utility / \u03c3), where \u03c3 is the noise scale. But \u03c3 can be fixed (e.g., 1) for identifiability. \n\nIn this case, \u03bb is the learnable parameter. If \u03bb=1, the threshold is the fair share. If \u03bb <1, the participant is willing to accept less than fair; if \u03bb>1, they demand more. \n\nThis model has one parameter, \u03bb, which is bounded (e.g., between 0 and 2). The utility is split_self - \u03bb * fair_self. \n\nBut this model assumes that the utility is linear in split_self and fair_self. However, participants might have nonlinear utility for money. But given the need for simplicity, this might be acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, the model could use a ratio: split_self / fair_self. If this ratio is greater than \u03bb, accept. But again, this would be a threshold model. \n\nBut to make it probabilistic, the utility could be the ratio minus \u03bb, scaled by a parameter. \n\nUtility = \u03b1 * (split_self / fair_self - \u03bb) \n\nHere, \u03b1 is a sensitivity parameter. If the ratio is greater than \u03bb, utility is positive. \n\nBut this introduces two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03bb. \n\nAlternatively, combining both the absolute and relative terms. \n\nBut perhaps the simplest model that captures the key aspects is the one where utility is the difference between the proposed split and a scaled fair share. \n\nSo, Utility = split_self - \u03bb * fair_self \n\nHere, \u03bb is a learnable parameter. If \u03bb=1, the fair share is the threshold. If \u03bb=0.8, the participant accepts even if they get 80% of their fair share. \n\nThe probability of accepting is then logistic(Utility). \n\nBut this model has only one parameter, \u03bb. However, the problem allows for multiple parameters. \n\nBut maybe participants also have a baseline tendency to accept or reject, independent of the split. So adding an intercept term. \n\nUtility = \u03b2_0 + split_self - \u03bb * fair_self \n\nHere, \u03b2_0 is a bias term. If \u03b2_0 is positive, the participant is more likely to accept even if split_self is less than \u03bb*fair_self. \n\nBut this introduces two parameters, \u03b2_0 and \u03bb. \n\nHowever, with 36 trials per participant, two parameters might be feasible. \n\nBut the problem states that the model should pass parameter recovery tests, so the parameters need to be identifiable. \n\nAnother consideration is that the split_self and fair_self (3*token_self) are in the same units (\u00a3), so combining them directly is feasible. \n\nSo, the model could be:\n\nUtility = \u03b2_0 + \u03b2_split * split_self + \u03b2_fair * (split_self - fair_self) \n\nBut this is equivalent to:\n\nUtility = \u03b2_0 + (\u03b2_split + \u03b2_fair) * split_self - \u03b2_fair * fair_self \n\nWhich again combines parameters in a way that might make them hard to identify. \n\nAlternatively, to separate the effects, perhaps:\n\nUtility = \u03b2_split * split_self + \u03b2_fair * (split_self / fair_self - 1) \n\nHere, \u03b2_split captures the utility from the absolute amount, and \u03b2_fair captures the utility from the proportional deviation from fair. \n\nBut this introduces two parameters. \n\nAlternatively, using a single parameter that combines both effects. \n\nBut perhaps the most parsimonious model is the one with a single parameter \u03bb, representing the trade-off between the proposed split and the fair share. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the utility could be a weighted sum of the proposed split and the fair share. \n\nUtility = \u03b1 * split_self + (1 - \u03b1) * fair_self \n\nBut this would require \u03b1 to be between 0 and 1, and the utility would be a convex combination. However, this might not capture the trade-off correctly. \n\nAlternatively, the model could use the difference between split_self and fair_self, scaled by a parameter. \n\nUtility = \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_self) \n\nHere, \u03b1 is a sensitivity parameter. If \u03b1 is positive, higher split_self than fair_self increases utility. \n\nBut this ignores the absolute value of split_self. For example, if two offers have the same difference (split_self - fair_self), but one has a higher split_self, the utility would be the same. But in reality, a higher split_self might be more acceptable even if the difference is the same. \n\nHmm. This is a problem. For example, suppose fair_self is \u00a310. Offer A is \u00a312 (difference +\u00a32), Offer B is \u00a315 (difference +\u00a35). If \u03b1 is positive, Offer B has higher utility. But if another offer has fair_self \u00a320, and split_self \u00a322 (difference +\u00a32), same difference as Offer A, but higher absolute. The utility would be the same if only the difference is considered. But participants might prefer \u00a322 over \u00a312 even if the difference is the same. \n\nThus, the model should include both the difference and the absolute term. But this brings us back to the earlier problem of parameter identifiability. \n\nAlternatively, the model could use the ratio of split_self to fair_self. \n\nUtility = \u03b1 * (split_self / fair_self - 1) \n\nThis represents the proportional gain over the fair share. If split_self is equal to fair_self, utility is 0. If it's higher, positive; lower, negative. \n\nBut this doesn't account for the absolute amount. For example, a 10% increase over fair_self when fair_self is \u00a310 gives \u00a311, but when fair_self is \u00a320 gives \u00a322. The utility would be the same (0.1 * \u03b1), but the absolute gains are different. Participants might value the absolute gain more. \n\nThis suggests that the model should include both proportional and absolute terms, but again, this complicates parameter recovery. \n\nGiven the constraints of the problem and the need for parameter recovery, perhaps the best approach is to use a model with two parameters: one for the sensitivity to the difference from the fair share, and another for the sensitivity to the absolute split. \n\nSo, the utility function could be:\n\nUtility = \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_self) + \u03b2 * split_self \n\nSimplifying, this becomes:\n\nUtility = (\u03b1 + \u03b2) * split_self - \u03b1 * fair_self \n\nBut this combines \u03b1 and \u03b2 into a coefficient for split_self. To make the parameters identifiable, perhaps we can reparameterize. For example, let \u03b3 = \u03b1 + \u03b2 and \u03b4 = \u03b1. Then, Utility = \u03b3 * split_self - \u03b4 * fair_self. But this doesn't solve the identifiability issue because \u03b3 and \u03b4 are combinations of \u03b1 and \u03b2. \n\nAlternatively, if we fix one parameter. For example, set \u03b2=1, so Utility = split_self + \u03b1*(split_self - fair_self). This becomes Utility = (1 + \u03b1) * split_self - \u03b1 * fair_self. \n\nBut this still has two parameters. Wait, no\u2014if \u03b2 is fixed to 1, then \u03b1 is the only learnable parameter. \n\nAlternatively, the model could be:\n\nUtility = split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_self) \n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nUtility = (1 + \u03b1) * split_self - \u03b1 * fair_self \n\nHere, \u03b1 is a learnable parameter that determines how much the difference from the fair share matters relative to the absolute split. If \u03b1 is positive, the participant places more weight on the difference (i.e., fairness). If \u03b1 is zero, only the absolute split matters. \n\nThis model has one learnable parameter, \u03b1, which can be bounded between, say, -1 and 1 to prevent extreme values. But this might not be necessary; the bounds can be generous. \n\nHowever, this model assumes that the utility is linear in both split_self and the difference. But perhaps participants have diminishing sensitivity. For example, the difference might matter more when it's a loss (split_self < fair_self) than when it's a gain. \n\nTo capture this, we can split the difference into loss and gain components. \n\nUtility = split_self + \u03b1 * max(fair_self - split_self, 0) + \u03b2 * max(split_self - fair_self, 0) \n\nHere, \u03b1 represents the penalty for being below the fair share, and \u03b2 represents the reward for being above. If \u03b1 and \u03b2 are different, it allows for asymmetric sensitivity. \n\nBut this introduces two parameters. However, with 36 trials, estimating two parameters might be feasible. \n\nBut the problem states that the model should prioritize parameter recovery. To ensure identifiability, perhaps we can set \u03b2=0, assuming that participants only penalize offers below the fair share and don't reward offers above. \n\nSo, Utility = split_self + \u03b1 * max(fair_self - split_self, 0) \n\nWait, no. If \u03b1 is positive, then when split_self < fair_self, the utility decreases. So the model becomes:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b1 * (fair_self - split_self) \n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nUtility = (1 + \u03b1) * split_self - \u03b1 * fair_self \n\nBut this is similar to the previous model. \n\nAlternatively, if \u03b1 is a penalty parameter, the utility could be:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_self - split_self, 0) \n\nThis way, when the offer is below fair, the utility is reduced by \u03b1 times the deficit. If the offer is above fair, the utility is just split_self. \n\nThis model has one parameter, \u03b1, which must be non-negative. \n\nThis seems plausible. For example, if \u03b1=0, the participant only cares about the absolute split_self. If \u03b1>0, they penalize offers below their fair share. \n\nThe probability of accepting is then logistic(Utility). \n\nBut in this model, even if the offer is below fair, if split_self is high enough, the utility could still be positive. For example, fair_self=10, split_self=8, \u03b1=1. Utility=8 -1*(2)=6. So P(accept)=logistic(6)\u22481. But if split_self=5, \u03b1=1, utility=5-5=0 \u2192 P=0.5. \n\nWait, that's not right. If split_self=5, fair_self=10, then max(fair_self - split_self,0)=5. So utility=5 - \u03b1*5. If \u03b1=1, utility=0. So P=0.5. If \u03b1=2, utility=5-10= -5 \u2192 P\u22480. \n\nThis model implies that when the offer is exactly fair (split_self=10), utility=10. So P\u22481. \n\nBut maybe participants have a different baseline. For example, even if the offer is fair, there's a cost to accepting, or a baseline tendency. \n\nAlternatively, adding an intercept term:\n\nUtility = \u03b2_0 + split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_self - split_self, 0) \n\nHere, \u03b2_0 could capture a general bias to accept (if positive) or reject (if negative). \n\nBut this introduces two parameters. However, with 36 trials, this might be manageable. \n\nBut the problem states that the model should predict utility where less than 0 corresponds to less than 50% probability. So the intercept term could be part of the utility. \n\nBut how to ensure that the parameters are identifiable. For example, if \u03b2_0 is positive, it could offset a negative utility from the split. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intercept is not necessary, and the model can rely solely on the split_self and fairness term. \n\nAnother consideration is the participant's own contribution (token_self). The fair_self is 3*token_self, so perhaps participants with higher token_self have higher fair_self, and thus higher expectations. \n\nBut the model already incorporates fair_self as 3*token_self, so that's accounted for. \n\nPutting this all together, the model that includes both the absolute split and the penalty for being below fair_self with one parameter seems plausible. \n\nBut to also account for the possibility that participants might have different sensitivities to the absolute amount, perhaps the model should include a scaling parameter for split_self. \n\nSo:\n\nUtility = \u03b3 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_self - split_self, 0) \n\nHere, \u03b3 scales the utility from the absolute split, and \u03b1 is the penalty for being below fair. Both parameters are positive. \n\nThis model has two parameters. However, \u03b3 and \u03b1 might be difficult to recover if they are correlated. For example, a high \u03b3 and high \u03b1 could lead to similar behavior as a low \u03b3 and low \u03b1. \n\nTo address this, perhaps \u03b3 can be fixed to 1, assuming linear utility for money. Then the model becomes:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_self - split_self, 0) \n\nThis reduces the model to one parameter, \u03b1, which is the penalty for unfairness. \n\nThis is a simpler model and likely more identifiable. \n\nTesting this model: if \u03b1=0, the utility is split_self, so higher offers are more likely to be accepted. If \u03b1>0, offers below fair_self are penalized. \n\nFor example, if fair_self=10, split_self=8, \u03b1=1: utility=8 - 2=6 \u2192 P=logistic(6)\u22481. \n\nWait, that's not right. If split_self=8 is below fair_self=10, then the penalty is 2*\u03b1. So utility=8 - 2*\u03b1. If \u03b1=1, utility=6 \u2192 P\u22481. But if \u03b1=3, utility=8-6=2 \u2192 P\u22480.88. \n\nBut this seems counterintuitive. If the penalty is higher, the utility decreases more for the same deficit. \n\nWait, no. If \u03b1=3, then for split_self=8, utility=8 -3*(10-8)=8-6=2. So higher \u03b1 increases the penalty. \n\nBut in this case, even with \u03b1=3, the utility is still positive, so P>0.5. \n\nBut if split_self=5, fair_self=10, \u03b1=1: utility=5-5=0 \u2192 P=0.5. \n\nIf \u03b1=2: utility=5-10= -5 \u2192 P\u22480. \n\nSo, this model allows \u03b1 to control the sensitivity to unfairness. Higher \u03b1 means participants are less tolerant of offers below fair_self. \n\nThis seems plausible. \n\nBut what if the offer is above fair_self? Then, the penalty term is zero, and utility=split_self. So even if the offer is very generous, the utility is just the split_self. \n\nBut participants might have diminishing marginal utility for money. For example, the difference between \u00a310 and \u00a320 is more significant than between \u00a3110 and \u00a3120. \n\nHowever, given the task's context and the need for simplicity, assuming linear utility for money might be acceptable. \n\nThus, the model would be:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_self - split_self, 0) \n\nWhere \u03b1 is a learnable parameter with a lower bound of 0 (since penalty can't be negative). \n\nThe probability of accepting is logistic(Utility). \n\nThis model has one parameter, \u03b1, which is bounded below by 0. \n\nBut the problem allows for multiple parameters. Maybe adding another parameter, like a sensitivity to the opponent's contribution. \n\nAlternatively, considering the trial_type variable. For example, in trials where the opponent contributed more (trial_type=2), participants might be more lenient. But trial_type is derived from token_self and token_opp, so perhaps it's redundant. \n\nAlternatively, participants might compare their contribution to the opponent's. For example, if they contributed more, they might demand a higher split. But this is already captured in fair_self. \n\nAnother angle: the utility could include a term that accounts for the opponent's proposed share (split_opp). But since split_opp = combined_earning - split_self, it's redundant. \n\nAlternatively, participants might care about the ratio of their split to the opponent's split. For example, split_self / split_opp. But this ratio can be expressed in terms of split_self and combined_earning. \n\nBut this complicates the model. \n\nGiven the time constraints and the need for a model that balances accuracy and parameter recovery, the single-parameter model seems appropriate. \n\nHowever, the problem statement mentions that the model should utilize the given variables appropriately but not necessarily all. So, using split_self and token_self (to compute fair_self) is acceptable. \n\nThus, the final model is:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_self - split_self, 0) \n\nWhere fair_self = 3 * token_self. \n\nThis model uses split_self and token_self from the dataset. \n\nThe parameter \u03b1 has a lower bound of 0 (inclusive) and an upper bound that can be set generously, say 10. \n\nThe target variable is 'accept', which is binary. The probability of accept is 1 / (1 + exp(-Utility)). \n\nThis model should satisfy the requirements: it predicts responder behavior, uses relevant variables, has a learnable parameter with bounds, and the utility can be negative (leading to P<0.5). \n\nNow, to write this formally in mathematical notation. \n\nThe fair_self is 3 * token_self. \n\nThe utility is:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b1 * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0) \n\nThis can be written as:\n\nU = s_self - \u03b1 * max(3 * t_self - s_self, 0) \n\nWhere s_self is split_self and t_self is token_self. \n\nThe probability of acceptance is logistic(U). \n\nNow, the variables in the model are:\n\n- s_self (split_self): from data\n- t_self (token_self): from data\n- \u03b1: learnable parameter, >=0\n\nSo, the model in <MODEL> tags would be:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nBut in mathematical notation, using LaTeX-style symbols:\n\nU = \\text{split\\_self} - \\alpha \\cdot \\max(3 \\cdot \\text{token\\_self} - \\text{split\\_self}, 0)\n\nBut since the model must be enclosed in <MODEL> tags and use variable names as per the dataset, perhaps using the actual variable names. \n\nWait, the variables in the dataset are named as split_self and token_self. So the model can directly reference these. \n\nThus, the model is:\n\n<MODEL>\nutility = split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n</MODEL>\n\nThe variable alpha is a learnable parameter with a min of 0 and a reasonable max, say 10. \n\nThe variables section would then describe alpha, split_self, token_self, and utility. \n\nThe target variable is 'accept', which is predicted via the logistic function applied to utility. \n\nNow, the variable descriptions:\n\n- split_self: from data, type float64.\n- token_self: from data, type int64.\n- alpha: learnable parameter, range [0, 10], inclusive.\n- utility: calculated variable.\n\nThe utility is unbounded, as it can go from negative infinity (if split_self is very low and alpha is high) to positive infinity (if split_self is very high). \n\nThus, the JSON structure would be:\n\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity parameter for penalty when split_self is below fair share (3 * token_self)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"utility\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposal\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThe summary should describe the model concisely. \n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model where acceptance probability depends on the proposed amount and a penalty for offers below the participant's fair share (3 * token_self).

  "full_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts whether a participant (as the responder) accepts or rejects a proposal in the given experiment. The model needs to focus on responder behavior, use the provided variables appropriately, and ensure parameter recovery is feasible. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dataset and the variables involved. The key variables here are the ones related to the proposals and the participants' responses. Since the target is 'accept', which is a binary variable (1 or 0), the model should output a probability of acceptance, which can be modeled using a logistic function of some utility. \n\nThe model should predict utility, where a utility less than 0 corresponds to less than 50% probability of accepting. So, the utility function needs to capture the factors influencing the responder's decision. \n\nLooking at the variables, the important ones for the responder's decision would likely be the proposed splits (split_self and split_opp), the tokens found by both (token_self and token_opp), and the combined earnings. The trial_type might also play a role, indicating whether contributions were equal, opponent more, or participant more. \n\nBut how do these variables interact? The responder's decision probably depends on fairness considerations and their own gain. The utility could be a function of the proposed split compared to some fairness reference point. \n\nOne approach is to model the utility as the difference between the proposed share for the self (split_self) and what's considered a fair share. The fair share might be based on the participant's contribution (token_self) relative to the total contribution (token_self + token_opp). \n\nFor example, the fair split percentage would be token_self / (token_self + token_opp) * 100. The proposed percentage (splitperc_self) can be compared to this fair percentage. The difference between the proposed and fair percentage could be a key factor, scaled by a parameter representing sensitivity to unfairness. \n\nAdditionally, the absolute amount of split_self might matter. Even if the split is unfair, a higher absolute amount might still be acceptable. So, the utility could have a term for the proposed amount and a term for the fairness deviation. \n\nAnother consideration is the trial_type. If the trial_type indicates that the opponent contributed more, the responder might have different thresholds for acceptance. However, trial_type is a categorical variable, which might complicate the model. Alternatively, since token_self and token_opp are available, trial_type can be derived from these, so maybe it's redundant. \n\nSo, the utility function could be:\n\nUtility = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (splitperc_self - fair_perc) \n\nWhere fair_perc is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. \n\nBut wait, split_self is in pounds, and combined_earning is token_self + token_opp multiplied by \u00a33. So combined_earning = 3*(token_self + token_opp). The fair split in pounds would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. So split_self - fair_share would be the difference in pounds. Alternatively, using percentages as in splitperc_self vs fair_perc. \n\nAlternatively, the model could use the difference between the proposed split and the fair split in monetary terms. Let's compute the fair_share_self as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Then, the difference is split_self - fair_share_self. \n\nBut maybe participants are sensitive to both the absolute amount they receive (split_self) and the deviation from fairness. So the utility could be a combination of these two factors. \n\nAnother angle is that participants might compare their split to the opponent's. If split_self is less than split_opp, that's unfair against them. But the split_opp is the opponent's proposed share, which might not be directly comparable. Wait, in the responder role, the participant is responding to the opponent's proposal. So split_self is what the opponent is offering to the participant, and split_opp is what the opponent is keeping. So the total is split_self + split_opp = combined_earning. \n\nSo, the fair split for the participant would be based on their contribution (token_self) versus the opponent's (token_opp). The fair split_self would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. \n\nThe difference between the proposed split_self and the fair split_self could be a key term. Let's call this \u0394 = split_self - fair_share_self. \n\nIf \u0394 is positive, the participant is getting more than fair; if negative, less. The utility could then be a function of \u0394. But participants might also care about the absolute amount they receive. For example, even if the split is unfair (\u0394 negative), if split_self is high enough, they might still accept. \n\nSo, perhaps the utility is a combination of the absolute split_self and the \u0394 term. \n\nAlternatively, the utility could be modeled as:\n\nUtility = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (split_self - fair_share_self)\n\nBut this might lead to multicollinearity if split_self and fair_share_self are related. Alternatively, since fair_share_self is (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning, and combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), then fair_share_self = 3 * token_self. Because combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * 3*(token_self + token_opp) = 3*token_self. So fair_share_self is simply 3 * token_self. \n\nWait, that's a key insight! Because combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), the fair share for the participant is exactly 3 * token_self. Because their contribution is token_self tokens, each worth \u00a33. So their fair share is their own contribution's value. The opponent's fair share is 3 * token_opp. \n\nSo, the fair_share_self is 3 * token_self. The proposed split_self is the amount offered to the participant. So the difference between split_self and fair_share_self is split_self - 3*token_self. \n\nThis is a crucial point. The participant's fair share is exactly the value of their own tokens. So if the proposed split_self is less than 3*token_self, that's unfair (they get less than they contributed). If it's more, it's advantageous. \n\nTherefore, the utility could be modeled as:\n\nUtility = \u03b1 * (split_self - 3*token_self) + \u03b2 * split_self\n\nWait, but this combines two terms: the difference from fair share and the absolute amount. Alternatively, maybe participants have a trade-off between fairness and greed. The term (split_self - 3*token_self) captures fairness (how much more or less than their contribution they're getting), and split_self captures the absolute gain. \n\nBut perhaps participants are more sensitive to the ratio or the difference. Let's think. If \u03b1 is positive, then getting more than fair increases utility. If \u03b2 is positive, higher absolute split_self increases utility. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the model should have a term for the difference from fair share and a separate term for the absolute amount. But that might lead to parameters that are hard to identify. \n\nAlternatively, the utility could be:\n\nUtility = \u03b1 * (split_self - \u03b8 * 3 * token_self)\n\nHere, \u03b8 is a parameter that represents the weight given to the fair share. If \u03b8=1, then the fair share is exactly 3*token_self. If \u03b8 <1, the participant is willing to accept less than their fair share. If \u03b8>1, they demand more. \n\nBut \u03b8 could be a learnable parameter. However, this might not capture the absolute amount. Alternatively, maybe the utility is the difference between split_self and their fair share, scaled by a parameter, plus another parameter for the baseline utility of accepting. \n\nAlternatively, the model could use a Fehr-Schmidt inequality aversion model, where utility depends on one's own payoff and the difference between own and others' payoffs. But in this case, the opponent's payoff is split_opp, which is combined_earning - split_self. \n\nBut the Fehr-Schmidt model has parameters for aversion to disadvantageous inequality (when others get more) and advantageous inequality (when you get more). However, given that the task is about accepting or rejecting a proposal, perhaps the responder's decision is based on their own share relative to their contribution and the opponent's share. \n\nAlternatively, the utility could be:\n\nUtility = split_self + \u03b1 * max{(3*token_self - split_self), 0} + \u03b2 * max{(split_self - 3*token_self), 0}\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, the disutility from unfairness could be modeled as a loss when split_self is less than fair, and a gain when it's more. But perhaps participants are only averse to being below the fair share, not caring if they're above. \n\nSo, the utility could be:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b1 * max{(3*token_self - split_self), 0}\n\nHere, \u03b1 represents the sensitivity to being below the fair share. If the proposed split_self is less than their fair share (3*token_self), the utility decreases by \u03b1 times the deficit. If it's equal or more, the utility is just split_self. \n\nThis model has one parameter \u03b1, which must be positive. The probability of accepting is then a logistic function of Utility. If Utility >0, the probability is greater than 0.5. \n\nBut wait, the problem states that the utility should be such that less than 0 corresponds to less than 50% probability. So the logistic function would map Utility to a probability via P(accept) = 1 / (1 + exp(-Utility)). So when Utility is negative, P <0.5. \n\nBut in this model, Utility is split_self minus \u03b1 times the deficit. So even if split_self is high, but the deficit is large (split_self < fair), the utility could be negative. For example, if split_self is 5, fair is 10, and \u03b1 is 1, then Utility =5 -1*(10-5)=0. So P=0.5. If split_self is 4, then Utility=4 -6= -2, P= ~0.12. \n\nBut maybe participants also have a baseline acceptance tendency. For example, even if the utility is split_self - \u03b1*(fair - split_self), maybe there's an intercept term. \n\nAlternatively, the model could be:\n\nUtility = \u03b3 * split_self - \u03b1 * max{(fair_self - split_self), 0} \n\nWhere \u03b3 is a parameter scaling the importance of the absolute amount. If \u03b3 is 1, then it's the same as before. But allowing \u03b3 to be learned could capture how much participants value the absolute amount versus the fairness. \n\nBut introducing \u03b3 and \u03b1 might complicate parameter recovery. However, with 36 trials per participant, it's possible to estimate two parameters. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the model should include a term for the ratio of split_self to fair_self. For example, split_self / fair_self. If that's greater than 1, it's advantageous. But using ratios can introduce nonlinearities. \n\nAlternatively, the utility could be a linear combination of split_self and the difference from fair_self. \n\nBut given the problem's constraints, the model needs to be simple enough for parameter recovery but capture the essential aspects. \n\nAnother consideration is the combined_earning. Since combined_earning is fixed per trial (3*(token_self + token_opp)), and split_self + split_opp = combined_earning, perhaps the opponent's split is not directly needed, as it's determined once split_self is known. \n\nSo, focusing on split_self and fair_self (3*token_self). \n\nPutting this together, the utility function could be:\n\nUtility = \u03b8 * split_self - \u03b1 * max{(3*token_self - split_self), 0} \n\nHere, \u03b8 represents the marginal utility of money (how much each pound increases utility), and \u03b1 represents the penalty for receiving less than the fair share. Both parameters must be positive. \n\nThe probability of accepting is then logistic(Utility). \n\nBut \u03b8 and \u03b1 might be difficult to disentangle. For example, if \u03b8 is high, even a small split_self could be acceptable if \u03b1 is low. Alternatively, \u03b8 could be fixed to 1, assuming linear utility for money, and only \u03b1 is learned. But the problem allows for learnable parameters, so perhaps both \u03b8 and \u03b1 are learnable. \n\nHowever, to ensure parameter identifiability, perhaps \u03b8 should be fixed. For example, setting \u03b8=1, so Utility = split_self - \u03b1 * max{(fair_self - split_self), 0}. This reduces the model to one parameter, \u03b1, which is the penalty for unfairness. \n\nBut the problem states that the model should have parameters that can be recovered, so maybe two parameters are manageable. \n\nAlternatively, another approach is to model the utility as the difference between the proposed split and the fair split, scaled by a parameter. For example:\n\n\u0394 = split_self - fair_self\nUtility = \u03b1 * \u0394 + \u03b2 * split_self \n\nBut this combines the difference and the absolute amount. However, this might lead to parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 that are hard to distinguish. For instance, if \u03b1 and \u03b2 are both positive, they both contribute positively to Utility. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the model should use a reference point. The reference point is the fair_self, and the utility is the difference from this reference, plus a term for the absolute value. \n\nBut I need to think about what makes the parameters identifiable. For example, if the model is Utility = (split_self - fair_self) + \u03b2 * split_self, then it's equivalent to Utility = (1 + \u03b2) * split_self - fair_self. This is a linear combination, but the parameters might not be uniquely identifiable because they combine into a single coefficient for split_self. \n\nAlternatively, using a non-linear function. For example, a sigmoid function to model diminishing returns on the split_self. But the problem states to use saturating functions where appropriate. \n\nWait, the instructions mention using saturating functions or normalized terms to aid parameter identifiability. So perhaps the split_self is normalized by the combined_earning, or the fair_self. \n\nAlternatively, the utility could be modeled as:\n\nUtility = (split_self / fair_self - 1) * \u03b1 + \u03b2 * (split_self / combined_earning)\n\nHere, the first term captures the proportional difference from the fair share, scaled by \u03b1. The second term is the proportion of the total earnings offered to the participant, scaled by \u03b2. \n\nBut this introduces two parameters. However, if combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), and fair_self is 3*token_self, then split_self / fair_self is split_self/(3*token_self), and split_self / combined_earning is split_self/(3*(token_self + token_opp)). \n\nBut this might complicate the model. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the fair_self is 3*token_self, and the total is 3*(token_self + token_opp), the fair percentage is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The proposed percentage is splitperc_self. So the difference in percentages could be a factor. \n\nSo, the utility could be:\n\nUtility = \u03b1 * (splitperc_self - fair_perc) + \u03b2 * split_self \n\nWhere fair_perc is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. \n\nBut split_self is in pounds, and splitperc_self is a percentage. These are different scales. To combine them, perhaps they need to be normalized. \n\nAlternatively, split_self can be divided by combined_earning to get the same as splitperc_self / 100. So split_self = (splitperc_self / 100) * combined_earning. \n\nBut this might mean that split_self and splitperc_self are collinear. So including both might not add value. \n\nGiven that, perhaps using splitperc_self and fair_perc is sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, the utility could be based on the difference between the proposed percentage and the fair percentage, scaled by a parameter, plus the proposed percentage itself. \n\nBut this might not capture the absolute amount. For example, a 50% split of a large total is more money than a 50% split of a small total. \n\nAlternatively, the utility could have a term for the proposed amount (split_self) and a term for the unfairness (split_self - fair_self). \n\nBut split_self - fair_self is the same as (split_self - 3*token_self). \n\nSo, Utility = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (split_self - 3*token_self)\n\nThis simplifies to Utility = (\u03b1 + \u03b2) * split_self - \u03b2 * 3 * token_self. \n\nBut this is a linear model with two parameters, but they might not be identifiable because they combine into coefficients for split_self and token_self. \n\nAlternatively, if we fix \u03b1=1, then Utility = split_self + \u03b2*(split_self - 3*token_self). This would be equivalent to (1 + \u03b2) * split_self - \u03b2*3*token_self. \n\nBut again, this may not be the best approach. \n\nAnother angle: participants might have a threshold of what's acceptable. The threshold could be a combination of their fair share and some additional amount. For example, they might accept if split_self >= \u03bb * fair_self, where \u03bb is a parameter between 0 and some upper bound. \n\nBut this is a deterministic model. To make it probabilistic, the utility could be the difference between split_self and \u03bb * fair_self, with noise. \n\nSo, Utility = split_self - \u03bb * fair_self + \u03b5, where \u03b5 is a noise term. The probability of accepting is then P(accept) = logistic(Utility / \u03c3), where \u03c3 is the noise scale. But \u03c3 can be fixed (e.g., 1) for identifiability. \n\nIn this case, \u03bb is the learnable parameter. If \u03bb=1, the threshold is the fair share. If \u03bb <1, the participant is willing to accept less than fair; if \u03bb>1, they demand more. \n\nThis model has one parameter, \u03bb, which is bounded (e.g., between 0 and 2). The utility is split_self - \u03bb * fair_self. \n\nBut this model assumes that the utility is linear in split_self and fair_self. However, participants might have nonlinear utility for money. But given the need for simplicity, this might be acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, the model could use a ratio: split_self / fair_self. If this ratio is greater than \u03bb, accept. But again, this would be a threshold model. \n\nBut to make it probabilistic, the utility could be the ratio minus \u03bb, scaled by a parameter. \n\nUtility = \u03b1 * (split_self / fair_self - \u03bb) \n\nHere, \u03b1 is a sensitivity parameter. If the ratio is greater than \u03bb, utility is positive. \n\nBut this introduces two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03bb. \n\nAlternatively, combining both the absolute and relative terms. \n\nBut perhaps the simplest model that captures the key aspects is the one where utility is the difference between the proposed split and a scaled fair share. \n\nSo, Utility = split_self - \u03bb * fair_self \n\nHere, \u03bb is a learnable parameter. If \u03bb=1, the fair share is the threshold. If \u03bb=0.8, the participant accepts even if they get 80% of their fair share. \n\nThe probability of accepting is then logistic(Utility). \n\nBut this model has only one parameter, \u03bb. However, the problem allows for multiple parameters. \n\nBut maybe participants also have a baseline tendency to accept or reject, independent of the split. So adding an intercept term. \n\nUtility = \u03b2_0 + split_self - \u03bb * fair_self \n\nHere, \u03b2_0 is a bias term. If \u03b2_0 is positive, the participant is more likely to accept even if split_self is less than \u03bb*fair_self. \n\nBut this introduces two parameters, \u03b2_0 and \u03bb. \n\nHowever, with 36 trials per participant, two parameters might be feasible. \n\nBut the problem states that the model should pass parameter recovery tests, so the parameters need to be identifiable. \n\nAnother consideration is that the split_self and fair_self (3*token_self) are in the same units (\u00a3), so combining them directly is feasible. \n\nSo, the model could be:\n\nUtility = \u03b2_0 + \u03b2_split * split_self + \u03b2_fair * (split_self - fair_self) \n\nBut this is equivalent to:\n\nUtility = \u03b2_0 + (\u03b2_split + \u03b2_fair) * split_self - \u03b2_fair * fair_self \n\nWhich again combines parameters in a way that might make them hard to identify. \n\nAlternatively, to separate the effects, perhaps:\n\nUtility = \u03b2_split * split_self + \u03b2_fair * (split_self / fair_self - 1) \n\nHere, \u03b2_split captures the utility from the absolute amount, and \u03b2_fair captures the utility from the proportional deviation from fair. \n\nBut this introduces two parameters. \n\nAlternatively, using a single parameter that combines both effects. \n\nBut perhaps the most parsimonious model is the one with a single parameter \u03bb, representing the trade-off between the proposed split and the fair share. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the utility could be a weighted sum of the proposed split and the fair share. \n\nUtility = \u03b1 * split_self + (1 - \u03b1) * fair_self \n\nBut this would require \u03b1 to be between 0 and 1, and the utility would be a convex combination. However, this might not capture the trade-off correctly. \n\nAlternatively, the model could use the difference between split_self and fair_self, scaled by a parameter. \n\nUtility = \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_self) \n\nHere, \u03b1 is a sensitivity parameter. If \u03b1 is positive, higher split_self than fair_self increases utility. \n\nBut this ignores the absolute value of split_self. For example, if two offers have the same difference (split_self - fair_self), but one has a higher split_self, the utility would be the same. But in reality, a higher split_self might be more acceptable even if the difference is the same. \n\nHmm. This is a problem. For example, suppose fair_self is \u00a310. Offer A is \u00a312 (difference +\u00a32), Offer B is \u00a315 (difference +\u00a35). If \u03b1 is positive, Offer B has higher utility. But if another offer has fair_self \u00a320, and split_self \u00a322 (difference +\u00a32), same difference as Offer A, but higher absolute. The utility would be the same if only the difference is considered. But participants might prefer \u00a322 over \u00a312 even if the difference is the same. \n\nThus, the model should include both the difference and the absolute term. But this brings us back to the earlier problem of parameter identifiability. \n\nAlternatively, the model could use the ratio of split_self to fair_self. \n\nUtility = \u03b1 * (split_self / fair_self - 1) \n\nThis represents the proportional gain over the fair share. If split_self is equal to fair_self, utility is 0. If it's higher, positive; lower, negative. \n\nBut this doesn't account for the absolute amount. For example, a 10% increase over fair_self when fair_self is \u00a310 gives \u00a311, but when fair_self is \u00a320 gives \u00a322. The utility would be the same (0.1 * \u03b1), but the absolute gains are different. Participants might value the absolute gain more. \n\nThis suggests that the model should include both proportional and absolute terms, but again, this complicates parameter recovery. \n\nGiven the constraints of the problem and the need for parameter recovery, perhaps the best approach is to use a model with two parameters: one for the sensitivity to the difference from the fair share, and another for the sensitivity to the absolute split. \n\nSo, the utility function could be:\n\nUtility = \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_self) + \u03b2 * split_self \n\nSimplifying, this becomes:\n\nUtility = (\u03b1 + \u03b2) * split_self - \u03b1 * fair_self \n\nBut this combines \u03b1 and \u03b2 into a coefficient for split_self. To make the parameters identifiable, perhaps we can reparameterize. For example, let \u03b3 = \u03b1 + \u03b2 and \u03b4 = \u03b1. Then, Utility = \u03b3 * split_self - \u03b4 * fair_self. But this doesn't solve the identifiability issue because \u03b3 and \u03b4 are combinations of \u03b1 and \u03b2. \n\nAlternatively, if we fix one parameter. For example, set \u03b2=1, so Utility = split_self + \u03b1*(split_self - fair_self). This becomes Utility = (1 + \u03b1) * split_self - \u03b1 * fair_self. \n\nBut this still has two parameters. Wait, no\u2014if \u03b2 is fixed to 1, then \u03b1 is the only learnable parameter. \n\nAlternatively, the model could be:\n\nUtility = split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_self) \n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nUtility = (1 + \u03b1) * split_self - \u03b1 * fair_self \n\nHere, \u03b1 is a learnable parameter that determines how much the difference from the fair share matters relative to the absolute split. If \u03b1 is positive, the participant places more weight on the difference (i.e., fairness). If \u03b1 is zero, only the absolute split matters. \n\nThis model has one learnable parameter, \u03b1, which can be bounded between, say, -1 and 1 to prevent extreme values. But this might not be necessary; the bounds can be generous. \n\nHowever, this model assumes that the utility is linear in both split_self and the difference. But perhaps participants have diminishing sensitivity. For example, the difference might matter more when it's a loss (split_self < fair_self) than when it's a gain. \n\nTo capture this, we can split the difference into loss and gain components. \n\nUtility = split_self + \u03b1 * max(fair_self - split_self, 0) + \u03b2 * max(split_self - fair_self, 0) \n\nHere, \u03b1 represents the penalty for being below the fair share, and \u03b2 represents the reward for being above. If \u03b1 and \u03b2 are different, it allows for asymmetric sensitivity. \n\nBut this introduces two parameters. However, with 36 trials, estimating two parameters might be feasible. \n\nBut the problem states that the model should prioritize parameter recovery. To ensure identifiability, perhaps we can set \u03b2=0, assuming that participants only penalize offers below the fair share and don't reward offers above. \n\nSo, Utility = split_self + \u03b1 * max(fair_self - split_self, 0) \n\nWait, no. If \u03b1 is positive, then when split_self < fair_self, the utility decreases. So the model becomes:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b1 * (fair_self - split_self) \n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nUtility = (1 + \u03b1) * split_self - \u03b1 * fair_self \n\nBut this is similar to the previous model. \n\nAlternatively, if \u03b1 is a penalty parameter, the utility could be:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_self - split_self, 0) \n\nThis way, when the offer is below fair, the utility is reduced by \u03b1 times the deficit. If the offer is above fair, the utility is just split_self. \n\nThis model has one parameter, \u03b1, which must be non-negative. \n\nThis seems plausible. For example, if \u03b1=0, the participant only cares about the absolute split_self. If \u03b1>0, they penalize offers below their fair share. \n\nThe probability of accepting is then logistic(Utility). \n\nBut in this model, even if the offer is below fair, if split_self is high enough, the utility could still be positive. For example, fair_self=10, split_self=8, \u03b1=1. Utility=8 -1*(2)=6. So P(accept)=logistic(6)\u22481. But if split_self=5, \u03b1=1, utility=5-5=0 \u2192 P=0.5. \n\nWait, that's not right. If split_self=5, fair_self=10, then max(fair_self - split_self,0)=5. So utility=5 - \u03b1*5. If \u03b1=1, utility=0. So P=0.5. If \u03b1=2, utility=5-10= -5 \u2192 P\u22480. \n\nThis model implies that when the offer is exactly fair (split_self=10), utility=10. So P\u22481. \n\nBut maybe participants have a different baseline. For example, even if the offer is fair, there's a cost to accepting, or a baseline tendency. \n\nAlternatively, adding an intercept term:\n\nUtility = \u03b2_0 + split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_self - split_self, 0) \n\nHere, \u03b2_0 could capture a general bias to accept (if positive) or reject (if negative). \n\nBut this introduces two parameters. However, with 36 trials, this might be manageable. \n\nBut the problem states that the model should predict utility where less than 0 corresponds to less than 50% probability. So the intercept term could be part of the utility. \n\nBut how to ensure that the parameters are identifiable. For example, if \u03b2_0 is positive, it could offset a negative utility from the split. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intercept is not necessary, and the model can rely solely on the split_self and fairness term. \n\nAnother consideration is the participant's own contribution (token_self). The fair_self is 3*token_self, so perhaps participants with higher token_self have higher fair_self, and thus higher expectations. \n\nBut the model already incorporates fair_self as 3*token_self, so that's accounted for. \n\nPutting this all together, the model that includes both the absolute split and the penalty for being below fair_self with one parameter seems plausible. \n\nBut to also account for the possibility that participants might have different sensitivities to the absolute amount, perhaps the model should include a scaling parameter for split_self. \n\nSo:\n\nUtility = \u03b3 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_self - split_self, 0) \n\nHere, \u03b3 scales the utility from the absolute split, and \u03b1 is the penalty for being below fair. Both parameters are positive. \n\nThis model has two parameters. However, \u03b3 and \u03b1 might be difficult to recover if they are correlated. For example, a high \u03b3 and high \u03b1 could lead to similar behavior as a low \u03b3 and low \u03b1. \n\nTo address this, perhaps \u03b3 can be fixed to 1, assuming linear utility for money. Then the model becomes:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_self - split_self, 0) \n\nThis reduces the model to one parameter, \u03b1, which is the penalty for unfairness. \n\nThis is a simpler model and likely more identifiable. \n\nTesting this model: if \u03b1=0, the utility is split_self, so higher offers are more likely to be accepted. If \u03b1>0, offers below fair_self are penalized. \n\nFor example, if fair_self=10, split_self=8, \u03b1=1: utility=8 - 2=6 \u2192 P=logistic(6)\u22481. \n\nWait, that's not right. If split_self=8 is below fair_self=10, then the penalty is 2*\u03b1. So utility=8 - 2*\u03b1. If \u03b1=1, utility=6 \u2192 P\u22481. But if \u03b1=3, utility=8-6=2 \u2192 P\u22480.88. \n\nBut this seems counterintuitive. If the penalty is higher, the utility decreases more for the same deficit. \n\nWait, no. If \u03b1=3, then for split_self=8, utility=8 -3*(10-8)=8-6=2. So higher \u03b1 increases the penalty. \n\nBut in this case, even with \u03b1=3, the utility is still positive, so P>0.5. \n\nBut if split_self=5, fair_self=10, \u03b1=1: utility=5-5=0 \u2192 P=0.5. \n\nIf \u03b1=2: utility=5-10= -5 \u2192 P\u22480. \n\nSo, this model allows \u03b1 to control the sensitivity to unfairness. Higher \u03b1 means participants are less tolerant of offers below fair_self. \n\nThis seems plausible. \n\nBut what if the offer is above fair_self? Then, the penalty term is zero, and utility=split_self. So even if the offer is very generous, the utility is just the split_self. \n\nBut participants might have diminishing marginal utility for money. For example, the difference between \u00a310 and \u00a320 is more significant than between \u00a3110 and \u00a3120. \n\nHowever, given the task's context and the need for simplicity, assuming linear utility for money might be acceptable. \n\nThus, the model would be:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_self - split_self, 0) \n\nWhere \u03b1 is a learnable parameter with a lower bound of 0 (since penalty can't be negative). \n\nThe probability of accepting is logistic(Utility). \n\nThis model has one parameter, \u03b1, which is bounded below by 0. \n\nBut the problem allows for multiple parameters. Maybe adding another parameter, like a sensitivity to the opponent's contribution. \n\nAlternatively, considering the trial_type variable. For example, in trials where the opponent contributed more (trial_type=2), participants might be more lenient. But trial_type is derived from token_self and token_opp, so perhaps it's redundant. \n\nAlternatively, participants might compare their contribution to the opponent's. For example, if they contributed more, they might demand a higher split. But this is already captured in fair_self. \n\nAnother angle: the utility could include a term that accounts for the opponent's proposed share (split_opp). But since split_opp = combined_earning - split_self, it's redundant. \n\nAlternatively, participants might care about the ratio of their split to the opponent's split. For example, split_self / split_opp. But this ratio can be expressed in terms of split_self and combined_earning. \n\nBut this complicates the model. \n\nGiven the time constraints and the need for a model that balances accuracy and parameter recovery, the single-parameter model seems appropriate. \n\nHowever, the problem statement mentions that the model should utilize the given variables appropriately but not necessarily all. So, using split_self and token_self (to compute fair_self) is acceptable. \n\nThus, the final model is:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_self - split_self, 0) \n\nWhere fair_self = 3 * token_self. \n\nThis model uses split_self and token_self from the dataset. \n\nThe parameter \u03b1 has a lower bound of 0 (inclusive) and an upper bound that can be set generously, say 10. \n\nThe target variable is 'accept', which is binary. The probability of accept is 1 / (1 + exp(-Utility)). \n\nThis model should satisfy the requirements: it predicts responder behavior, uses relevant variables, has a learnable parameter with bounds, and the utility can be negative (leading to P<0.5). \n\nNow, to write this formally in mathematical notation. \n\nThe fair_self is 3 * token_self. \n\nThe utility is:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b1 * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0) \n\nThis can be written as:\n\nU = s_self - \u03b1 * max(3 * t_self - s_self, 0) \n\nWhere s_self is split_self and t_self is token_self. \n\nThe probability of acceptance is logistic(U). \n\nNow, the variables in the model are:\n\n- s_self (split_self): from data\n- t_self (token_self): from data\n- \u03b1: learnable parameter, >=0\n\nSo, the model in <MODEL> tags would be:\n\nU = split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nBut in mathematical notation, using LaTeX-style symbols:\n\nU = \\text{split\\_self} - \\alpha \\cdot \\max(3 \\cdot \\text{token\\_self} - \\text{split\\_self}, 0)\n\nBut since the model must be enclosed in <MODEL> tags and use variable names as per the dataset, perhaps using the actual variable names. \n\nWait, the variables in the dataset are named as split_self and token_self. So the model can directly reference these. \n\nThus, the model is:\n\n<MODEL>\nutility = split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n</MODEL>\n\nThe variable alpha is a learnable parameter with a min of 0 and a reasonable max, say 10. \n\nThe variables section would then describe alpha, split_self, token_self, and utility. \n\nThe target variable is 'accept', which is predicted via the logistic function applied to utility. \n\nNow, the variable descriptions:\n\n- split_self: from data, type float64.\n- token_self: from data, type int64.\n- alpha: learnable parameter, range [0, 10], inclusive.\n- utility: calculated variable.\n\nThe utility is unbounded, as it can go from negative infinity (if split_self is very low and alpha is high) to positive infinity (if split_self is very high). \n\nThus, the JSON structure would be:\n\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity parameter for penalty when split_self is below fair share (3 * token_self)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"utility\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposal\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThe summary should describe the model concisely. \n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model where acceptance probability depends on the proposed amount and a penalty for offers below the participant's fair share (3 * token_self).

So the model can directly reference these. \n\nThus, the model is:\n\n<MODEL>\nutility = split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\nSummary: A utility model where acceptance probability depends on the proposed amount and a penalty for offers below the participant's fair share (3 * token_self). The penalty is scaled by a learnable sensitivity parameter (alpha). Higher alpha increases rejection likelihood for unfair offers, while higher split_self increases acceptance likelihood.\nTarget Variable: accept\nPrediction Type: utility\nBIC: 152.3750124280904\nOverall Accuracy: 0.8349\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.986"
