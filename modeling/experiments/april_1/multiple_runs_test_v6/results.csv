U = split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)

But in mathematical notation, using LaTeX-style symbols:

U = \text{split\_self} - \alpha \cdot \max(3 \cdot \text{token\_self} - \text{split\_self}, 0)

But since the model must be enclosed in <MODEL> tags and use variable names as per the dataset, perhaps using the actual variable names. 

Wait, the variables in the dataset are named as split_self and token_self. So the model can directly reference these. 

Thus, the model is:

<MODEL>
utility = split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)","A utility model where acceptance probability depends on the proposed amount and a penalty for offers below the participant's fair share (3 * token_self). The penalty is scaled by a learnable sensitivity parameter (alpha). Higher alpha increases rejection likelihood for unfair offers, while higher split_self increases acceptance likelihood.",v6,"

Focus on mathematical implementations that inherently minimize parameter covariance through constrained interactions. Prioritize parameter identifiability by:  
1. Using saturating functions (e.g., sigmoids) or normalized terms where appropriate  
2. Explicitly testing whether each parameter produces unique behavioral signatures via synthetic data checks  
3. Implementing parameter transformations (e.g., softplus for bounds) rather than raw free parameters  

Maintain maximum parsimony while ensuring:  
- Critical cognitive operations (e.g., value updating, choice competition) are explicitly represented as separable computational modules  
- Each parameter governs exactly one psychologically distinct process  
- Dynamic interactions between mechanisms are mediated through observable trial-level variables rather than hidden states  

Include validation steps where intermediate model outputs (e.g., trial-wise likelihoods) are compared to empirical choice distributions before final parameter estimation.",0.9857112387976269
1,155.13493815216663,,,0.8400488400488401,U = split_self + alpha * (split_self - 3 * token_self),"A utility model combining absolute offer value and deviation from contribution-based fairness. The utility increases with the proposed amount (split_self) and is adjusted by a learnable parameter (Î±) scaling the difference between the offer and the participant's fair share (3 * token_self). The model predicts acceptance probability via logistic transformation of the utility, capturing sensitivity to both absolute gains and fairness relative to contribution.",v6,"Be VERY considerate of high covariance between learnable parameters as the model. Have an appropriate number or learnable parameters, with a slight bias for less learnable paramters.

First, reason step by step about:
* The key psychological mechanisms involved
* How these mechanisms interact
* What mathematical form could capture these interactions
* What parameters would be needed to calibrate the model
* How the model variables map to observable behavior",0.899152539010826
