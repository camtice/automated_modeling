Okay, let's look at the previous results. The BIC was 216.29, which is okay, but maybe we can lower it. The accuracy was 73.2%, which is decent but could be better. The parameter recovery for alpha was 0.67, which is moderate, but beta was only 0.218, which is quite low. That suggests that the beta parameter isn't being recovered well, meaning the model might not be capturing the disadvantageous inequality effect properly.

Hmm, why is beta's recovery so low? Maybe the model's structure isn't capturing the psychological mechanisms accurately. The current model uses a proportional disadvantageous term, but perhaps participants are more sensitive to absolute differences rather than proportional ones. Or maybe the way the fair share is calculated (3*token_self) isn't the right reference point. Alternatively, there might be other factors influencing the decision, like the opponent's share or the total combined earnings.

The previous instructions told the model to focus on fewer parameters and avoid covariance. The current model has two parameters, which is good, but if they're correlated, that could hurt recovery. The low recovery for beta might indicate that it's not well-identified in the model. Maybe the model needs to adjust how the fairness term is calculated to better separate the effects of alpha and beta.

Also, the note mentioned that two equal split_self values don't represent the same fairness because combined_earning varies. The current model uses split_self relative to 3*token_self, which is part of the combined_earning. But maybe participants consider the split relative to the total (combined_earning) instead of their own contribution. For example, a 50% split might be seen as fair regardless of contributions. That could change the reference point.

Alternatively, the model could include both absolute and relative terms. For instance, split_self compared to the equal split (combined_earning/2) and their own contribution. But that would add more parameters. However, the previous run had two parameters, so adding another might not be ideal. But if it improves recovery and accuracy, it could be worth considering.

Wait, the problem states that the model should predict responder behavior (accept/reject). The current model uses split_self and token_self. Maybe including split_opp or the opponent's contribution (token_opp) could help. For example, participants might compare their split to the opponent's split. If the opponent is getting more, that could influence rejection.

But the current model doesn't consider the opponent's share. Including split_opp or token_opp might add another dimension. For example, the utility could have a term comparing split_self to split_opp. But that might introduce another parameter. However, if the opponent's share is important, the model is missing that.

Another angle: the current model uses max((3*token_self - split_self)/(3*token_self), 0). Maybe participants have a different reference point, like the equal split (combined_earning/2). So split_self compared to combined_earning/2. That way, even if their contribution is low, a 50% split is considered fair. This might better capture fairness perceptions independent of contribution, which could improve parameter recovery.

Changing the reference point to combined_earning/2 would make the fairness term (split_self - combined_earning/2). But combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So the model would compare split_self to 1.5*(token_self + token_opp). This is a different notion of fairness, possibly leading to better parameter separation.

Alternatively, use both contribution-based and equal-split-based fairness terms. But that would add more parameters. However, given the low recovery of beta, maybe adjusting the fairness term's calculation is necessary.

Another possibility is that the model's utility function leads to high covariance between alpha and beta. For example, in the current model, U = alpha*split_self - beta*max(...). If split_self is highly correlated with the max term, alpha and beta might be confounded. To reduce covariance, the model could use orthogonal terms. For instance, if the fairness term is split_self / combined_earning (a percentage), while the self-interest term is split_self in absolute terms. That way, the two terms are less correlated, improving parameter recovery.

Alternatively, the model could use a non-linear interaction between split_self and the fairness term. But that complicates the model. Instead, ensuring that the two terms (self-interest and fairness) are not linearly dependent could help.

Also, the current model's beta has a range up to 10, but maybe the data doesn't require such a high upper bound. If the true beta values are lower, the optimization might struggle within a large range. Narrowing the bounds based on previous estimates could help, but without knowing the true values, it's tricky. However, the initial bounds were [0,10], which is generous.

Another thought: the model converts utility to probability via logistic function. If the utility's scale is too large or small, the logistic might saturate, making parameter estimation harder. Standardizing the input variables (like split_self and token_self) could help, but the instructions say to use the variables as provided. Alternatively, scaling parameters appropriately.

Wait, in the current model, split_self is in £, which could vary widely. For example, if split_self ranges from 0 to 30, and alpha is between 0-10, then alpha*split_self could be up to 300. The fairness term is a proportion, so beta*max(...) is up to 10*1=10. So the utility is dominated by the alpha term, making beta's effect relatively small. That could explain poor recovery of beta. If the utility is dominated by alpha, beta's influence is minimal, leading to poor recovery.

To address this, perhaps normalize the split_self term. For example, divide split_self by combined_earning to make it a percentage. Then, alpha would represent sensitivity to percentage share. This would put both terms on a similar scale, allowing beta to have a more comparable effect. For example:

U = alpha*(split_self / combined_earning) - beta*max( (fair_self - split_self)/fair_self, 0 )

But combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so split_self / combined_earning is the percentage of the total. This might balance the scales between alpha and beta terms, reducing covariance and improving parameter recovery.

Alternatively, use split_self in £ but scale alpha down by a factor (e.g., alpha/10) to prevent it from dominating. But that's arbitrary. Instead, using relative terms could naturally balance the parameters.

So, revising the model to use split_self as a percentage of combined_earning might help. Let's adjust the model:

U = alpha*(split_self / combined_earning) - beta*max( (fair_self - split_self)/fair_self, 0 )

But combined_earning is available in the dataset, so this is feasible. This change would make alpha and beta operate on similar scales (both are unitless), potentially reducing covariance and improving beta's recovery.

Additionally, the model could include an intercept term to account for baseline acceptance probability. For example, U = alpha*(split_self / CE) + gamma - beta*max(...). But adding another parameter (gamma) might increase model complexity, affecting BIC. However, if the intercept improves fit significantly, it could be worth it despite the BIC penalty.

But the previous instructions advised fewer parameters. Since the current model has two, adding a third might not be ideal. Instead, adjusting the existing terms to better capture the effects without adding parameters is preferable.

In summary, the key issues from the previous run are low beta recovery and possibly high covariance between alpha and beta. To address this, the new instructions should guide the model to:

1. Adjust the fairness term to a different reference point (e.g., equal split instead of contribution-based) to reduce covariance.
2. Consider scaling variables (e.g., using percentages) to balance parameter effects.
3. Explore including opponent-related variables (split_opp or token_opp) if they add explanatory power without excessive parameters.
4. Ensure parameters are orthogonal in their effects to improve recovery.
5. Possibly introduce non-linear terms if they capture necessary psychological mechanisms.

The new instructions should encourage models that better separate the effects of alpha and beta, possibly by changing how fairness is operationalized, using normalized terms, or including additional relevant variables that don't overly complicate the model.

Focus on improving parameter identifiability by reducing covariance between parameters. Consider these enhancements:

1. **Introduce orthogonal utility components** - Ensure self-interest and fairness terms operate on different scales (e.g., absolute vs normalized measures) to reduce correlation between α and β

2. **Expand fairness computation** - Explore alternative reference points beyond contribution-based fairness (e.g., equal splits, opponent comparisons) that may better match human behavior patterns

3. **Add nonlinear transformations** - Consider sigmoidal terms or threshold effects for inequality sensitivity that might better capture rejection patterns

4. **Incorporate trial-type interactions** - Allow different sensitivity parameters for different trial_type categories while maintaining parsimony through shared components

5. **Implement adaptive scaling** - Automatically normalize monetary amounts by combined_earning to prevent parameter magnitude mismatches

Prioritize models with 2-3 parameters that demonstrate <0.5 cross-correlation in synthetic recovery tests. Emphasize psychological plausibility of different inequality aversion mechanisms through explicit comparison operators in utility functions.
