  "instructions": "<think>\nOkay, let's look at the previous results. The BIC was 216.29, which is okay, but maybe we can lower it. The accuracy was 73.2%, which is decent but could be better. The parameter recovery for alpha was 0.67, which is moderate, but beta was only 0.218, which is quite low. That suggests that the beta parameter isn't being recovered well, meaning the model might not be capturing the disadvantageous inequality effect properly.\n\nHmm, why is beta's recovery so low? Maybe the model's structure isn't capturing the psychological mechanisms accurately. The current model uses a proportional disadvantageous term, but perhaps participants are more sensitive to absolute differences rather than proportional ones. Or maybe the way the fair share is calculated (3*token_self) isn't the right reference point. Alternatively, there might be other factors influencing the decision, like the opponent's share or the total combined earnings.\n\nThe previous instructions told the model to focus on fewer parameters and avoid covariance. The current model has two parameters, which is good, but if they're correlated, that could hurt recovery. The low recovery for beta might indicate that it's not well-identified in the model. Maybe the model needs to adjust how the fairness term is calculated to better separate the effects of alpha and beta.\n\nAlso, the note mentioned that two equal split_self values don't represent the same fairness because combined_earning varies. The current model uses split_self relative to 3*token_self, which is part of the combined_earning. But maybe participants consider the split relative to the total (combined_earning) instead of their own contribution. For example, a 50% split might be seen as fair regardless of contributions. That could change the reference point.\n\nAlternatively, the model could include both absolute and relative terms. For instance, split_self compared to the equal split (combined_earning/2) and their own contribution. But that would add more parameters. However, the previous run had two parameters, so adding another might not be ideal. But if it improves recovery and accuracy, it could be worth considering.\n\nWait, the problem states that the model should predict responder behavior (accept/reject). The current model uses split_self and token_self. Maybe including split_opp or the opponent's contribution (token_opp) could help. For example, participants might compare their split to the opponent's split. If the opponent is getting more, that could influence rejection.\n\nBut the current model doesn't consider the opponent's share. Including split_opp or token_opp might add another dimension. For example, the utility could have a term comparing split_self to split_opp. But that might introduce another parameter. However, if the opponent's share is important, the model is missing that.\n\nAnother angle: the current model uses max((3*token_self - split_self)/(3*token_self), 0). Maybe participants have a different reference point, like the equal split (combined_earning/2). So split_self compared to combined_earning/2. That way, even if their contribution is low, a 50% split is considered fair. This might better capture fairness perceptions independent of contribution, which could improve parameter recovery.\n\nChanging the reference point to combined_earning/2 would make the fairness term (split_self - combined_earning/2). But combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So the model would compare split_self to 1.5*(token_self + token_opp). This is a different notion of fairness, possibly leading to better parameter separation.\n\nAlternatively, use both contribution-based and equal-split-based fairness terms. But that would add more parameters. However, given the low recovery of beta, maybe adjusting the fairness term's calculation is necessary.\n\nAnother possibility is that the model's utility function leads to high covariance between alpha and beta. For example, in the current model, U = alpha*split_self - beta*max(...). If split_self is highly correlated with the max term, alpha and beta might be confounded. To reduce covariance, the model could use orthogonal terms. For instance, if the fairness term is split_self / combined_earning (a percentage), while the self-interest term is split_self in absolute terms. That way, the two terms are less correlated, improving parameter recovery.\n\nAlternatively, the model could use a non-linear interaction between split_self and the fairness term. But that complicates the model. Instead, ensuring that the two terms (self-interest and fairness) are not linearly dependent could help.\n\nAlso, the current model's beta has a range up to 10, but maybe the data doesn't require such a high upper bound. If the true beta values are lower, the optimization might struggle within a large range. Narrowing the bounds based on previous estimates could help, but without knowing the true values, it's tricky. However, the initial bounds were [0,10], which is generous.\n\nAnother thought: the model converts utility to probability via logistic function. If the utility's scale is too large or small, the logistic might saturate, making parameter estimation harder. Standardizing the input variables (like split_self and token_self) could help, but the instructions say to use the variables as provided. Alternatively, scaling parameters appropriately.\n\nWait, in the current model, split_self is in \u00a3, which could vary widely. For example, if split_self ranges from 0 to 30, and alpha is between 0-10, then alpha*split_self could be up to 300. The fairness term is a proportion, so beta*max(...) is up to 10*1=10. So the utility is dominated by the alpha term, making beta's effect relatively small. That could explain poor recovery of beta. If the utility is dominated by alpha, beta's influence is minimal, leading to poor recovery.\n\nTo address this, perhaps normalize the split_self term. For example, divide split_self by combined_earning to make it a percentage. Then, alpha would represent sensitivity to percentage share. This would put both terms on a similar scale, allowing beta to have a more comparable effect. For example:\n\nU = alpha*(split_self / combined_earning) - beta*max( (fair_self - split_self)/fair_self, 0 )\n\nBut combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so split_self / combined_earning is the percentage of the total. This might balance the scales between alpha and beta terms, reducing covariance and improving parameter recovery.\n\nAlternatively, use split_self in \u00a3 but scale alpha down by a factor (e.g., alpha/10) to prevent it from dominating. But that's arbitrary. Instead, using relative terms could naturally balance the parameters.\n\nSo, revising the model to use split_self as a percentage of combined_earning might help. Let's adjust the model:\n\nU = alpha*(split_self / combined_earning) - beta*max( (fair_self - split_self)/fair_self, 0 )\n\nBut combined_earning is available in the dataset, so this is feasible. This change would make alpha and beta operate on similar scales (both are unitless), potentially reducing covariance and improving beta's recovery.\n\nAdditionally, the model could include an intercept term to account for baseline acceptance probability. For example, U = alpha*(split_self / CE) + gamma - beta*max(...). But adding another parameter (gamma) might increase model complexity, affecting BIC. However, if the intercept improves fit significantly, it could be worth it despite the BIC penalty.\n\nBut the previous instructions advised fewer parameters. Since the current model has two, adding a third might not be ideal. Instead, adjusting the existing terms to better capture the effects without adding parameters is preferable.\n\nIn summary, the key issues from the previous run are low beta recovery and possibly high covariance between alpha and beta. To address this, the new instructions should guide the model to:\n\n1. Adjust the fairness term to a different reference point (e.g., equal split instead of contribution-based) to reduce covariance.\n2. Consider scaling variables (e.g., using percentages) to balance parameter effects.\n3. Explore including opponent-related variables (split_opp or token_opp) if they add explanatory power without excessive parameters.\n4. Ensure parameters are orthogonal in their effects to improve recovery.\n5. Possibly introduce non-linear terms if they capture necessary psychological mechanisms.\n\nThe new instructions should encourage models that better separate the effects of alpha and beta, possibly by changing how fairness is operationalized, using normalized terms, or including additional relevant variables that don't overly complicate the model.\n</think>\n\nFocus on improving parameter identifiability by reducing covariance between parameters. Consider these enhancements:\n\n1. **Introduce orthogonal utility components** - Ensure self-interest and fairness terms operate on different scales (e.g., absolute vs normalized measures) to reduce correlation between \u03b1 and \u03b2\n\n2. **Expand fairness computation** - Explore alternative reference points beyond contribution-based fairness (e.g., equal splits, opponent comparisons) that may better match human behavior patterns\n\n3. **Add nonlinear transformations** - Consider sigmoidal terms or threshold effects for inequality sensitivity that might better capture rejection patterns\n\n4. **Incorporate trial-type interactions** - Allow different sensitivity parameters for different trial_type categories while maintaining parsimony through shared components\n\n5. **Implement adaptive scaling** - Automatically normalize monetary amounts by combined_earning to prevent parameter magnitude mismatches\n\nPrioritize models with 2-3 parameters that demonstrate <0.5 cross-correlation in synthetic recovery tests. Emphasize psychological plausibility of different inequality aversion mechanisms through explicit comparison operators in utility functions.",

Instead, ensuring that the two terms (self-interest and fairness) are not linearly dependent could help.\n\nAlso, the current model's beta has a range up to 10, but maybe the data doesn't require such a high upper bound. If the true beta values are lower, the optimization might struggle within a large range. Narrowing the bounds based on previous estimates could help, but without knowing the true values, it's tricky. However, the initial bounds were [0,10], which is generous.\n\nAnother thought: the model converts utility to probability via logistic function. If the utility's scale is too large or small, the logistic might saturate, making parameter estimation harder. Standardizing the input variables (like split_self and token_self) could help, but the instructions say to use the variables as provided. Alternatively, scaling parameters appropriately.\n\nWait, in the current model, split_self is in \u00a3, which could vary widely. For example, if split_self ranges from 0 to 30, and alpha is between 0-10, then alpha*split_self could be up to 300. The fairness term is a proportion, so beta*max(...) is up to 10*1=10. So the utility is dominated by the alpha term, making beta's effect relatively small. That could explain poor recovery of beta. If the utility is dominated by alpha, beta's influence is minimal, leading to poor recovery.\n\nTo address this, perhaps normalize the split_self term. For example, divide split_self by combined_earning to make it a percentage. Then, alpha would represent sensitivity to percentage share. This would put both terms on a similar scale, allowing beta to have a more comparable effect. For example:\n\nU = alpha*(split_self / combined_earning) - beta*max( (fair_self - split_self)/fair_self, 0 )\n\nBut combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so split_self / combined_earning is the percentage of the total. This might balance the scales between alpha and beta terms, reducing covariance and improving parameter recovery.\n\nAlternatively, use split_self in \u00a3 but scale alpha down by a factor (e.g., alpha/10) to prevent it from dominating. But that's arbitrary. Instead, using relative terms could naturally balance the parameters.\n\nSo, revising the model to use split_self as a percentage of combined_earning might help. Let's adjust the model:\n\nU = alpha*(split_self / combined_earning) - beta*max( (fair_self - split_self)/fair_self, 0 )\n\nBut combined_earning is available in the dataset, so this is feasible. This change would make alpha and beta operate on similar scales (both are unitless), potentially reducing covariance and improving beta's recovery.\n\nAdditionally, the model could include an intercept term to account for baseline acceptance probability. For example, U = alpha*(split_self / CE) + gamma - beta*max(...). But adding another parameter (gamma) might increase model complexity, affecting BIC. However, if the intercept improves fit significantly, it could be worth it despite the BIC penalty.\n\nBut the previous instructions advised fewer parameters. Since the current model has two, adding a third might not be ideal. Instead, adjusting the existing terms to better capture the effects without adding parameters is preferable.\n\nIn summary, the key issues from the previous run are low beta recovery and possibly high covariance between alpha and beta. To address this, the new instructions should guide the model to:\n\n1. Adjust the fairness term to a different reference point (e.g., equal split instead of contribution-based) to reduce covariance.\n2. Consider scaling variables (e.g., using percentages) to balance parameter effects.\n3. Explore including opponent-related variables (split_opp or token_opp) if they add explanatory power without excessive parameters.\n4. Ensure parameters are orthogonal in their effects to improve recovery.\n5. Possibly introduce non-linear terms if they capture necessary psychological mechanisms.\n\nThe new instructions should encourage models that better separate the effects of alpha and beta, possibly by changing how fairness is operationalized, using normalized terms, or including additional relevant variables that don't overly complicate the model.\n</think>\n\nFocus on improving parameter identifiability by reducing covariance between parameters. Consider these enhancements:\n\n1. **Introduce orthogonal utility components** - Ensure self-interest and fairness terms operate on different scales (e.g., absolute vs normalized measures) to reduce correlation between \u03b1 and \u03b2\n\n2. **Expand fairness computation** - Explore alternative reference points beyond contribution-based fairness (e.g., equal splits, opponent comparisons) that may better match human behavior patterns\n\n3. **Add nonlinear transformations** - Consider sigmoidal terms or threshold effects for inequality sensitivity that might better capture rejection patterns\n\n4. **Incorporate trial-type interactions** - Allow different sensitivity parameters for different trial_type categories while maintaining parsimony through shared components\n\n5. **Implement adaptive scaling** - Automatically normalize monetary amounts by combined_earning to prevent parameter magnitude mismatches\n\nPrioritize models with 2-3 parameters that demonstrate <0.5 cross-correlation in synthetic recovery tests. Emphasize psychological plausibility of different inequality aversion mechanisms through explicit comparison operators in utility functions.\n\nPrevious Models:Not Provided\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions.",
      "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts whether a participant accepts or rejects a proposal, focusing on responder behavior. The model needs to use the provided variables appropriately, ensure parameter recovery, and predict utility which translates to acceptance probability via a logistic function.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key factors influencing a responder's decision. The main variables related to the proposal are split_self (the amount offered to the participant) and split_opp (the opponent's share). But the problem mentions that fairness isn't just about the split percentages because the combined earnings vary. So, the model should account for both the absolute offer and the fairness relative to contributions and total earnings.\n\nThe participant's own contribution is token_self, which translates to \u00a33 per token. Similarly, the opponent's contribution is token_opp. The combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). The split_self is the amount offered to the participant from this total.\n\nFairness could be calculated in different ways. One approach is to compare the offer to what's considered a fair share. A fair share based on contributions would be (3*token_self) since that's what the participant contributed. Alternatively, an equal split would be combined_earning/2. The model should consider which reference point is more relevant.\n\nThe utility function should include terms for the monetary gain (split_self) and terms for fairness/disadvantageous inequality. To reduce parameter covariance, these terms should be on comparable scales. Maybe normalize the monetary term by combined_earning to make it a percentage, while the fairness term is a proportion of the fair share.\n\nFor example, the monetary utility could be \u03b1*(split_self / combined_earning), encouraging higher percentages. The fairness term could penalize offers below the fair share: \u03b2*max((fair_share - split_self)/fair_share, 0), where fair_share is 3*token_self. This way, both terms are unitless and scaled between 0 and 1, helping \u03b1 and \u03b2 to be orthogonal.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that two equal split_self values don't represent the same fairness if combined_earning differs. So maybe the fairness should be relative to the total. Alternatively, using the equal split (combined_earning/2) as the reference. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nIf we use the equal split as the reference, the fairness term becomes max((combined_earning/2 - split_self)/combined_earning, 0), which is the proportion below half. This might better capture fairness independent of contributions. However, participants might care about their own contribution versus the opponent's. So perhaps a hybrid approach: compare the offer to both the equal split and their contribution-based fair share.\n\nBut adding multiple fairness terms could complicate the model. Let's stick to one for simplicity. Given the task mentions token_self and token_opp, the contribution-based fair share (3*token_self) seems relevant. However, if the combined_earning is much larger, maybe participants expect a split based on the total.\n\nAnother angle: disadvantageous inequality could be when the participant's share is less than the opponent's. So split_self < split_opp. The inequality term could be max(split_opp - split_self, 0) normalized by combined_earning. But split_opp + split_self = combined_earning, so split_opp = combined_earning - split_self. Thus, split_opp - split_self = combined_earning - 2*split_self. This might complicate the term, but it's another way to model inequality.\n\nAlternatively, the model could use the ratio of the participant's share to the opponent's share. But that might introduce non-linearity.\n\nTo keep it simple and ensure parameters are recoverable, let's proceed with two terms: one for the monetary value (split_self) and one for disadvantageous inequality relative to their contribution.\n\nMonetary term: \u03b1 * split_self. This is straightforward, higher offers are better.\n\nFairness term: \u03b2 * max((fair_share - split_self)/fair_share, 0), where fair_share = 3*token_self. This term is zero when the offer is at least the fair share, and positive otherwise, penalizing the utility.\n\nHowever, if split_self is in pounds, and fair_share is also in pounds, the term (fair_share - split_self)/fair_share is unitless (a ratio). \u03b2 would then scale how much this ratio affects utility. But \u03b1 is scaling the absolute split_self. These two terms might be on different scales, leading to parameter covariance. For example, if split_self is large, the monetary term dominates, making \u03b2 hard to estimate.\n\nTo address this, perhaps normalize split_self by combined_earning. So the monetary term becomes \u03b1 * (split_self / combined_earning), making it a percentage of the total. The fairness term remains as before. Now both terms are unitless, which might help in parameter recovery.\n\nSo the utility function would be:\n\nU = \u03b1*(split_self / combined_earning) - \u03b2*max((3*token_self - split_self)/(3*token_self), 0)\n\nThe probability of accepting is then logistic(U). If U > 0, the probability is greater than 0.5.\n\nThis model uses two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2. Both are learnable. The ranges for \u03b1 and \u03b2 need to be set. Since they are scaling factors, a reasonable range could be [0, 10] for both, which is generous but finite.\n\nAnother consideration: the fairness term could be relative to the equal split. Let's test that alternative.\n\nFairness term using equal split: max((combined_earning/2 - split_self)/combined_earning, 0). Then the utility becomes:\n\nU = \u03b1*(split_self / combined_earning) - \u03b2*max((0.5 - split_self/combined_earning), 0)\n\nThis simplifies to U = \u03b1*p - \u03b2*max(0.5 - p, 0), where p is the participant's share percentage. This might capture fairness as desiring at least half the total, regardless of contributions. However, the problem states that the fairness depends on contributions, so the first approach using token_self might be more appropriate.\n\nBut the task mentions that trial_type indicates whether contributions are equal, opponent more, or participant more. This suggests that participants are aware of the contribution levels, so the model should incorporate that information. Hence, using the contribution-based fair share (3*token_self) makes sense.\n\nPutting it all together, the model's utility function is:\n\nU = \u03b1*(split_self / combined_earning) - \u03b2*max( (3*token_self - split_self) / (3*token_self), 0 )\n\nThis way, \u03b1 captures the sensitivity to the proportion of the total offer, while \u03b2 captures the aversion to receiving less than their contributed amount. Both terms are unitless and scaled between 0 and 1 (for the fairness term when split_self < 3*token_self). This should help in parameter recovery as the terms are orthogonal; one relates to the total share, the other to the contribution-based fairness.\n\nThe parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 should have positive values since higher monetary share increases utility, and higher disadvantageous inequality decreases utility. Their bounds can be [0, 10], which is wide enough to cover plausible values.\n\nNow, checking the variables used:\n\n- split_self: from the dataset\n- combined_earning: from the dataset\n- token_self: from the dataset\n\nAll these variables are present in the dataset, so the model is feasible.\n\nThe target variable is 'accept', which is binary. The utility U is passed through a logistic function to get the probability of acceptance, which is then used in a Bernoulli likelihood for the binary outcome.\n\nThis model should meet the requirements: predicts responder behavior, uses the provided variables, has learnable parameters with finite bounds, and the utility can be negative (leading to <50% acceptance probability).\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * (split_self / combined_earning) - beta * max( (3 * token_self - split_self) / (3 * token_self), 0 )\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to proportional monetary gain\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Aversion to disadvantageous inequality relative to contribution\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total money in shared pot (\u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Participant's contribution in tokens\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>accept</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA dual-component utility model evaluating proportional monetary gain against contribution-based inequality aversion.

  "full_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts whether a participant accepts or rejects a proposal, focusing on responder behavior. The model needs to use the provided variables appropriately, ensure parameter recovery, and predict utility which translates to acceptance probability via a logistic function.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key factors influencing a responder's decision. The main variables related to the proposal are split_self (the amount offered to the participant) and split_opp (the opponent's share). But the problem mentions that fairness isn't just about the split percentages because the combined earnings vary. So, the model should account for both the absolute offer and the fairness relative to contributions and total earnings.\n\nThe participant's own contribution is token_self, which translates to \u00a33 per token. Similarly, the opponent's contribution is token_opp. The combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). The split_self is the amount offered to the participant from this total.\n\nFairness could be calculated in different ways. One approach is to compare the offer to what's considered a fair share. A fair share based on contributions would be (3*token_self) since that's what the participant contributed. Alternatively, an equal split would be combined_earning/2. The model should consider which reference point is more relevant.\n\nThe utility function should include terms for the monetary gain (split_self) and terms for fairness/disadvantageous inequality. To reduce parameter covariance, these terms should be on comparable scales. Maybe normalize the monetary term by combined_earning to make it a percentage, while the fairness term is a proportion of the fair share.\n\nFor example, the monetary utility could be \u03b1*(split_self / combined_earning), encouraging higher percentages. The fairness term could penalize offers below the fair share: \u03b2*max((fair_share - split_self)/fair_share, 0), where fair_share is 3*token_self. This way, both terms are unitless and scaled between 0 and 1, helping \u03b1 and \u03b2 to be orthogonal.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that two equal split_self values don't represent the same fairness if combined_earning differs. So maybe the fairness should be relative to the total. Alternatively, using the equal split (combined_earning/2) as the reference. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nIf we use the equal split as the reference, the fairness term becomes max((combined_earning/2 - split_self)/combined_earning, 0), which is the proportion below half. This might better capture fairness independent of contributions. However, participants might care about their own contribution versus the opponent's. So perhaps a hybrid approach: compare the offer to both the equal split and their contribution-based fair share.\n\nBut adding multiple fairness terms could complicate the model. Let's stick to one for simplicity. Given the task mentions token_self and token_opp, the contribution-based fair share (3*token_self) seems relevant. However, if the combined_earning is much larger, maybe participants expect a split based on the total.\n\nAnother angle: disadvantageous inequality could be when the participant's share is less than the opponent's. So split_self < split_opp. The inequality term could be max(split_opp - split_self, 0) normalized by combined_earning. But split_opp + split_self = combined_earning, so split_opp = combined_earning - split_self. Thus, split_opp - split_self = combined_earning - 2*split_self. This might complicate the term, but it's another way to model inequality.\n\nAlternatively, the model could use the ratio of the participant's share to the opponent's share. But that might introduce non-linearity.\n\nTo keep it simple and ensure parameters are recoverable, let's proceed with two terms: one for the monetary value (split_self) and one for disadvantageous inequality relative to their contribution.\n\nMonetary term: \u03b1 * split_self. This is straightforward, higher offers are better.\n\nFairness term: \u03b2 * max((fair_share - split_self)/fair_share, 0), where fair_share = 3*token_self. This term is zero when the offer is at least the fair share, and positive otherwise, penalizing the utility.\n\nHowever, if split_self is in pounds, and fair_share is also in pounds, the term (fair_share - split_self)/fair_share is unitless (a ratio). \u03b2 would then scale how much this ratio affects utility. But \u03b1 is scaling the absolute split_self. These two terms might be on different scales, leading to parameter covariance. For example, if split_self is large, the monetary term dominates, making \u03b2 hard to estimate.\n\nTo address this, perhaps normalize split_self by combined_earning. So the monetary term becomes \u03b1 * (split_self / combined_earning), making it a percentage of the total. The fairness term remains as before. Now both terms are unitless, which might help in parameter recovery.\n\nSo the utility function would be:\n\nU = \u03b1*(split_self / combined_earning) - \u03b2*max((3*token_self - split_self)/(3*token_self), 0)\n\nThe probability of accepting is then logistic(U). If U > 0, the probability is greater than 0.5.\n\nThis model uses two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2. Both are learnable. The ranges for \u03b1 and \u03b2 need to be set. Since they are scaling factors, a reasonable range could be [0, 10] for both, which is generous but finite.\n\nAnother consideration: the fairness term could be relative to the equal split. Let's test that alternative.\n\nFairness term using equal split: max((combined_earning/2 - split_self)/combined_earning, 0). Then the utility becomes:\n\nU = \u03b1*(split_self / combined_earning) - \u03b2*max((0.5 - split_self/combined_earning), 0)\n\nThis simplifies to U = \u03b1*p - \u03b2*max(0.5 - p, 0), where p is the participant's share percentage. This might capture fairness as desiring at least half the total, regardless of contributions. However, the problem states that the fairness depends on contributions, so the first approach using token_self might be more appropriate.\n\nBut the task mentions that trial_type indicates whether contributions are equal, opponent more, or participant more. This suggests that participants are aware of the contribution levels, so the model should incorporate that information. Hence, using the contribution-based fair share (3*token_self) makes sense.\n\nPutting it all together, the model's utility function is:\n\nU = \u03b1*(split_self / combined_earning) - \u03b2*max( (3*token_self - split_self) / (3*token_self), 0 )\n\nThis way, \u03b1 captures the sensitivity to the proportion of the total offer, while \u03b2 captures the aversion to receiving less than their contributed amount. Both terms are unitless and scaled between 0 and 1 (for the fairness term when split_self < 3*token_self). This should help in parameter recovery as the terms are orthogonal; one relates to the total share, the other to the contribution-based fairness.\n\nThe parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 should have positive values since higher monetary share increases utility, and higher disadvantageous inequality decreases utility. Their bounds can be [0, 10], which is wide enough to cover plausible values.\n\nNow, checking the variables used:\n\n- split_self: from the dataset\n- combined_earning: from the dataset\n- token_self: from the dataset\n\nAll these variables are present in the dataset, so the model is feasible.\n\nThe target variable is 'accept', which is binary. The utility U is passed through a logistic function to get the probability of acceptance, which is then used in a Bernoulli likelihood for the binary outcome.\n\nThis model should meet the requirements: predicts responder behavior, uses the provided variables, has learnable parameters with finite bounds, and the utility can be negative (leading to <50% acceptance probability).\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * (split_self / combined_earning) - beta * max( (3 * token_self - split_self) / (3 * token_self), 0 )\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to proportional monetary gain\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Aversion to disadvantageous inequality relative to contribution\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total money in shared pot (\u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Participant's contribution in tokens\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>accept</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA dual-component utility model evaluating proportional monetary gain against contribution-based inequality aversion.

The first term captures self-interest through normalized offer size (split_self/combined_earning), while the second term penalizes offers below the participant's contribution value (3*token_self). Parameters alpha (monetary sensitivity) and beta (inequality aversion) operate on orthogonal normalized scales to improve identifiability. Logistic transformation converts utility to acceptance probability.\nTarget Variable: accept\nPrediction Type: utility\nBIC: 33.57277616692939\nOverall Accuracy: 0.8046\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.828\n- beta: r = 0.846"
