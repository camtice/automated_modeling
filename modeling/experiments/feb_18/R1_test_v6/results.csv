1,,"Utility = split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0) - beta * max(split_self - 3 * token_self, 0)","A two-parameter utility model capturing responder behavior through inequality aversion relative to contribution-based fairness. The utility combines the monetary value of the offer with penalties for deviations from the participant's fair share (3 * token_self). Alpha penalizes disadvantageous inequality (offers below fair share), while beta penalizes advantageous inequality (offers above fair share). The model aligns with equity theory and allows distinct sensitivities to under/over-compensation.",v6,0.9309530318580186,0.15734666611965353
