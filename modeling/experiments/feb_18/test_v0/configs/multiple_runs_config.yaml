    You will be given the complete list of models that you have already created. Analyze the models, and notice the absence of possible explanations of behaviors that should be tested. You should start with simple obvious explanations, and as you notice these being thoroughly explored you should shift to fundamentally different models of behavior. Pay less attention to the names of the variables, and how they are actually interacting with the given behavioral data. Start with variables with no learnable parameters, and then shift to comprehensively explore the place with one learnable paramter, and then two, etc.

    Your results will be scored on a combination of BIC with a penalization for number of learned parameters, the ability to recover those learned parameters, and the ability of those parameters to account for the differences in behaviors among varying groups of people.
