      "output": "Let me think through this step by step...\n\nWe need a model that predicts the utility of accepting an offer for a responder.  The key psychological mechanisms are likely to involve both self-interest and fairness considerations.  However, given the previous model, let's explore a different approach focusing on how the *relative* gain compared to the expected gain influences the utility.  This avoids the direct computation of fairness as a ratio, which might be problematic due to the division by zero when `token_self` is zero.  Instead we will directly use the relative gain itself.\n\n\nThe model will consider:\n\n1. **Self-Interest:** The absolute monetary value of the offer (`split_self`). Higher values contribute positively to utility.\n2. **Relative Gain:** The ratio of the offer to the maximum possible gain (combined_earning). A larger relative gain signifies a more favorable outcome relative to a 50/50 split given their relative contributions (in terms of tokens).\n\n\nThe interaction between these two mechanisms can be captured mathematically as a multiplicative function where the relative gain amplifies or dampens the influence of self-interest.\n\n\nThe mathematical form that captures this interaction could be a simple multiplicative model.\n\n\nThe parameters needed would be:\n\n1. `self_interest_weight`:  This parameter reflects the overall importance of self-interest. Higher values indicate a stronger preference for higher monetary gains regardless of relative gain.\n2. `relative_gain_weight`: This parameter scales the impact of the relative gain. A higher value makes the relative gain more influential on the utility of accepting an offer.\n\n\nThe model variables map to observable behavior as follows:  Higher values of `split_self` and higher values of the relative gain will lead to higher utility and a greater probability of acceptance.\n\n\n<MODEL>\nU = self_interest_weight * split_self * (split_self / combined_earning) ^ relative_gain_weight\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"self_interest_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to the absolute monetary value of the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Monetary value of the proposed share for the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money earned by both participants\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"relative_gain_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to relative gain, amplifying or dampening self-interest\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA multiplicative utility model for responder behavior based on self-interest and relative gain.

Relative gain is the ratio of the offer to the maximum possible gain (combined earning).  The model uses two learnable parameters: a weight for self-interest and a weight for the relative gain, which modifies the impact of self-interest based on the relative gain.",
  "full_reasoning": "Let me think through this step by step...\n\nWe need a model that predicts the utility of accepting an offer for a responder.  The key psychological mechanisms are likely to involve both self-interest and fairness considerations.  However, given the previous model, let's explore a different approach focusing on how the *relative* gain compared to the expected gain influences the utility.  This avoids the direct computation of fairness as a ratio, which might be problematic due to the division by zero when `token_self` is zero.  Instead we will directly use the relative gain itself.\n\n\nThe model will consider:\n\n1. **Self-Interest:** The absolute monetary value of the offer (`split_self`). Higher values contribute positively to utility.\n2. **Relative Gain:** The ratio of the offer to the maximum possible gain (combined_earning). A larger relative gain signifies a more favorable outcome relative to a 50/50 split given their relative contributions (in terms of tokens).\n\n\nThe interaction between these two mechanisms can be captured mathematically as a multiplicative function where the relative gain amplifies or dampens the influence of self-interest.\n\n\nThe mathematical form that captures this interaction could be a simple multiplicative model.\n\n\nThe parameters needed would be:\n\n1. `self_interest_weight`:  This parameter reflects the overall importance of self-interest. Higher values indicate a stronger preference for higher monetary gains regardless of relative gain.\n2. `relative_gain_weight`: This parameter scales the impact of the relative gain. A higher value makes the relative gain more influential on the utility of accepting an offer.\n\n\nThe model variables map to observable behavior as follows:  Higher values of `split_self` and higher values of the relative gain will lead to higher utility and a greater probability of acceptance.\n\n\n<MODEL>\nU = self_interest_weight * split_self * (split_self / combined_earning) ^ relative_gain_weight\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"self_interest_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to the absolute monetary value of the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Monetary value of the proposed share for the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money earned by both participants\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"relative_gain_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to relative gain, amplifying or dampening self-interest\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA multiplicative utility model for responder behavior based on self-interest and relative gain.
