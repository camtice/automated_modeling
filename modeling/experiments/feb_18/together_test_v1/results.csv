1,,U_accept = alpha * split_self + beta * (split_perc_self - 50),"A utility model combining absolute self-interest and relative fairness considerations. The model uses two learnable parameters: alpha (α) for absolute self-gain and beta (β) for relative fairness. The utility of accepting an offer increases with both the absolute amount offered and the fairness of the offer relative to an equal split. Negative utility values indicate unfavorable offers, while positive values indicate favorable ones.",v1,,
2,,U_accept = alpha * split_self + beta * (split_perc_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100),A utility model combining absolute self-interest and contribution-based fairness considerations. The model uses two learnable parameters: alpha (α) for absolute self-gain and beta (β) for fairness. Fairness is calculated as the difference between the proposed share percentage and the participant's contribution percentage. The utility of accepting an offer increases with both the absolute amount offered and the fairness of the offer relative to the participant's contribution.,v1,0.5261761819506019,0.8509162954396295
