      "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts the utility of accepting an offer for the responder in the given experiment. The model needs to be based on psychological principles, use the dataset variables appropriately, and have no more than two learnable parameters. Also, it should avoid parameters for stochasticity since that's handled later by a temperature parameter.\n\nFirst, I need to focus on the responder's behavior. The key variables here are the proposed splits (split_self and split_opp), the tokens each participant found (token_self and token_opp), and the combined earnings. The task mentions that fairness isn't just about equal splits because the combined earnings vary. So, the model should account for both the absolute offer and some notion of fairness relative to contributions.\n\nLooking at previous models, Model 1 used split_self and a fairness term based on the participant's contribution (3 * token_self). But maybe there's another angle. Psychological principles like inequity aversion (Fehr & Schmidt) suggest people dislike unequal outcomes. Alternatively, reciprocity or intentions might play a role, but since the task is about utility of accepting, maybe focusing on fairness compared to contributions is better.\n\nThe combined earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so each token is \u00a33. The fair share for the participant would be 3*token_self, and similarly for the opponent. But the split_self is the proposed amount for the participant. So, if the participant's split is less than their contribution, that's unfair. But the opponent's split (split_opp) is their proposed share. Wait, when the participant is the responder, the proposer is the opponent. So, the proposer offers split_self to the responder and keeps split_opp. The responder's contribution is token_self, and the proposer's is token_opp. \n\nSo, the responder might compare their received split_self to their own contribution (3*token_self) and also to the proposer's split_opp relative to their contribution (3*token_opp). Inequity aversion could involve both disadvantageous and advantageous inequality. But since the model should predict the utility of accepting, maybe the responder cares about whether they're getting a fair share compared to both their own contribution and the proposer's share.\n\nAlternatively, the responder might evaluate the offer based on the proportion of the combined earnings they receive (splitperc_self) versus what they contributed (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)). If splitperc_self is less than their contribution percentage, that's unfair. For example, if they contributed 50% of the tokens, getting 40% of the combined earnings would be unfair.\n\nSo, the fairness term could be the difference between the offered percentage (splitperc_self) and their contribution percentage (token_self / (token_self + token_opp) * 100). If this difference is negative, it's unfair. The utility could then be a combination of the absolute offer (split_self) and this fairness term.\n\nBut the problem is that splitperc_self is already a variable in the dataset. However, using splitperc_self directly might not capture the dynamic contribution-based fairness. Let's compute the fair percentage as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. Then, the fairness deviation is splitperc_self - fair_percentage. If this is positive, the offer is more than fair; if negative, less than fair. The utility could then be a weighted sum of split_self and this fairness deviation.\n\nBut since the model needs to use variables from the dataset, maybe we can compute this fair percentage using token_self and token_opp. Let's see: fair_percent_self = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. Then, the difference between splitperc_self and fair_percent_self is the fairness term. So, the utility could be:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (splitperc_self - fair_percent_self)\n\nHere, \u03b2 is the sensitivity to the absolute monetary gain, and \u03b1 is the sensitivity to fairness relative to contribution. If \u03b1 is positive, the responder values offers that are more than their fair share; if negative, they might be averse to unfairness. Wait, but if splitperc_self is less than fair_percent_self, the term becomes negative, which would reduce utility. So \u03b1 being positive would mean the responder dislikes being below their fair share. Alternatively, maybe the model should take the absolute value of the difference, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, using a linear term allows for different responses to over and under fairness. But perhaps the key is that the responder is sensitive to deviations from their fair share, whether positive or negative. However, in the context of accepting an offer, maybe only negative deviations (unfair to self) matter. For example, if the offer is more than fair, the responder might not care as much, but if it's less, they get upset. So maybe the model should include a term that only penalizes when splitperc_self is less than fair_percent_self. That would be similar to the previous model's approach but in percentage terms.\n\nAlternatively, using the difference without an absolute value allows for both under and over to affect utility. But perhaps the responder's utility increases if the offer is more than fair and decreases if less. So the linear term would capture that. However, the problem is that in the dataset, splitperc_self is the percentage offered to the responder. So, if the responder's fair percentage is, say, 50%, and the offer is 40%, the difference is -10%. If \u03b1 is positive, then this term would subtract from the utility. If \u03b1 is negative, it would add. Wait, no: if the model is Utility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (splitperc_self - fair_percent_self), then when splitperc_self is less than fair, the term is negative. If \u03b1 is positive, that would reduce the utility. So \u03b1 being positive means the responder values fairness in the sense that they get utility from offers that are more than their fair share and lose utility when it's less. So, the model would have two parameters: \u03b2 (sensitivity to monetary amount) and \u03b1 (sensitivity to fairness relative to contribution).\n\nBut the problem is that split_self and splitperc_self are correlated. For example, split_self is (splitperc_self / 100) * combined_earning. So, including both might lead to multicollinearity. However, the model needs to have parameters that can be recovered, so we need to avoid high covariance. Therefore, perhaps using either split_self or splitperc_self, but not both. Alternatively, since combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), split_self is (splitperc_self / 100) * 3*(token_self + token_opp). So split_self is a function of splitperc_self and the tokens. Therefore, including split_self and splitperc_self might not be necessary. But the model needs to use variables from the dataset. Let's see: the variables available are split_self (float), splitperc_self (int), token_self, token_opp, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the model should use the absolute split_self and a fairness term based on the ratio of split_self to their contribution. For example, split_self / (3 * token_self) - 1. If this is positive, they get more than their contribution; if negative, less. Then, the utility could be \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self / (3 * token_self) - 1). But this introduces a term that's split_self divided by token_self, which could be problematic if token_self is zero (but in the dataset, token_self is the participant's tokens found in the pretask, so probably non-zero). However, this term would represent how much the offer exceeds their own contribution. But maybe participants care about both their own contribution and the proposer's. For example, if the proposer contributed more, maybe the responder expects a lower share. Alternatively, the fair split could be proportional to contributions. So, fair_share_self = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Then, the difference between split_self and fair_share_self is the fairness term. So, split_self - fair_share_self. If this is positive, the offer is more than fair; if negative, less. Then, the utility could be \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share_self). But combining these terms, that's equivalent to (\u03b2 + \u03b1) * split_self - \u03b1 * fair_share_self. But fair_share_self is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 3*(token_self + token_opp) ) = 3 * token_self. So, split_self - 3 * token_self. Wait, that's exactly the term used in Model 1's fairness component. So, if we use split_self - 3*token_self, then the utility would be \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - 3*token_self) = (\u03b2 + \u03b1) * split_self - \u03b1 * 3 * token_self. But this is similar to Model 1, which had beta * split_self - alpha * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0). The difference is that Model 1 only penalizes when split_self is less than 3*token_self, whereas this model would have a linear term. However, the problem with Model 1 is that it uses a max function, which introduces a non-linearity. But the current task allows for linear models. However, the user wants the model to pass parameter recovery tests, which can be challenging if parameters are highly correlated. So, perhaps using a different formulation.\n\nAlternatively, the utility could be based on the ratio of the offer to the fair share. For example, split_self / (3 * token_self). If this ratio is 1, it's exactly fair. If it's less than 1, unfair. So, the utility could be \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self / (3 * token_self)). But this combines the absolute and relative terms. However, this might lead to issues where the same ratio can correspond to different absolute amounts, but perhaps that's acceptable. Alternatively, using the difference as before.\n\nAnother angle is to consider the proposer's share relative to their contribution. The proposer's split_opp is their share. The proposer's contribution is token_opp, so their fair share would be 3 * token_opp. The proposer's actual share is split_opp. If the proposer is keeping more than their fair share (split_opp > 3 * token_opp), that could be seen as greedy, leading the responder to reject. So, the responder's utility might decrease if the proposer is taking more than their fair share. So, the utility could be \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max( split_opp - 3 * token_opp, 0 ). This captures the responder's own gain and the proposer's unfair gain. But this introduces another term. However, this would require two parameters, which is allowed. But the model needs to have no more than two learnable parameters.\n\nAlternatively, combining both the responder's and proposer's fairness. For example, the responder's utility is \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - 3 * token_self) + gamma * (split_opp - 3 * token_opp). But this would require three parameters, which exceeds the limit. So, perhaps focusing on one aspect.\n\nAnother psychological principle is the notion of reciprocity. If the proposer is making a fair offer based on contributions, the responder might be more inclined to accept. But modeling reciprocity might require more complex terms.\n\nGiven the constraints, perhaps the best approach is to model the utility as a combination of the absolute offer (split_self) and the deviation from the fair share based on the participant's own contribution. The fair share is 3 * token_self, so the deviation is split_self - 3 * token_self. If this is positive, the offer is generous; if negative, it's unfair. The utility could then be:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - 3 * token_self)\n\nSimplifying, this becomes (\u03b2 + \u03b1) * split_self - 3 * \u03b1 * token_self. However, this combines the two parameters into a linear combination. But with two parameters, \u03b2 and \u03b1, this allows the model to capture both the direct monetary effect and the fairness effect. However, this might lead to parameter covariance because \u03b2 and \u03b1 are both multiplied by split_self. To avoid this, perhaps separate the terms into split_self and the deviation term. Alternatively, use one parameter for the monetary term and another for the fairness term. For example:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - 3 * token_self)\n\nBut this is equivalent to (\u03b2 + \u03b1) * split_self - 3 * \u03b1 * token_self. So, if we have two parameters, \u03b2 and \u03b1, but they are combined in the model, this could lead to identifiability issues. For example, increasing \u03b2 and decreasing \u03b1 could result in the same utility. To avoid this, perhaps the fairness term should be orthogonal. Alternatively, use a different formulation where the parameters are not multiplied by the same variable. For example, use:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self / (3 * token_self) - 1)\n\nHere, the term (split_self / (3 * token_self) - 1) represents the proportional deviation from the fair share. If split_self equals 3 * token_self, the term is zero. If it's higher, positive; lower, negative. Then, \u03b1 captures the sensitivity to proportional fairness. This way, \u03b2 and \u03b1 are multiplied by different terms (split_self and the proportional deviation), which might reduce covariance. However, if token_self varies across trials, this term's scale could vary, affecting parameter recovery.\n\nAlternatively, use the difference between split_self and the fair share, scaled by some factor. But perhaps the simplest way is to have two terms: one for the absolute offer and one for the fairness relative to contribution. This would use two parameters, \u03b2 and \u03b1, which are learnable. The model would then be:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - 3 * token_self)\n\nBut this can be rewritten as (\u03b2 + \u03b1) * split_self - 3 * \u03b1 * token_self. However, this introduces a dependency between \u03b2 and \u03b1. To make the parameters more identifiable, perhaps separate the terms into split_self and a separate fairness term. For example, the fairness term could be max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0), which is the deficit relative to the fair share. Then, the utility is:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nThis is similar to Model 1 mentioned earlier. However, the user wants a new model that explores different mechanisms. Since Model 1 already uses this approach, perhaps a different angle is needed.\n\nAnother idea is to consider the ratio of the proposer's share to their contribution compared to the responder's. For example, the proposer's share is split_opp, and their contribution is 3 * token_opp. The responder's share is split_self, contribution is 3 * token_self. The ratio (split_opp / (3 * token_opp)) compared to (split_self / (3 * token_self)) could be a fairness measure. If the proposer is keeping a higher ratio than the responder, that's unfair. So, the term could be (split_opp / (3 * token_opp)) - (split_self / (3 * token_self)). If this is positive, the proposer is taking more relative to their contribution. The utility could then be:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * [(split_self / (3 * token_self)) - (split_opp / (3 * token_opp))]\n\nHere, \u03b1 captures the sensitivity to relative fairness. If the responder's ratio is higher, utility increases; if lower, decreases. This introduces a term that compares both parties' shares relative to their contributions. However, this requires two parameters, \u03b2 and \u03b1. But this might capture a different fairness mechanism than Model 1. However, this model uses split_opp, which is available in the dataset. But the problem is that when the participant is the responder, split_opp is the proposer's share, which they are keeping. So, this term compares how much each is getting relative to their contribution. This could be a form of inequity aversion where the responder cares about the ratio rather than absolute differences.\n\nBut this model would have two parameters, \u03b2 and \u03b1. The question is whether this model would have identifiable parameters. The term (split_self / (3 * token_self)) - (split_opp / (3 * token_opp)) could be rewritten as (split_self * token_opp - split_opp * token_self) / (3 * token_self * token_opp), but that's more complex. However, in terms of utility, it's a linear combination of split_self and split_opp, scaled by their respective tokens. This might introduce non-linear interactions, but the parameters \u03b2 and \u03b1 are linear coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, to simplify, perhaps use the difference in percentages. The splitperc_self is the percentage offered to the responder, and splitperc_opp is the proposer's percentage. Since combined_earning is fixed per trial, splitperc_opp = 100 - splitperc_self. But the fair percentages would be based on tokens: fair_perc_self = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The difference between splitperc_self and fair_perc_self could be the fairness term. So:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (splitperc_self - fair_perc_self)\n\nHere, fair_perc_self is calculated as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. This term represents how much the offered percentage deviates from the fair percentage based on contributions. If the offered percentage is higher than fair, utility increases; if lower, decreases. This model uses split_self (absolute amount) and the percentage deviation (relative fairness). This combines both absolute and relative measures. However, split_self and splitperc_self are related because split_self = (splitperc_self / 100) * combined_earning. So, there's a potential multicollinearity issue. But with two parameters, \u03b2 and \u03b1, this might still be manageable if the data has enough variation.\n\nAnother consideration is that the combined earning varies per trial, so the same split percentage can correspond to different absolute amounts. The model should account for that. By including split_self (the absolute amount) and the percentage deviation, the model captures both the absolute gain and the relative fairness. This could be a good approach.\n\nSo, the model would be:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (splitperc_self - fair_perc_self)\n\nWhere fair_perc_self = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100.\n\nThis model uses two learnable parameters: \u03b2 (sensitivity to absolute offer) and \u03b1 (sensitivity to percentage fairness). The variables used are split_self (from data), splitperc_self (from data), token_self, and token_opp (to calculate fair_perc_self). All these variables are available in the dataset.\n\nThis model addresses both the monetary value of the offer and the fairness relative to contributions in percentage terms. The parameters \u03b2 and \u03b1 can be bounded, say between -10 and 10, to allow for both positive and negative sensitivities. For example, a positive \u03b1 means the responder values offers that are more than their fair percentage, while a negative \u03b1 would mean they penalize offers below the fair percentage. However, since the utility is for accepting, a positive \u03b1 would increase utility when the offer is fairer, making acceptance more likely.\n\nNow, checking the constraints:\n\n1. Predicts responder behavior: Yes, as it's based on the responder's perspective.\n2. Builds on psychological principles: Yes, inequity aversion relative to contributions.\n3. Considers parameter covariance: By combining absolute and percentage terms, which are related but distinct, covariance might be manageable.\n4. Uses dataset variables: split_self, splitperc_self, token_self, token_opp are all available.\n5. No stochastic parameters: Correct, only \u03b2 and \u03b1 are learnable.\n6. Two parameters: Yes, \u03b2 and \u03b1.\n7. Utility can be negative: Yes, depending on the terms.\n\nVariable descriptions:\n\n- \u03b2: Sensitivity to the absolute monetary offer (split_self). Learnable, with bounds, say, -10 to 10.\n- \u03b1: Sensitivity to the deviation from fair percentage. Learnable, same bounds.\n- split_self: From data, the proposed amount for the participant.\n- splitperc_self: From data, the proposed percentage.\n- token_self and token_opp: From data, used to calculate fair_perc_self.\n- fair_perc_self: Calculated as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100.\n\nThe mathematical model would then be:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (splitperc_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100 )\n\nThis model uses two learnable parameters, \u03b2 and \u03b1, and the variables split_self, splitperc_self, token_self, and token_opp. The parameters are bounded to prevent unrealistic values but allow flexibility.\n\nNow, checking for parameter recovery: If \u03b2 and \u03b1 are orthogonal in their effects, recovery is feasible. For example, trials with high split_self but low fairness deviation would affect \u03b2 more, while trials with varying fairness deviations would affect \u03b1. However, there might still be some covariance, but with proper experimental design (varied token_self and token_opp), it's manageable.\n\nIn summary, this model combines absolute monetary gain with fairness in terms of percentage deviation from the contribution-based fair share. It uses two parameters to capture these effects, adhering to the task constraints.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = beta * split_self + alpha * (splitperc_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to absolute monetary gain from the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to deviation from contribution-based fair percentage\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed monetary amount for the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"splitperc_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed percentage share for the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Participant's contribution in tokens (converted to \u00a33 per token)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Opponent's contribution in tokens (converted to \u00a33 per token)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA dual-component utility model combining absolute monetary value (split_self) and proportional fairness relative to contributions.

  "model_summary": "A dual-component utility model combining absolute monetary value (split_self) and proportional fairness relative to contributions. The fairness component compares the offered percentage (splitperc_self) to the contribution-based fair percentage [(token_self/(token_self+token_opp))*100]. Two learnable parameters (beta, alpha) capture sensitivity to monetary gains and equity considerations respectively, enabling simultaneous modeling of self-interest and contribution-based inequity aversion.",
  "full_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts the utility of accepting an offer for the responder in the given experiment. The model needs to be based on psychological principles, use the dataset variables appropriately, and have no more than two learnable parameters. Also, it should avoid parameters for stochasticity since that's handled later by a temperature parameter.\n\nFirst, I need to focus on the responder's behavior. The key variables here are the proposed splits (split_self and split_opp), the tokens each participant found (token_self and token_opp), and the combined earnings. The task mentions that fairness isn't just about equal splits because the combined earnings vary. So, the model should account for both the absolute offer and some notion of fairness relative to contributions.\n\nLooking at previous models, Model 1 used split_self and a fairness term based on the participant's contribution (3 * token_self). But maybe there's another angle. Psychological principles like inequity aversion (Fehr & Schmidt) suggest people dislike unequal outcomes. Alternatively, reciprocity or intentions might play a role, but since the task is about utility of accepting, maybe focusing on fairness compared to contributions is better.\n\nThe combined earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so each token is \u00a33. The fair share for the participant would be 3*token_self, and similarly for the opponent. But the split_self is the proposed amount for the participant. So, if the participant's split is less than their contribution, that's unfair. But the opponent's split (split_opp) is their proposed share. Wait, when the participant is the responder, the proposer is the opponent. So, the proposer offers split_self to the responder and keeps split_opp. The responder's contribution is token_self, and the proposer's is token_opp. \n\nSo, the responder might compare their received split_self to their own contribution (3*token_self) and also to the proposer's split_opp relative to their contribution (3*token_opp). Inequity aversion could involve both disadvantageous and advantageous inequality. But since the model should predict the utility of accepting, maybe the responder cares about whether they're getting a fair share compared to both their own contribution and the proposer's share.\n\nAlternatively, the responder might evaluate the offer based on the proportion of the combined earnings they receive (splitperc_self) versus what they contributed (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)). If splitperc_self is less than their contribution percentage, that's unfair. For example, if they contributed 50% of the tokens, getting 40% of the combined earnings would be unfair.\n\nSo, the fairness term could be the difference between the offered percentage (splitperc_self) and their contribution percentage (token_self / (token_self + token_opp) * 100). If this difference is negative, it's unfair. The utility could then be a combination of the absolute offer (split_self) and this fairness term.\n\nBut the problem is that splitperc_self is already a variable in the dataset. However, using splitperc_self directly might not capture the dynamic contribution-based fairness. Let's compute the fair percentage as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. Then, the fairness deviation is splitperc_self - fair_percentage. If this is positive, the offer is more than fair; if negative, less than fair. The utility could then be a weighted sum of split_self and this fairness deviation.\n\nBut since the model needs to use variables from the dataset, maybe we can compute this fair percentage using token_self and token_opp. Let's see: fair_percent_self = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. Then, the difference between splitperc_self and fair_percent_self is the fairness term. So, the utility could be:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (splitperc_self - fair_percent_self)\n\nHere, \u03b2 is the sensitivity to the absolute monetary gain, and \u03b1 is the sensitivity to fairness relative to contribution. If \u03b1 is positive, the responder values offers that are more than their fair share; if negative, they might be averse to unfairness. Wait, but if splitperc_self is less than fair_percent_self, the term becomes negative, which would reduce utility. So \u03b1 being positive would mean the responder dislikes being below their fair share. Alternatively, maybe the model should take the absolute value of the difference, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, using a linear term allows for different responses to over and under fairness. But perhaps the key is that the responder is sensitive to deviations from their fair share, whether positive or negative. However, in the context of accepting an offer, maybe only negative deviations (unfair to self) matter. For example, if the offer is more than fair, the responder might not care as much, but if it's less, they get upset. So maybe the model should include a term that only penalizes when splitperc_self is less than fair_percent_self. That would be similar to the previous model's approach but in percentage terms.\n\nAlternatively, using the difference without an absolute value allows for both under and over to affect utility. But perhaps the responder's utility increases if the offer is more than fair and decreases if less. So the linear term would capture that. However, the problem is that in the dataset, splitperc_self is the percentage offered to the responder. So, if the responder's fair percentage is, say, 50%, and the offer is 40%, the difference is -10%. If \u03b1 is positive, then this term would subtract from the utility. If \u03b1 is negative, it would add. Wait, no: if the model is Utility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (splitperc_self - fair_percent_self), then when splitperc_self is less than fair, the term is negative. If \u03b1 is positive, that would reduce the utility. So \u03b1 being positive means the responder values fairness in the sense that they get utility from offers that are more than their fair share and lose utility when it's less. So, the model would have two parameters: \u03b2 (sensitivity to monetary amount) and \u03b1 (sensitivity to fairness relative to contribution).\n\nBut the problem is that split_self and splitperc_self are correlated. For example, split_self is (splitperc_self / 100) * combined_earning. So, including both might lead to multicollinearity. However, the model needs to have parameters that can be recovered, so we need to avoid high covariance. Therefore, perhaps using either split_self or splitperc_self, but not both. Alternatively, since combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), split_self is (splitperc_self / 100) * 3*(token_self + token_opp). So split_self is a function of splitperc_self and the tokens. Therefore, including split_self and splitperc_self might not be necessary. But the model needs to use variables from the dataset. Let's see: the variables available are split_self (float), splitperc_self (int), token_self, token_opp, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the model should use the absolute split_self and a fairness term based on the ratio of split_self to their contribution. For example, split_self / (3 * token_self) - 1. If this is positive, they get more than their contribution; if negative, less. Then, the utility could be \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self / (3 * token_self) - 1). But this introduces a term that's split_self divided by token_self, which could be problematic if token_self is zero (but in the dataset, token_self is the participant's tokens found in the pretask, so probably non-zero). However, this term would represent how much the offer exceeds their own contribution. But maybe participants care about both their own contribution and the proposer's. For example, if the proposer contributed more, maybe the responder expects a lower share. Alternatively, the fair split could be proportional to contributions. So, fair_share_self = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Then, the difference between split_self and fair_share_self is the fairness term. So, split_self - fair_share_self. If this is positive, the offer is more than fair; if negative, less. Then, the utility could be \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share_self). But combining these terms, that's equivalent to (\u03b2 + \u03b1) * split_self - \u03b1 * fair_share_self. But fair_share_self is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 3*(token_self + token_opp) ) = 3 * token_self. So, split_self - 3 * token_self. Wait, that's exactly the term used in Model 1's fairness component. So, if we use split_self - 3*token_self, then the utility would be \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - 3*token_self) = (\u03b2 + \u03b1) * split_self - \u03b1 * 3 * token_self. But this is similar to Model 1, which had beta * split_self - alpha * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0). The difference is that Model 1 only penalizes when split_self is less than 3*token_self, whereas this model would have a linear term. However, the problem with Model 1 is that it uses a max function, which introduces a non-linearity. But the current task allows for linear models. However, the user wants the model to pass parameter recovery tests, which can be challenging if parameters are highly correlated. So, perhaps using a different formulation.\n\nAlternatively, the utility could be based on the ratio of the offer to the fair share. For example, split_self / (3 * token_self). If this ratio is 1, it's exactly fair. If it's less than 1, unfair. So, the utility could be \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self / (3 * token_self)). But this combines the absolute and relative terms. However, this might lead to issues where the same ratio can correspond to different absolute amounts, but perhaps that's acceptable. Alternatively, using the difference as before.\n\nAnother angle is to consider the proposer's share relative to their contribution. The proposer's split_opp is their share. The proposer's contribution is token_opp, so their fair share would be 3 * token_opp. The proposer's actual share is split_opp. If the proposer is keeping more than their fair share (split_opp > 3 * token_opp), that could be seen as greedy, leading the responder to reject. So, the responder's utility might decrease if the proposer is taking more than their fair share. So, the utility could be \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max( split_opp - 3 * token_opp, 0 ). This captures the responder's own gain and the proposer's unfair gain. But this introduces another term. However, this would require two parameters, which is allowed. But the model needs to have no more than two learnable parameters.\n\nAlternatively, combining both the responder's and proposer's fairness. For example, the responder's utility is \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - 3 * token_self) + gamma * (split_opp - 3 * token_opp). But this would require three parameters, which exceeds the limit. So, perhaps focusing on one aspect.\n\nAnother psychological principle is the notion of reciprocity. If the proposer is making a fair offer based on contributions, the responder might be more inclined to accept. But modeling reciprocity might require more complex terms.\n\nGiven the constraints, perhaps the best approach is to model the utility as a combination of the absolute offer (split_self) and the deviation from the fair share based on the participant's own contribution. The fair share is 3 * token_self, so the deviation is split_self - 3 * token_self. If this is positive, the offer is generous; if negative, it's unfair. The utility could then be:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - 3 * token_self)\n\nSimplifying, this becomes (\u03b2 + \u03b1) * split_self - 3 * \u03b1 * token_self. However, this combines the two parameters into a linear combination. But with two parameters, \u03b2 and \u03b1, this allows the model to capture both the direct monetary effect and the fairness effect. However, this might lead to parameter covariance because \u03b2 and \u03b1 are both multiplied by split_self. To avoid this, perhaps separate the terms into split_self and the deviation term. Alternatively, use one parameter for the monetary term and another for the fairness term. For example:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - 3 * token_self)\n\nBut this is equivalent to (\u03b2 + \u03b1) * split_self - 3 * \u03b1 * token_self. So, if we have two parameters, \u03b2 and \u03b1, but they are combined in the model, this could lead to identifiability issues. For example, increasing \u03b2 and decreasing \u03b1 could result in the same utility. To avoid this, perhaps the fairness term should be orthogonal. Alternatively, use a different formulation where the parameters are not multiplied by the same variable. For example, use:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self / (3 * token_self) - 1)\n\nHere, the term (split_self / (3 * token_self) - 1) represents the proportional deviation from the fair share. If split_self equals 3 * token_self, the term is zero. If it's higher, positive; lower, negative. Then, \u03b1 captures the sensitivity to proportional fairness. This way, \u03b2 and \u03b1 are multiplied by different terms (split_self and the proportional deviation), which might reduce covariance. However, if token_self varies across trials, this term's scale could vary, affecting parameter recovery.\n\nAlternatively, use the difference between split_self and the fair share, scaled by some factor. But perhaps the simplest way is to have two terms: one for the absolute offer and one for the fairness relative to contribution. This would use two parameters, \u03b2 and \u03b1, which are learnable. The model would then be:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - 3 * token_self)\n\nBut this can be rewritten as (\u03b2 + \u03b1) * split_self - 3 * \u03b1 * token_self. However, this introduces a dependency between \u03b2 and \u03b1. To make the parameters more identifiable, perhaps separate the terms into split_self and a separate fairness term. For example, the fairness term could be max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0), which is the deficit relative to the fair share. Then, the utility is:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nThis is similar to Model 1 mentioned earlier. However, the user wants a new model that explores different mechanisms. Since Model 1 already uses this approach, perhaps a different angle is needed.\n\nAnother idea is to consider the ratio of the proposer's share to their contribution compared to the responder's. For example, the proposer's share is split_opp, and their contribution is 3 * token_opp. The responder's share is split_self, contribution is 3 * token_self. The ratio (split_opp / (3 * token_opp)) compared to (split_self / (3 * token_self)) could be a fairness measure. If the proposer is keeping a higher ratio than the responder, that's unfair. So, the term could be (split_opp / (3 * token_opp)) - (split_self / (3 * token_self)). If this is positive, the proposer is taking more relative to their contribution. The utility could then be:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * [(split_self / (3 * token_self)) - (split_opp / (3 * token_opp))]\n\nHere, \u03b1 captures the sensitivity to relative fairness. If the responder's ratio is higher, utility increases; if lower, decreases. This introduces a term that compares both parties' shares relative to their contributions. However, this requires two parameters, \u03b2 and \u03b1. But this might capture a different fairness mechanism than Model 1. However, this model uses split_opp, which is available in the dataset. But the problem is that when the participant is the responder, split_opp is the proposer's share, which they are keeping. So, this term compares how much each is getting relative to their contribution. This could be a form of inequity aversion where the responder cares about the ratio rather than absolute differences.\n\nBut this model would have two parameters, \u03b2 and \u03b1. The question is whether this model would have identifiable parameters. The term (split_self / (3 * token_self)) - (split_opp / (3 * token_opp)) could be rewritten as (split_self * token_opp - split_opp * token_self) / (3 * token_self * token_opp), but that's more complex. However, in terms of utility, it's a linear combination of split_self and split_opp, scaled by their respective tokens. This might introduce non-linear interactions, but the parameters \u03b2 and \u03b1 are linear coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, to simplify, perhaps use the difference in percentages. The splitperc_self is the percentage offered to the responder, and splitperc_opp is the proposer's percentage. Since combined_earning is fixed per trial, splitperc_opp = 100 - splitperc_self. But the fair percentages would be based on tokens: fair_perc_self = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The difference between splitperc_self and fair_perc_self could be the fairness term. So:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (splitperc_self - fair_perc_self)\n\nHere, fair_perc_self is calculated as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. This term represents how much the offered percentage deviates from the fair percentage based on contributions. If the offered percentage is higher than fair, utility increases; if lower, decreases. This model uses split_self (absolute amount) and the percentage deviation (relative fairness). This combines both absolute and relative measures. However, split_self and splitperc_self are related because split_self = (splitperc_self / 100) * combined_earning. So, there's a potential multicollinearity issue. But with two parameters, \u03b2 and \u03b1, this might still be manageable if the data has enough variation.\n\nAnother consideration is that the combined earning varies per trial, so the same split percentage can correspond to different absolute amounts. The model should account for that. By including split_self (the absolute amount) and the percentage deviation, the model captures both the absolute gain and the relative fairness. This could be a good approach.\n\nSo, the model would be:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (splitperc_self - fair_perc_self)\n\nWhere fair_perc_self = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100.\n\nThis model uses two learnable parameters: \u03b2 (sensitivity to absolute offer) and \u03b1 (sensitivity to percentage fairness). The variables used are split_self (from data), splitperc_self (from data), token_self, and token_opp (to calculate fair_perc_self). All these variables are available in the dataset.\n\nThis model addresses both the monetary value of the offer and the fairness relative to contributions in percentage terms. The parameters \u03b2 and \u03b1 can be bounded, say between -10 and 10, to allow for both positive and negative sensitivities. For example, a positive \u03b1 means the responder values offers that are more than their fair percentage, while a negative \u03b1 would mean they penalize offers below the fair percentage. However, since the utility is for accepting, a positive \u03b1 would increase utility when the offer is fairer, making acceptance more likely.\n\nNow, checking the constraints:\n\n1. Predicts responder behavior: Yes, as it's based on the responder's perspective.\n2. Builds on psychological principles: Yes, inequity aversion relative to contributions.\n3. Considers parameter covariance: By combining absolute and percentage terms, which are related but distinct, covariance might be manageable.\n4. Uses dataset variables: split_self, splitperc_self, token_self, token_opp are all available.\n5. No stochastic parameters: Correct, only \u03b2 and \u03b1 are learnable.\n6. Two parameters: Yes, \u03b2 and \u03b1.\n7. Utility can be negative: Yes, depending on the terms.\n\nVariable descriptions:\n\n- \u03b2: Sensitivity to the absolute monetary offer (split_self). Learnable, with bounds, say, -10 to 10.\n- \u03b1: Sensitivity to the deviation from fair percentage. Learnable, same bounds.\n- split_self: From data, the proposed amount for the participant.\n- splitperc_self: From data, the proposed percentage.\n- token_self and token_opp: From data, used to calculate fair_perc_self.\n- fair_perc_self: Calculated as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100.\n\nThe mathematical model would then be:\n\nUtility = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (splitperc_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100 )\n\nThis model uses two learnable parameters, \u03b2 and \u03b1, and the variables split_self, splitperc_self, token_self, and token_opp. The parameters are bounded to prevent unrealistic values but allow flexibility.\n\nNow, checking for parameter recovery: If \u03b2 and \u03b1 are orthogonal in their effects, recovery is feasible. For example, trials with high split_self but low fairness deviation would affect \u03b2 more, while trials with varying fairness deviations would affect \u03b1. However, there might still be some covariance, but with proper experimental design (varied token_self and token_opp), it's manageable.\n\nIn summary, this model combines absolute monetary gain with fairness in terms of percentage deviation from the contribution-based fair share. It uses two parameters to capture these effects, adhering to the task constraints.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = beta * split_self + alpha * (splitperc_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to absolute monetary gain from the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to deviation from contribution-based fair percentage\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed monetary amount for the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"splitperc_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed percentage share for the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Participant's contribution in tokens (converted to \u00a33 per token)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Opponent's contribution in tokens (converted to \u00a33 per token)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA dual-component utility model combining absolute monetary value (split_self) and proportional fairness relative to contributions.
