      "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts the utility of accepting an offer for the responder in the given experiment. The model needs to be based on psychological principles, use the dataset variables appropriately, and have no more than two learnable parameters. Also, it should avoid high covariance between parameters and pass parameter recovery tests.\n\nFirst, I need to focus on the responder's behavior. The key variables here are split_self (the amount offered to the participant), token_self and token_opp (their contributions), combined_earning, and trial_type. The previous models have considered absolute monetary gain, fairness relative to contributions, and quadratic terms for inequity. To come up with a new model, I should think of a different psychological mechanism that hasn't been covered yet.\n\nLooking at the previous models: Model 1 uses a linear penalty for getting less than their fair share. Model 2 compares the percentage offered to their contribution percentage. Model 3 uses a quadratic term for deviations from fair share. So maybe a new angle is to consider the ratio of the offer to their contribution, or perhaps the ratio of the split to the combined earnings. Another idea is to model the utility as a function of both the absolute offer and the relative fairness compared to the opponent's contribution.\n\nWait, the trial_type variable indicates whether the contribution was equal, opponent more, or participant more. This might interact with how the responder perceives fairness. For example, if the trial_type is \"participant more\" (they contributed more), they might expect a higher share. So maybe the utility depends on the interaction between the offer and the trial type. But trial_type is a categorical variable (1,2,3), so how to incorporate that?\n\nAlternatively, the model could consider the difference between the split_self and what would be considered fair based on their contribution. The fair share would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Let's compute that. For example, if combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), since each token is \u00a33. So the fair share would be 3*token_self. Wait, combined_earning is exactly 3*(token_self + token_opp), right? Because each token is \u00a33. So the fair share is 3*token_self. But split_self is the amount offered to the participant. So the difference between split_self and 3*token_self could be a factor. But Model 1 and Model 3 already use this difference. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: the ratio of the offer to the fair share. So split_self / (3*token_self). If this ratio is less than 1, the offer is below their contribution-based fair share, which might lead to lower utility. But how to model that? Maybe a parameter that scales this ratio. For example, utility could be beta * split_self + alpha * (split_self / (3*token_self)). But that might not capture the psychological principle well. Alternatively, using a reference point where the fair share is the reference, and deviations from that affect utility. Prospect theory suggests that losses (getting less than reference) are more impactful than gains. So maybe a piecewise function where if split_self is less than fair share, there's a penalty, and if it's more, maybe a smaller bonus. But Model 1 uses a max function for the deficit. Maybe a different approach is needed.\n\nWait, the problem states that two equal split_self values don't represent the same fairness because combined_earning varies. So the same split_self could be a different proportion of the total. For example, if combined_earning is higher, split_self might be a smaller percentage even if the absolute value is the same. So perhaps the model should consider the percentage split (splitperc_self) relative to their contribution percentage. The contribution percentage is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The offered percentage is splitperc_self. The difference between these could be a fairness component. Model 2 uses this difference. So maybe that's already covered.\n\nAlternatively, the model could use the ratio of the offered percentage to the contribution percentage. For example, (splitperc_self / (token_self_percent)). If this ratio is 1, it's perfectly fair. If less than 1, unfair. So the utility could be beta * split_self + alpha * (splitperc_self / token_self_percent - 1). But this might not capture the nonlinear aspects. Or perhaps log of the ratio, which is similar to inequity aversion in some models. But that's getting complex.\n\nAnother thought: the utility could be a combination of the absolute monetary gain (split_self) and the relative gain compared to the opponent's split. For example, if the responder cares about how much they get compared to the proposer. But in the responder role, the proposer's split is split_opp. So split_self vs split_opp. But combined_earning is split_self + split_opp. So maybe the ratio of split_self to split_opp. But this might not be directly relevant if the responder is focused on their own share relative to their contribution.\n\nWait, the trial_role is 1 for responder. So when trial_role is 1, the participant is responding to an offer made by the opponent. The proposer's variables (split_opp and split_self) are the offers. So the responder's utility could depend on how the offer compares to their own contribution and the opponent's contribution. For example, if the responder contributed more (token_self > token_opp), they might expect a higher split. So the fairness component could be the difference between the offered split and their contribution-based fair share, scaled by some parameter.\n\nBut Models 1 and 3 already use the difference between split_self and 3*token_self. To differentiate, perhaps the model should include a term that compares the split percentage to the contribution percentage, but in a multiplicative way. For example, the utility could be split_self multiplied by a factor that depends on how fair the split is relative to contributions. So U = split_self * (1 + alpha * (splitperc_self - fair_percent)/100), where fair_percent is (token_self/(token_self + token_opp))*100. This way, if the split is fair, the utility is just split_self. If it's more than fair, utility increases, and if less, it decreases. The parameter alpha scales the importance of fairness relative to the monetary amount. But this introduces a multiplicative term between split_self and the fairness component. However, this might lead to parameter covariance if alpha and beta (if there's a beta) are both present. Wait, the model needs to have up to two learnable parameters. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, the utility could be a weighted sum of the absolute offer and the ratio of the offer to the fair share. For example:\n\nU = beta * split_self + alpha * (split_self / (3 * token_self))\n\nHere, beta represents the sensitivity to the absolute monetary value, and alpha represents the sensitivity to the ratio of the offer to their contribution-based fair share. If alpha is positive, getting more than the fair share (split_self > 3*token_self) increases utility, and less decreases it. But this might not capture the idea that people might be more sensitive to receiving less than their fair share. So maybe a piecewise function where the effect is different when split_self is below or above the fair share. But that would require more parameters. However, the problem allows up to two parameters. Alternatively, using a term that is split_self minus the fair share, multiplied by a parameter. But that's similar to Model 1.\n\nWait, Model 1 uses max(3*token_self - split_self, 0), which is a linear penalty for offers below the fair share. Model 3 uses a quadratic term. To differentiate, perhaps the model should consider the proportion of the fair share that the offer represents. For example, if the offer is 80% of the fair share, the disutility is proportional to the 20% deficit. So the utility could be:\n\nU = beta * split_self - alpha * ( (3 * token_self - split_self) / (3 * token_self) )\n\nThis term (3*token_self - split_self)/(3*token_self) represents the proportional deficit relative to the fair share. If split_self is less than fair share, this term is positive, leading to a penalty. If split_self is equal or more, the term is zero or negative (but since we have a minus alpha, a negative term would add to utility). Wait, but if split_self is more than fair share, then (3*token_self - split_self) is negative, so the term becomes negative, and multiplied by -alpha, it becomes positive. So this would reward offers above the fair share. But maybe responders don't care about getting more than their fair share, only about getting less. So perhaps we should take the max of (fair share - split_self, 0) divided by fair share. Then the term is only active when split_self is below fair share. So:\n\nU = beta * split_self - alpha * ( max(3*token_self - split_self, 0) / (3*token_self) )\n\nThis way, the disutility is proportional to the percentage deficit relative to the fair share. For example, if the fair share is \u00a310 and the offer is \u00a38, the deficit is \u00a32, which is 20% of the fair share. The penalty would be alpha * 0.2. This captures the idea that people are sensitive to the relative amount they're losing compared to their fair share, not just the absolute amount. This could be a different psychological mechanism than the previous models. The parameters beta and alpha would represent the sensitivity to absolute gains and relative deficit, respectively. This model would have two learnable parameters, which fits the requirement.\n\nAnother consideration is the combined_earning. Since combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), but the model already uses token_self, maybe that's sufficient. The key is that the model uses variables available in the dataset. The variables used here are split_self and token_self, which are present.\n\nNow, checking the previous models: Model 1 uses max(3*token_self - split_self, 0), which is the absolute deficit. This model uses the relative deficit (as a proportion of fair share). So this is a different approach. The parameters here would capture how much the responder cares about the absolute amount (beta) versus the proportional loss (alpha). This could help in parameter recovery since the two terms are in different units (absolute vs relative), reducing covariance.\n\nThe mathematical model would then be:\n\nU_accept = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * ( max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0) / (3 * token_self) )\n\nHere, \u03b2 is the weight on the absolute monetary gain, and \u03b1 is the weight on the proportional deficit relative to the fair share. The max function ensures that only deficits (offers below fair share) are penalized. Offers above fair share do not contribute to the penalty term.\n\nNow, checking the constraints: the model uses only variables present in the dataset (split_self, token_self). It has two learnable parameters (alpha and beta), which need to have finite bounds. For alpha and beta, since they are weights, they can be constrained to be positive. For example, beta could be in [0, 10] and alpha in [0, 20]. The exact bounds can be generous but finite. The utility can be any real number.\n\nAnother consideration: if token_self is zero, division by zero occurs. But in the task, participants have a pretask where they find tokens, so token_self is at least 1? The dataset's token_self is int64, so possible values are non-negative. But if token_self is zero, the fair share is zero, which might not make sense. However, in the experiment, participants must have contributed some tokens, so token_self is likely always positive. So the denominator is safe.\n\nVariable descriptions:\n\n- \u03b2 (beta): Learnable parameter representing sensitivity to absolute monetary gain. Range [0, 10], inclusive.\n- \u03b1 (alpha): Learnable parameter representing sensitivity to proportional deficit relative to fair share. Range [0, 20], inclusive.\n- split_self: From data, the proposed share for the participant.\n- token_self: From data, the participant's tokens.\n\nThe utility is calculated as \u03b2 multiplied by split_self minus \u03b1 multiplied by the proportional deficit (if any). This model captures both the direct monetary incentive and the aversion to receiving less than their contribution-based fair share, scaled by how much they're missing proportionally.\n\nThis model meets all the requirements: two learnable parameters, uses dataset variables, focuses on responder behavior, builds on psychological principles (inequity aversion with proportional loss), and avoids parameters for stochasticity. The parameters are likely to have lower covariance because one is in absolute terms and the other in relative terms.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = beta * split_self - alpha * (max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0) / (3 * token_self))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to absolute monetary gain\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to proportional deficit relative to fair share\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed monetary amount for participant (in \u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens contributed by participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA dual-component utility model combining absolute monetary value with aversion to proportional deficits relative to contribution-based fairness.

  "full_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts the utility of accepting an offer for the responder in the given experiment. The model needs to be based on psychological principles, use the dataset variables appropriately, and have no more than two learnable parameters. Also, it should avoid high covariance between parameters and pass parameter recovery tests.\n\nFirst, I need to focus on the responder's behavior. The key variables here are split_self (the amount offered to the participant), token_self and token_opp (their contributions), combined_earning, and trial_type. The previous models have considered absolute monetary gain, fairness relative to contributions, and quadratic terms for inequity. To come up with a new model, I should think of a different psychological mechanism that hasn't been covered yet.\n\nLooking at the previous models: Model 1 uses a linear penalty for getting less than their fair share. Model 2 compares the percentage offered to their contribution percentage. Model 3 uses a quadratic term for deviations from fair share. So maybe a new angle is to consider the ratio of the offer to their contribution, or perhaps the ratio of the split to the combined earnings. Another idea is to model the utility as a function of both the absolute offer and the relative fairness compared to the opponent's contribution.\n\nWait, the trial_type variable indicates whether the contribution was equal, opponent more, or participant more. This might interact with how the responder perceives fairness. For example, if the trial_type is \"participant more\" (they contributed more), they might expect a higher share. So maybe the utility depends on the interaction between the offer and the trial type. But trial_type is a categorical variable (1,2,3), so how to incorporate that?\n\nAlternatively, the model could consider the difference between the split_self and what would be considered fair based on their contribution. The fair share would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Let's compute that. For example, if combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), since each token is \u00a33. So the fair share would be 3*token_self. Wait, combined_earning is exactly 3*(token_self + token_opp), right? Because each token is \u00a33. So the fair share is 3*token_self. But split_self is the amount offered to the participant. So the difference between split_self and 3*token_self could be a factor. But Model 1 and Model 3 already use this difference. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: the ratio of the offer to the fair share. So split_self / (3*token_self). If this ratio is less than 1, the offer is below their contribution-based fair share, which might lead to lower utility. But how to model that? Maybe a parameter that scales this ratio. For example, utility could be beta * split_self + alpha * (split_self / (3*token_self)). But that might not capture the psychological principle well. Alternatively, using a reference point where the fair share is the reference, and deviations from that affect utility. Prospect theory suggests that losses (getting less than reference) are more impactful than gains. So maybe a piecewise function where if split_self is less than fair share, there's a penalty, and if it's more, maybe a smaller bonus. But Model 1 uses a max function for the deficit. Maybe a different approach is needed.\n\nWait, the problem states that two equal split_self values don't represent the same fairness because combined_earning varies. So the same split_self could be a different proportion of the total. For example, if combined_earning is higher, split_self might be a smaller percentage even if the absolute value is the same. So perhaps the model should consider the percentage split (splitperc_self) relative to their contribution percentage. The contribution percentage is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The offered percentage is splitperc_self. The difference between these could be a fairness component. Model 2 uses this difference. So maybe that's already covered.\n\nAlternatively, the model could use the ratio of the offered percentage to the contribution percentage. For example, (splitperc_self / (token_self_percent)). If this ratio is 1, it's perfectly fair. If less than 1, unfair. So the utility could be beta * split_self + alpha * (splitperc_self / token_self_percent - 1). But this might not capture the nonlinear aspects. Or perhaps log of the ratio, which is similar to inequity aversion in some models. But that's getting complex.\n\nAnother thought: the utility could be a combination of the absolute monetary gain (split_self) and the relative gain compared to the opponent's split. For example, if the responder cares about how much they get compared to the proposer. But in the responder role, the proposer's split is split_opp. So split_self vs split_opp. But combined_earning is split_self + split_opp. So maybe the ratio of split_self to split_opp. But this might not be directly relevant if the responder is focused on their own share relative to their contribution.\n\nWait, the trial_role is 1 for responder. So when trial_role is 1, the participant is responding to an offer made by the opponent. The proposer's variables (split_opp and split_self) are the offers. So the responder's utility could depend on how the offer compares to their own contribution and the opponent's contribution. For example, if the responder contributed more (token_self > token_opp), they might expect a higher split. So the fairness component could be the difference between the offered split and their contribution-based fair share, scaled by some parameter.\n\nBut Models 1 and 3 already use the difference between split_self and 3*token_self. To differentiate, perhaps the model should include a term that compares the split percentage to the contribution percentage, but in a multiplicative way. For example, the utility could be split_self multiplied by a factor that depends on how fair the split is relative to contributions. So U = split_self * (1 + alpha * (splitperc_self - fair_percent)/100), where fair_percent is (token_self/(token_self + token_opp))*100. This way, if the split is fair, the utility is just split_self. If it's more than fair, utility increases, and if less, it decreases. The parameter alpha scales the importance of fairness relative to the monetary amount. But this introduces a multiplicative term between split_self and the fairness component. However, this might lead to parameter covariance if alpha and beta (if there's a beta) are both present. Wait, the model needs to have up to two learnable parameters. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, the utility could be a weighted sum of the absolute offer and the ratio of the offer to the fair share. For example:\n\nU = beta * split_self + alpha * (split_self / (3 * token_self))\n\nHere, beta represents the sensitivity to the absolute monetary value, and alpha represents the sensitivity to the ratio of the offer to their contribution-based fair share. If alpha is positive, getting more than the fair share (split_self > 3*token_self) increases utility, and less decreases it. But this might not capture the idea that people might be more sensitive to receiving less than their fair share. So maybe a piecewise function where the effect is different when split_self is below or above the fair share. But that would require more parameters. However, the problem allows up to two parameters. Alternatively, using a term that is split_self minus the fair share, multiplied by a parameter. But that's similar to Model 1.\n\nWait, Model 1 uses max(3*token_self - split_self, 0), which is a linear penalty for offers below the fair share. Model 3 uses a quadratic term. To differentiate, perhaps the model should consider the proportion of the fair share that the offer represents. For example, if the offer is 80% of the fair share, the disutility is proportional to the 20% deficit. So the utility could be:\n\nU = beta * split_self - alpha * ( (3 * token_self - split_self) / (3 * token_self) )\n\nThis term (3*token_self - split_self)/(3*token_self) represents the proportional deficit relative to the fair share. If split_self is less than fair share, this term is positive, leading to a penalty. If split_self is equal or more, the term is zero or negative (but since we have a minus alpha, a negative term would add to utility). Wait, but if split_self is more than fair share, then (3*token_self - split_self) is negative, so the term becomes negative, and multiplied by -alpha, it becomes positive. So this would reward offers above the fair share. But maybe responders don't care about getting more than their fair share, only about getting less. So perhaps we should take the max of (fair share - split_self, 0) divided by fair share. Then the term is only active when split_self is below fair share. So:\n\nU = beta * split_self - alpha * ( max(3*token_self - split_self, 0) / (3*token_self) )\n\nThis way, the disutility is proportional to the percentage deficit relative to the fair share. For example, if the fair share is \u00a310 and the offer is \u00a38, the deficit is \u00a32, which is 20% of the fair share. The penalty would be alpha * 0.2. This captures the idea that people are sensitive to the relative amount they're losing compared to their fair share, not just the absolute amount. This could be a different psychological mechanism than the previous models. The parameters beta and alpha would represent the sensitivity to absolute gains and relative deficit, respectively. This model would have two learnable parameters, which fits the requirement.\n\nAnother consideration is the combined_earning. Since combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), but the model already uses token_self, maybe that's sufficient. The key is that the model uses variables available in the dataset. The variables used here are split_self and token_self, which are present.\n\nNow, checking the previous models: Model 1 uses max(3*token_self - split_self, 0), which is the absolute deficit. This model uses the relative deficit (as a proportion of fair share). So this is a different approach. The parameters here would capture how much the responder cares about the absolute amount (beta) versus the proportional loss (alpha). This could help in parameter recovery since the two terms are in different units (absolute vs relative), reducing covariance.\n\nThe mathematical model would then be:\n\nU_accept = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * ( max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0) / (3 * token_self) )\n\nHere, \u03b2 is the weight on the absolute monetary gain, and \u03b1 is the weight on the proportional deficit relative to the fair share. The max function ensures that only deficits (offers below fair share) are penalized. Offers above fair share do not contribute to the penalty term.\n\nNow, checking the constraints: the model uses only variables present in the dataset (split_self, token_self). It has two learnable parameters (alpha and beta), which need to have finite bounds. For alpha and beta, since they are weights, they can be constrained to be positive. For example, beta could be in [0, 10] and alpha in [0, 20]. The exact bounds can be generous but finite. The utility can be any real number.\n\nAnother consideration: if token_self is zero, division by zero occurs. But in the task, participants have a pretask where they find tokens, so token_self is at least 1? The dataset's token_self is int64, so possible values are non-negative. But if token_self is zero, the fair share is zero, which might not make sense. However, in the experiment, participants must have contributed some tokens, so token_self is likely always positive. So the denominator is safe.\n\nVariable descriptions:\n\n- \u03b2 (beta): Learnable parameter representing sensitivity to absolute monetary gain. Range [0, 10], inclusive.\n- \u03b1 (alpha): Learnable parameter representing sensitivity to proportional deficit relative to fair share. Range [0, 20], inclusive.\n- split_self: From data, the proposed share for the participant.\n- token_self: From data, the participant's tokens.\n\nThe utility is calculated as \u03b2 multiplied by split_self minus \u03b1 multiplied by the proportional deficit (if any). This model captures both the direct monetary incentive and the aversion to receiving less than their contribution-based fair share, scaled by how much they're missing proportionally.\n\nThis model meets all the requirements: two learnable parameters, uses dataset variables, focuses on responder behavior, builds on psychological principles (inequity aversion with proportional loss), and avoids parameters for stochasticity. The parameters are likely to have lower covariance because one is in absolute terms and the other in relative terms.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = beta * split_self - alpha * (max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0) / (3 * token_self))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to absolute monetary gain\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to proportional deficit relative to fair share\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed monetary amount for participant (in \u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens contributed by participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA dual-component utility model combining absolute monetary value with aversion to proportional deficits relative to contribution-based fairness.
