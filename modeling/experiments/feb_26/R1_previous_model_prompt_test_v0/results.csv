1,,"U_accept = beta * split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)","A utility model capturing trade-offs between absolute monetary gain and aversion to receiving less than one's contribution-based fair share. The utility combines a weighted monetary value (beta * split_self) with a penalty for deficits relative to the fair share (alpha * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)). Two learnable parameters (alpha and beta) govern sensitivity to fairness and monetary value, respectively. The model reflects inequity aversion principles while maintaining identifiability through distinct parameter roles.",v0,0.8463656815850865,0.8041029796088481
2,,U_accept = beta * split_self + alpha * (splitperc_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100),"A dual-component utility model combining absolute monetary value (split_self) and proportional fairness relative to contributions. The fairness component compares the offered percentage (splitperc_self) to the contribution-based fair percentage [(token_self/(token_self+token_opp))*100]. Two learnable parameters (beta, alpha) capture sensitivity to monetary gains and equity considerations respectively, enabling simultaneous modeling of self-interest and contribution-based inequity aversion.",v0,0.8971456942255881,0.8148233710157532
3,,U_accept = beta * split_self - alpha * (split_self - 3 * token_self)^2,"A quadratic utility model combining absolute monetary value with aversion to deviations from contribution-based fairness. The utility function penalizes both advantageous and disadvantageous inequity relative to the participant's fair share (3 * token_self). Two parameters control sensitivity to money (beta) and fairness deviations (alpha), capturing tension between self-interest and nonlinear equity preferences. The quadratic term reflects stronger aversion to large inequities than linear models.",v0,0.774832508397215,0.6519976718469853
4,,"U_accept = beta * split_self - alpha * (max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0) / (3 * token_self))","A dual-component utility model combining absolute monetary value with aversion to proportional deficits relative to contribution-based fairness. The utility function weights the offered amount (split_self) by a sensitivity parameter (beta) and subtracts a penalty term for offers below the participant's fair share (3*token_self). The penalty scales with the proportional deficit [(fair_share - offer)/fair_share], controlled by parameter alpha. This captures both self-interest and nonlinear sensitivity to relative fairness violations while maintaining parameter identifiability through distinct scaling of absolute vs proportional terms.",v0,0.8314788482710986,0.7124062197713773
5,,U_accept = beta * split_self + alpha * (split_self - 3 * token_self) / (3 * token_self),"A utility model combining absolute monetary gains with proportional deviations from contribution-based fairness. The utility function weights the offered amount (split_self) and the proportional difference between the offer and the participant's fair share (3*token_self). Two parameters (beta, alpha) govern sensitivity to monetary value and proportional equity considerations, capturing trade-offs between self-interest and nonlinear responses to fairness violations relative to contributions.",v0,0.5706868554456155,0.4767607147368688
