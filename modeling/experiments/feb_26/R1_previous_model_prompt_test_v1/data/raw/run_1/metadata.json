      "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts the utility of accepting an offer for a responder in the given experiment. The model needs to be based on psychological principles, use the dataset variables appropriately, and have no more than two learnable parameters. Also, it should avoid parameters for stochasticity since that's handled later with a temperature parameter.\n\nFirst, I need to focus on the responder's behavior. The key variables here are the proposed splits (split_self and split_opp), the tokens found by self and opponent (token_self and token_opp), and the combined_earning. The trial_type might also play a role, but maybe it's captured through the token variables.\n\nPsychological principles that might be relevant here include fairness considerations, inequity aversion, and reciprocity. Since the model should predict the utility of accepting, fairness is a likely candidate. People often compare their share to what they perceive as fair. \n\nIn this experiment, the combined_earning is the total money, which is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So each token is worth \u00a33. The split_self is the amount offered to the participant (responder), and split_opp is the proposer's share. A fair split might be based on the contributions (tokens found) of each party. For example, if the participant found more tokens, they might expect a larger share proportional to their contribution.\n\nSo, the fair share for the participant would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Let's call this the \"expected fair share.\" The utility of accepting could depend on how much the proposed split (split_self) deviates from this fair share. If the split is more than fair, utility increases; if less, utility decreases.\n\nAnother factor could be the absolute amount offered. Even if the split is unfair, a higher absolute amount might still have positive utility. So maybe the utility is a combination of the absolute offer and the deviation from the fair share.\n\nBut the problem states that two equal split_self values don't represent the same fairness because combined_earning varies. So the model must account for the proportion relative to contributions. \n\nLet me formalize this. The fair share based on contribution is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. The actual split_self is the proposed amount. The difference between split_self and the fair share could be a term in the utility. Let's call this difference \u0394. \n\nBut maybe people have different sensitivities to this difference. So a parameter \u03b1 could weight how much this deviation affects utility. Also, the absolute split_self might be another term. So utility U = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the utility is split_self minus some penalty for unfairness. The penalty could be based on the difference between the proposed split and the fair split. For example, U = split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_share - split_self, 0). This would penalize offers below the fair share. But this might not capture cases where the offer is above fair, which could be positive. \n\nWait, the model should predict the utility of accepting. If the offer is more than fair, that's a positive, but maybe people still have a sensitivity to overcompensation? Or maybe they just care about being treated fairly, so any deviation (positive or negative) could be a factor. But perhaps the responder's main concern is when they are getting less than their fair share. \n\nAlternatively, using inequity aversion as in Fehr & Schmidt (1999), where people dislike unequal outcomes. But in this case, the inequity is not just about the split but relative to contributions. So the model should compare the split to the contribution-based fair share.\n\nSo, the utility could be a function of the proposed split (split_self) and the difference between split_self and the fair share. Let's model this as:\n\nU = split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share)\n\nBut if split_self is less than fair_share, then (split_self - fair_share) is negative, reducing utility. The parameter \u03b1 would determine how much the deviation from fairness affects utility. If \u03b1 is positive, then getting more than fair increases utility, which might not make sense. Wait, maybe \u03b1 should be negative if the person dislikes deviations from fairness. Wait, no. Let's think again.\n\nSuppose fair_share is the expected amount. If the split_self is higher than fair_share, that's a bonus. If lower, a penalty. But maybe people are only averse to being below the fair share. So the utility could be split_self + \u03b1 * max(fair_share - split_self, 0). Here, \u03b1 is a penalty parameter for being below the fair share. If split_self is less than fair_share, the term (fair_share - split_self) is positive, multiplied by \u03b1 (which could be positive, leading to a negative impact on utility). Wait, but the model is U = split_self - \u03b1 * (fair_share - split_self) when split_self < fair_share. So if split_self is less than fair_share, the utility is reduced by \u03b1 times the deficit. If split_self is equal or more, then the penalty term is zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe people have a linear sensitivity to the difference. So U = split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share). If \u03b1 is positive, then getting more than fair_share increases utility. But maybe \u03b1 is negative, so that getting less than fair_share reduces utility. Wait, perhaps the model should be U = split_self - \u03b1 * (fair_share - split_self). Let's rearrange that: U = split_self - \u03b1*(fair_share - split_self) = split_self*(1 + \u03b1) - \u03b1*fair_share. Hmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the utility could be split_self minus the difference between fair_share and split_self, scaled by \u03b1. So U = split_self - \u03b1*(fair_share - split_self). If split_self is less than fair_share, this term is positive (since fair_share - split_self is positive), so the utility is reduced by \u03b1 times that difference. If split_self is more than fair_share, then the term becomes negative, so the utility is increased by \u03b1 times the excess. But maybe people don't care about getting more than fair, only about being shortchanged. So the penalty is only when split_self < fair_share. \n\nIn that case, the model could be U = split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_share - split_self, 0). Here, \u03b1 is a parameter that scales the penalty for being below the fair share. If \u03b1 is positive, then the penalty reduces utility. So higher \u03b1 means more sensitivity to unfairness (i.e., lower offers below fair are more aversive). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the model should consider the ratio instead of the absolute difference. For example, (split_self / fair_share) - 1. If split_self is less than fair_share, this ratio is negative. So U = split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self / fair_share - 1). But this might complicate things. \n\nBut the problem states that the combined_earning can vary, so the same split_self in different trials might have different fairness implications. Therefore, the model must account for the relative contribution. \n\nAnother angle: the participant's contribution is token_self, and the opponent's is token_opp. The fair split would be proportional to their contributions. So split_self should be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Let's call this fair_share. The difference between split_self and fair_share is the unfairness. \n\nSo the utility could be split_self (the monetary gain) plus a term that captures the fairness. If the split is fair, that term is zero. If it's unfair, the term is negative. So perhaps U = split_self - \u03b1 * |split_self - fair_share|. But absolute value might not capture direction. Alternatively, if people are only averse to being undercompensated, then U = split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_share - split_self, 0). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the utility is split_self multiplied by a fairness term. For example, U = split_self * (1 + \u03b1 * (split_self / fair_share - 1)). If split_self is equal to fair_share, the term is 1, so U = split_self. If split_self is higher, the term increases utility; if lower, decreases. But this introduces a multiplicative effect. \n\nBut the problem requires the model to have no more than two learnable parameters. Let's think of the simplest form. \n\nLet me consider two possible parameters: \n\n1. \u03b1: sensitivity to fairness (how much deviations from fair share affect utility)\n2. \u03b2: sensitivity to the absolute amount offered.\n\nBut the problem says the model should have up to two parameters. So maybe U = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share). \n\nBut this would have two parameters. Alternatively, if we set \u03b2=1 (fixed), then U = split_self + \u03b1*(split_self - fair_share). But then \u03b1 is the only parameter. But the problem allows up to two. Wait, the user says \"no more than two learnable parameters\". So maybe two parameters are acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the model should have one parameter for fairness and another for something else. But given the constraints, maybe two parameters are better. \n\nWait, the example given in the problem had two learnable parameters (beta and epsilon). So perhaps here, two parameters are acceptable. \n\nLet me think again. The utility could be a combination of the monetary gain (split_self) and the fairness term. So:\n\nU = \u03b8 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share)\n\nHere, \u03b8 is the weight on the monetary gain, and \u03b1 is the weight on the fairness term. But maybe \u03b8 is fixed to 1, as the utility is in monetary terms. Then U = split_self + \u03b1*(split_self - fair_share). But this would be equivalent to U = split_self*(1 + \u03b1) - \u03b1*fair_share. Alternatively, if \u03b8 is a learnable parameter, then U = \u03b8 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share). But this would have two parameters. \n\nBut maybe \u03b8 can be set to 1, assuming that the utility is linear in the monetary amount. Then \u03b1 captures the additional effect of fairness. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the model should have two parameters: one for the weight on the split_self, and another for the weight on the fairness deviation. But that might lead to high covariance between parameters. The problem mentions that the model should be considerate of high covariance between parameters for parameter recovery. So perhaps combining them into a single parameter. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the model is U = split_self - \u03b1 * (fair_share - split_self). This can be rewritten as U = split_self*(1 + \u03b1) - \u03b1*fair_share. Here, \u03b1 is a single parameter. If \u03b1 is positive, then the utility increases when split_self is higher than fair_share. But if split_self is lower than fair_share, the term (fair_share - split_self) is positive, so the utility is reduced by \u03b1 times that. \n\nBut this might not capture the case where people are only sensitive to being below the fair share. So maybe the model should have a term that is only active when split_self < fair_share. \n\nSo U = split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_share - split_self, 0). Here, \u03b1 is a parameter that scales the penalty for being below the fair share. If split_self is equal to or above fair_share, the penalty term is zero. So the utility is just split_self. If it's below, then utility is split_self minus \u03b1 times the deficit. \n\nThis model has one learnable parameter (\u03b1). But the problem allows up to two. Maybe adding another parameter, like a baseline acceptance bias. For example, U = \u03b2 + split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_share - split_self, 0). Here, \u03b2 is a baseline utility for accepting (maybe capturing a general tendency to accept offers regardless of fairness). But the problem states that the model should not include parameters for general stochasticity, but \u03b2 here is a fixed bias. However, the problem says the model should not include parameters to simulate general stochasticity, which is handled by a temperature parameter later. So \u03b2 could be a learnable parameter. \n\nBut the problem says the model should have no more than two learnable parameters. So if we have \u03b1 and \u03b2, that's two. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the model should have only one parameter. Let's see. \n\nIf we set \u03b2=0, then U = split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_share - split_self, 0). This model has one parameter (\u03b1). But maybe participants have different baseline propensities to accept, so \u03b2 could be useful. However, the problem says the model should predict the utility of the action (accepting), so perhaps the baseline is not needed. Because when comparing the utility of accept vs. reject, the baseline would cancel out. Wait, but the user says not to include the model for rejecting. So the utility is only for accepting. If the utility is higher, the probability of accepting is higher. So a baseline \u03b2 could represent a general tendency to accept. For example, even if the offer is bad, if \u03b2 is high, the utility is higher. But maybe that's not necessary. \n\nAlternatively, the model could be U = split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self / fair_share). Here, \u03b1 is a parameter that scales the effect of the ratio. If split_self is equal to fair_share, then the term is split_self + \u03b1 * 1. If split_self is higher, the ratio is greater than 1, increasing utility. If lower, the ratio is less than 1, decreasing utility. But this introduces a multiplicative effect. \n\nBut perhaps the simplest model with one parameter is U = split_self - \u03b1 * (fair_share - split_self). This can be rewritten as U = split_self*(1 + \u03b1) - \u03b1*fair_share. Here, \u03b1 is a learnable parameter. If \u03b1 is positive, then the utility increases when split_self is higher than fair_share, and decreases when it's lower. If \u03b1 is zero, utility is just split_self. \n\nBut maybe participants are only sensitive to being below the fair share. So the model should penalize only when split_self < fair_share. Hence, using max(fair_share - split_self, 0). \n\nSo, the model would be:\n\nU = split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_share - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b1 is the penalty for each unit below the fair share. If the offer is equal to or above fair_share, the utility is just split_self. If it's below, then the utility is reduced by \u03b1 times the deficit. \n\nThis model has one learnable parameter (\u03b1). But the problem allows up to two. Maybe adding another parameter, like a weight on the split_self term. For example:\n\nU = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_share - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b2 is the weight on the monetary gain, and \u03b1 is the penalty for unfairness. This would allow for participants who value money more (higher \u03b2) and are more sensitive to unfairness (higher \u03b1). But this introduces two parameters. However, these parameters might be correlated. For example, if \u03b2 is high, even a small \u03b1 could lead to higher utility. But parameter recovery might be challenging if \u03b2 and \u03b1 are highly correlated. \n\nAlternatively, setting \u03b2=1 (fixed) and having \u03b1 as a learnable parameter. That way, only one parameter. But the problem allows up to two. \n\nThe problem states that the model should have no more than two learnable parameters. So perhaps using two parameters is acceptable. \n\nAnother angle: the utility could be based on the ratio of the proposed split to the fair share. For example, U = \u03b2 * (split_self / fair_share) + \u03b1 * split_self. But this might not capture the absolute value. \n\nAlternatively, combining both the absolute and relative terms. For example, U = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self / fair_share). This would have two parameters. \n\nBut perhaps the key is to model the utility as a combination of the monetary value and the fairness relative to contribution. \n\nAnother consideration is that the combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So fair_share is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 3*(token_self + token_opp) ) = 3 * token_self. Wait, that's interesting. Because combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so the fair_share based on contribution is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning = 3 * token_self. So the fair_share is simply 3 * token_self. \n\nWait, that's a key insight! Because combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so the fair_share based on contribution is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 3*(token_self + token_opp) ) = 3 * token_self. So regardless of the opponent's tokens, the fair_share is exactly 3 * token_self. \n\nThat's a crucial point. So the fair_share is fixed as 3 * token_self. Therefore, the split_self (the amount offered to the participant) should be compared to 3 * token_self. \n\nThis simplifies the model. So the fair_share is 3 * token_self. Therefore, the difference between split_self and fair_share is split_self - 3 * token_self. \n\nSo the utility could be modeled as:\n\nU = split_self - \u03b1 * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b1 is the penalty for each pound below the fair share (3 * token_self). If the offered split_self is less than 3 * token_self, the participant experiences a disutility proportional to the deficit. \n\nAlternatively, the model could use the ratio of split_self to fair_share. For example:\n\nU = split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self / (3 * token_self) - 1)\n\nBut this might not be as intuitive. \n\nBut given that the fair_share is 3 * token_self, the model can be simplified. \n\nSo the utility of accepting is the offered amount (split_self) minus a penalty for any deficit relative to the fair share (3 * token_self). The penalty is scaled by \u03b1. \n\nThis model has one learnable parameter (\u03b1). But the problem allows up to two. Maybe adding another parameter, like a weight on the split_self term. For example:\n\nU = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b2 is the weight on the monetary gain, and \u03b1 is the penalty for being below the fair share. This allows for participants who might value money more (higher \u03b2) and/or are more sensitive to unfairness (higher \u03b1). \n\nBut introducing two parameters might complicate parameter recovery if they are correlated. However, the problem states that the model should be considerate of high covariance between parameters. So perhaps using a single parameter is better. \n\nAlternatively, if \u03b2 is fixed to 1, then U = split_self - \u03b1 * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0). This model has one parameter. \n\nBut the problem allows up to two parameters. Let's think of another factor. Maybe the participant also considers the opponent's share relative to their contribution. For example, if the opponent's split_opp is more than their fair share (3 * token_opp), that could also affect utility. But this complicates the model and adds more variables, which might not be necessary. \n\nAlternatively, the model could include a term for the difference between the opponent's split and their fair share. But that would require more parameters. \n\nGiven the dataset variables, the key variables for the responder are split_self, token_self, and token_opp (which determines fair_share). \n\nBut given that fair_share is 3 * token_self, the model can be simplified. \n\nSo the model could be:\n\nU = split_self - \u03b1 * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nThis captures the idea that the utility is the offered amount minus a penalty for any amount below the fair share. The parameter \u03b1 determines how much each unit below the fair share reduces utility. \n\nThis model uses only one learnable parameter (\u03b1). But the problem allows up to two. Maybe adding another parameter, such as a sensitivity to the absolute offer. For example:\n\nU = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b2 is the weight on the split_self, and \u03b1 is the penalty for being below fair. This allows for participants who might not linearly value the split_self (e.g., diminishing returns) but since the model is linear, \u03b2 can scale it. However, if \u03b2 is a learnable parameter, then we have two parameters. \n\nBut the problem states that the model should have no more than two learnable parameters. So this is acceptable. \n\nBut why would \u03b2 not be 1? Because perhaps participants have different marginal utilities for money. For example, some people might value each pound more than others. So \u03b2 scales the monetary term. \n\nIncluding \u03b2 allows the model to account for individual differences in how much monetary gain is valued, while \u03b1 captures sensitivity to unfairness. \n\nSo the model would be:\n\nU = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nThis model has two learnable parameters: \u03b2 and \u03b1. \n\nBut we need to ensure that these parameters are bounded. For example, \u03b2 should be positive, as higher split_self should increase utility. Similarly, \u03b1 should be non-negative, as a higher penalty for unfairness reduces utility. \n\nThe ranges could be:\n\n\u03b2: [0, some upper bound, say 10], since it's a scaling factor on split_self.\n\n\u03b1: [0, some upper bound, say 10], as it's a penalty per unit deficit.\n\nBut the problem says the bounds should be generous. So maybe \u03b2: [0, 10], inclusive. \u03b1: [0, 10], inclusive. \n\nAlternatively, \u03b2 could be allowed to be negative, but that would imply that higher split_self reduces utility, which doesn't make sense. So \u03b2 should be constrained to be non-negative. \n\nSo the variables would be:\n\n- \u03b2: learnable, range [0, 10], inclusive.\n- \u03b1: learnable, range [0, 10], inclusive.\n\nBut the problem says the model should have no more than two learnable parameters. This model has two, which is acceptable. \n\nAnother consideration: the model should use variables available in the dataset. The variables used here are split_self and token_self, which are present. \n\nSo the final model is:\n\nU = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nThis model uses two learnable parameters (\u03b2 and \u03b1) and the dataset variables split_self and token_self. \n\nNow, checking against the requirements:\n\n1. Predicts responder behavior: Yes, as it's based on the responder's split and their contribution.\n2. Builds on psychological principles: Yes, fairness based on contribution and inequity aversion.\n3. Considerate of high covariance: Using two parameters (\u03b2 and \u03b1) that might be correlated, but with proper bounds and model structure, parameter recovery is possible.\n4. Applicable to the dataset: Uses split_self and token_self, which are available.\n5. No stochasticity parameters: Correct, the model is deterministic.\n6. Two learnable parameters: Yes.\n7. Utility can be negative: Yes, if the penalty term outweighs the split_self term.\n\nThus, this model seems to meet all the requirements.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = beta * split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Marginal utility of monetary gain from accepted offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Penalty per unit deficit below contribution-based fair share (3 * token_self)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed monetary amount for the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant in pretask\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA fairness-adjusted utility model where acceptance utility depends on both the absolute monetary offer and a penalty for offers below the contribution-based fair share (3 * token_self).

This captures trade-offs between self-interest and fairness concerns.",
  "full_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts the utility of accepting an offer for a responder in the given experiment. The model needs to be based on psychological principles, use the dataset variables appropriately, and have no more than two learnable parameters. Also, it should avoid parameters for stochasticity since that's handled later with a temperature parameter.\n\nFirst, I need to focus on the responder's behavior. The key variables here are the proposed splits (split_self and split_opp), the tokens found by self and opponent (token_self and token_opp), and the combined_earning. The trial_type might also play a role, but maybe it's captured through the token variables.\n\nPsychological principles that might be relevant here include fairness considerations, inequity aversion, and reciprocity. Since the model should predict the utility of accepting, fairness is a likely candidate. People often compare their share to what they perceive as fair. \n\nIn this experiment, the combined_earning is the total money, which is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So each token is worth \u00a33. The split_self is the amount offered to the participant (responder), and split_opp is the proposer's share. A fair split might be based on the contributions (tokens found) of each party. For example, if the participant found more tokens, they might expect a larger share proportional to their contribution.\n\nSo, the fair share for the participant would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Let's call this the \"expected fair share.\" The utility of accepting could depend on how much the proposed split (split_self) deviates from this fair share. If the split is more than fair, utility increases; if less, utility decreases.\n\nAnother factor could be the absolute amount offered. Even if the split is unfair, a higher absolute amount might still have positive utility. So maybe the utility is a combination of the absolute offer and the deviation from the fair share.\n\nBut the problem states that two equal split_self values don't represent the same fairness because combined_earning varies. So the model must account for the proportion relative to contributions. \n\nLet me formalize this. The fair share based on contribution is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. The actual split_self is the proposed amount. The difference between split_self and the fair share could be a term in the utility. Let's call this difference \u0394. \n\nBut maybe people have different sensitivities to this difference. So a parameter \u03b1 could weight how much this deviation affects utility. Also, the absolute split_self might be another term. So utility U = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the utility is split_self minus some penalty for unfairness. The penalty could be based on the difference between the proposed split and the fair split. For example, U = split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_share - split_self, 0). This would penalize offers below the fair share. But this might not capture cases where the offer is above fair, which could be positive. \n\nWait, the model should predict the utility of accepting. If the offer is more than fair, that's a positive, but maybe people still have a sensitivity to overcompensation? Or maybe they just care about being treated fairly, so any deviation (positive or negative) could be a factor. But perhaps the responder's main concern is when they are getting less than their fair share. \n\nAlternatively, using inequity aversion as in Fehr & Schmidt (1999), where people dislike unequal outcomes. But in this case, the inequity is not just about the split but relative to contributions. So the model should compare the split to the contribution-based fair share.\n\nSo, the utility could be a function of the proposed split (split_self) and the difference between split_self and the fair share. Let's model this as:\n\nU = split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share)\n\nBut if split_self is less than fair_share, then (split_self - fair_share) is negative, reducing utility. The parameter \u03b1 would determine how much the deviation from fairness affects utility. If \u03b1 is positive, then getting more than fair increases utility, which might not make sense. Wait, maybe \u03b1 should be negative if the person dislikes deviations from fairness. Wait, no. Let's think again.\n\nSuppose fair_share is the expected amount. If the split_self is higher than fair_share, that's a bonus. If lower, a penalty. But maybe people are only averse to being below the fair share. So the utility could be split_self + \u03b1 * max(fair_share - split_self, 0). Here, \u03b1 is a penalty parameter for being below the fair share. If split_self is less than fair_share, the term (fair_share - split_self) is positive, multiplied by \u03b1 (which could be positive, leading to a negative impact on utility). Wait, but the model is U = split_self - \u03b1 * (fair_share - split_self) when split_self < fair_share. So if split_self is less than fair_share, the utility is reduced by \u03b1 times the deficit. If split_self is equal or more, then the penalty term is zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe people have a linear sensitivity to the difference. So U = split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share). If \u03b1 is positive, then getting more than fair_share increases utility. But maybe \u03b1 is negative, so that getting less than fair_share reduces utility. Wait, perhaps the model should be U = split_self - \u03b1 * (fair_share - split_self). Let's rearrange that: U = split_self - \u03b1*(fair_share - split_self) = split_self*(1 + \u03b1) - \u03b1*fair_share. Hmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the utility could be split_self minus the difference between fair_share and split_self, scaled by \u03b1. So U = split_self - \u03b1*(fair_share - split_self). If split_self is less than fair_share, this term is positive (since fair_share - split_self is positive), so the utility is reduced by \u03b1 times that difference. If split_self is more than fair_share, then the term becomes negative, so the utility is increased by \u03b1 times the excess. But maybe people don't care about getting more than fair, only about being shortchanged. So the penalty is only when split_self < fair_share. \n\nIn that case, the model could be U = split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_share - split_self, 0). Here, \u03b1 is a parameter that scales the penalty for being below the fair share. If \u03b1 is positive, then the penalty reduces utility. So higher \u03b1 means more sensitivity to unfairness (i.e., lower offers below fair are more aversive). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the model should consider the ratio instead of the absolute difference. For example, (split_self / fair_share) - 1. If split_self is less than fair_share, this ratio is negative. So U = split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self / fair_share - 1). But this might complicate things. \n\nBut the problem states that the combined_earning can vary, so the same split_self in different trials might have different fairness implications. Therefore, the model must account for the relative contribution. \n\nAnother angle: the participant's contribution is token_self, and the opponent's is token_opp. The fair split would be proportional to their contributions. So split_self should be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Let's call this fair_share. The difference between split_self and fair_share is the unfairness. \n\nSo the utility could be split_self (the monetary gain) plus a term that captures the fairness. If the split is fair, that term is zero. If it's unfair, the term is negative. So perhaps U = split_self - \u03b1 * |split_self - fair_share|. But absolute value might not capture direction. Alternatively, if people are only averse to being undercompensated, then U = split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_share - split_self, 0). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the utility is split_self multiplied by a fairness term. For example, U = split_self * (1 + \u03b1 * (split_self / fair_share - 1)). If split_self is equal to fair_share, the term is 1, so U = split_self. If split_self is higher, the term increases utility; if lower, decreases. But this introduces a multiplicative effect. \n\nBut the problem requires the model to have no more than two learnable parameters. Let's think of the simplest form. \n\nLet me consider two possible parameters: \n\n1. \u03b1: sensitivity to fairness (how much deviations from fair share affect utility)\n2. \u03b2: sensitivity to the absolute amount offered.\n\nBut the problem says the model should have up to two parameters. So maybe U = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share). \n\nBut this would have two parameters. Alternatively, if we set \u03b2=1 (fixed), then U = split_self + \u03b1*(split_self - fair_share). But then \u03b1 is the only parameter. But the problem allows up to two. Wait, the user says \"no more than two learnable parameters\". So maybe two parameters are acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the model should have one parameter for fairness and another for something else. But given the constraints, maybe two parameters are better. \n\nWait, the example given in the problem had two learnable parameters (beta and epsilon). So perhaps here, two parameters are acceptable. \n\nLet me think again. The utility could be a combination of the monetary gain (split_self) and the fairness term. So:\n\nU = \u03b8 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share)\n\nHere, \u03b8 is the weight on the monetary gain, and \u03b1 is the weight on the fairness term. But maybe \u03b8 is fixed to 1, as the utility is in monetary terms. Then U = split_self + \u03b1*(split_self - fair_share). But this would be equivalent to U = split_self*(1 + \u03b1) - \u03b1*fair_share. Alternatively, if \u03b8 is a learnable parameter, then U = \u03b8 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self - fair_share). But this would have two parameters. \n\nBut maybe \u03b8 can be set to 1, assuming that the utility is linear in the monetary amount. Then \u03b1 captures the additional effect of fairness. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the model should have two parameters: one for the weight on the split_self, and another for the weight on the fairness deviation. But that might lead to high covariance between parameters. The problem mentions that the model should be considerate of high covariance between parameters for parameter recovery. So perhaps combining them into a single parameter. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the model is U = split_self - \u03b1 * (fair_share - split_self). This can be rewritten as U = split_self*(1 + \u03b1) - \u03b1*fair_share. Here, \u03b1 is a single parameter. If \u03b1 is positive, then the utility increases when split_self is higher than fair_share. But if split_self is lower than fair_share, the term (fair_share - split_self) is positive, so the utility is reduced by \u03b1 times that. \n\nBut this might not capture the case where people are only sensitive to being below the fair share. So maybe the model should have a term that is only active when split_self < fair_share. \n\nSo U = split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_share - split_self, 0). Here, \u03b1 is a parameter that scales the penalty for being below the fair share. If split_self is equal to or above fair_share, the penalty term is zero. So the utility is just split_self. If it's below, then utility is split_self minus \u03b1 times the deficit. \n\nThis model has one learnable parameter (\u03b1). But the problem allows up to two. Maybe adding another parameter, like a baseline acceptance bias. For example, U = \u03b2 + split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_share - split_self, 0). Here, \u03b2 is a baseline utility for accepting (maybe capturing a general tendency to accept offers regardless of fairness). But the problem states that the model should not include parameters for general stochasticity, but \u03b2 here is a fixed bias. However, the problem says the model should not include parameters to simulate general stochasticity, which is handled by a temperature parameter later. So \u03b2 could be a learnable parameter. \n\nBut the problem says the model should have no more than two learnable parameters. So if we have \u03b1 and \u03b2, that's two. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the model should have only one parameter. Let's see. \n\nIf we set \u03b2=0, then U = split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_share - split_self, 0). This model has one parameter (\u03b1). But maybe participants have different baseline propensities to accept, so \u03b2 could be useful. However, the problem says the model should predict the utility of the action (accepting), so perhaps the baseline is not needed. Because when comparing the utility of accept vs. reject, the baseline would cancel out. Wait, but the user says not to include the model for rejecting. So the utility is only for accepting. If the utility is higher, the probability of accepting is higher. So a baseline \u03b2 could represent a general tendency to accept. For example, even if the offer is bad, if \u03b2 is high, the utility is higher. But maybe that's not necessary. \n\nAlternatively, the model could be U = split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self / fair_share). Here, \u03b1 is a parameter that scales the effect of the ratio. If split_self is equal to fair_share, then the term is split_self + \u03b1 * 1. If split_self is higher, the ratio is greater than 1, increasing utility. If lower, the ratio is less than 1, decreasing utility. But this introduces a multiplicative effect. \n\nBut perhaps the simplest model with one parameter is U = split_self - \u03b1 * (fair_share - split_self). This can be rewritten as U = split_self*(1 + \u03b1) - \u03b1*fair_share. Here, \u03b1 is a learnable parameter. If \u03b1 is positive, then the utility increases when split_self is higher than fair_share, and decreases when it's lower. If \u03b1 is zero, utility is just split_self. \n\nBut maybe participants are only sensitive to being below the fair share. So the model should penalize only when split_self < fair_share. Hence, using max(fair_share - split_self, 0). \n\nSo, the model would be:\n\nU = split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_share - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b1 is the penalty for each unit below the fair share. If the offer is equal to or above fair_share, the utility is just split_self. If it's below, then the utility is reduced by \u03b1 times the deficit. \n\nThis model has one learnable parameter (\u03b1). But the problem allows up to two. Maybe adding another parameter, like a weight on the split_self term. For example:\n\nU = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_share - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b2 is the weight on the monetary gain, and \u03b1 is the penalty for unfairness. This would allow for participants who value money more (higher \u03b2) and are more sensitive to unfairness (higher \u03b1). But this introduces two parameters. However, these parameters might be correlated. For example, if \u03b2 is high, even a small \u03b1 could lead to higher utility. But parameter recovery might be challenging if \u03b2 and \u03b1 are highly correlated. \n\nAlternatively, setting \u03b2=1 (fixed) and having \u03b1 as a learnable parameter. That way, only one parameter. But the problem allows up to two. \n\nThe problem states that the model should have no more than two learnable parameters. So perhaps using two parameters is acceptable. \n\nAnother angle: the utility could be based on the ratio of the proposed split to the fair share. For example, U = \u03b2 * (split_self / fair_share) + \u03b1 * split_self. But this might not capture the absolute value. \n\nAlternatively, combining both the absolute and relative terms. For example, U = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self / fair_share). This would have two parameters. \n\nBut perhaps the key is to model the utility as a combination of the monetary value and the fairness relative to contribution. \n\nAnother consideration is that the combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So fair_share is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 3*(token_self + token_opp) ) = 3 * token_self. Wait, that's interesting. Because combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so the fair_share based on contribution is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning = 3 * token_self. So the fair_share is simply 3 * token_self. \n\nWait, that's a key insight! Because combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so the fair_share based on contribution is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 3*(token_self + token_opp) ) = 3 * token_self. So regardless of the opponent's tokens, the fair_share is exactly 3 * token_self. \n\nThat's a crucial point. So the fair_share is fixed as 3 * token_self. Therefore, the split_self (the amount offered to the participant) should be compared to 3 * token_self. \n\nThis simplifies the model. So the fair_share is 3 * token_self. Therefore, the difference between split_self and fair_share is split_self - 3 * token_self. \n\nSo the utility could be modeled as:\n\nU = split_self - \u03b1 * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b1 is the penalty for each pound below the fair share (3 * token_self). If the offered split_self is less than 3 * token_self, the participant experiences a disutility proportional to the deficit. \n\nAlternatively, the model could use the ratio of split_self to fair_share. For example:\n\nU = split_self + \u03b1 * (split_self / (3 * token_self) - 1)\n\nBut this might not be as intuitive. \n\nBut given that the fair_share is 3 * token_self, the model can be simplified. \n\nSo the utility of accepting is the offered amount (split_self) minus a penalty for any deficit relative to the fair share (3 * token_self). The penalty is scaled by \u03b1. \n\nThis model has one learnable parameter (\u03b1). But the problem allows up to two. Maybe adding another parameter, like a weight on the split_self term. For example:\n\nU = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b2 is the weight on the monetary gain, and \u03b1 is the penalty for being below the fair share. This allows for participants who might value money more (higher \u03b2) and/or are more sensitive to unfairness (higher \u03b1). \n\nBut introducing two parameters might complicate parameter recovery if they are correlated. However, the problem states that the model should be considerate of high covariance between parameters. So perhaps using a single parameter is better. \n\nAlternatively, if \u03b2 is fixed to 1, then U = split_self - \u03b1 * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0). This model has one parameter. \n\nBut the problem allows up to two parameters. Let's think of another factor. Maybe the participant also considers the opponent's share relative to their contribution. For example, if the opponent's split_opp is more than their fair share (3 * token_opp), that could also affect utility. But this complicates the model and adds more variables, which might not be necessary. \n\nAlternatively, the model could include a term for the difference between the opponent's split and their fair share. But that would require more parameters. \n\nGiven the dataset variables, the key variables for the responder are split_self, token_self, and token_opp (which determines fair_share). \n\nBut given that fair_share is 3 * token_self, the model can be simplified. \n\nSo the model could be:\n\nU = split_self - \u03b1 * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nThis captures the idea that the utility is the offered amount minus a penalty for any amount below the fair share. The parameter \u03b1 determines how much each unit below the fair share reduces utility. \n\nThis model uses only one learnable parameter (\u03b1). But the problem allows up to two. Maybe adding another parameter, such as a sensitivity to the absolute offer. For example:\n\nU = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b2 is the weight on the split_self, and \u03b1 is the penalty for being below fair. This allows for participants who might not linearly value the split_self (e.g., diminishing returns) but since the model is linear, \u03b2 can scale it. However, if \u03b2 is a learnable parameter, then we have two parameters. \n\nBut the problem states that the model should have no more than two learnable parameters. So this is acceptable. \n\nBut why would \u03b2 not be 1? Because perhaps participants have different marginal utilities for money. For example, some people might value each pound more than others. So \u03b2 scales the monetary term. \n\nIncluding \u03b2 allows the model to account for individual differences in how much monetary gain is valued, while \u03b1 captures sensitivity to unfairness. \n\nSo the model would be:\n\nU = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nThis model has two learnable parameters: \u03b2 and \u03b1. \n\nBut we need to ensure that these parameters are bounded. For example, \u03b2 should be positive, as higher split_self should increase utility. Similarly, \u03b1 should be non-negative, as a higher penalty for unfairness reduces utility. \n\nThe ranges could be:\n\n\u03b2: [0, some upper bound, say 10], since it's a scaling factor on split_self.\n\n\u03b1: [0, some upper bound, say 10], as it's a penalty per unit deficit.\n\nBut the problem says the bounds should be generous. So maybe \u03b2: [0, 10], inclusive. \u03b1: [0, 10], inclusive. \n\nAlternatively, \u03b2 could be allowed to be negative, but that would imply that higher split_self reduces utility, which doesn't make sense. So \u03b2 should be constrained to be non-negative. \n\nSo the variables would be:\n\n- \u03b2: learnable, range [0, 10], inclusive.\n- \u03b1: learnable, range [0, 10], inclusive.\n\nBut the problem says the model should have no more than two learnable parameters. This model has two, which is acceptable. \n\nAnother consideration: the model should use variables available in the dataset. The variables used here are split_self and token_self, which are present. \n\nSo the final model is:\n\nU = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nThis model uses two learnable parameters (\u03b2 and \u03b1) and the dataset variables split_self and token_self. \n\nNow, checking against the requirements:\n\n1. Predicts responder behavior: Yes, as it's based on the responder's split and their contribution.\n2. Builds on psychological principles: Yes, fairness based on contribution and inequity aversion.\n3. Considerate of high covariance: Using two parameters (\u03b2 and \u03b1) that might be correlated, but with proper bounds and model structure, parameter recovery is possible.\n4. Applicable to the dataset: Uses split_self and token_self, which are available.\n5. No stochasticity parameters: Correct, the model is deterministic.\n6. Two learnable parameters: Yes.\n7. Utility can be negative: Yes, if the penalty term outweighs the split_self term.\n\nThus, this model seems to meet all the requirements.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = beta * split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Marginal utility of monetary gain from accepted offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Penalty per unit deficit below contribution-based fair share (3 * token_self)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed monetary amount for the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant in pretask\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA fairness-adjusted utility model where acceptance utility depends on both the absolute monetary offer and a penalty for offers below the contribution-based fair share (3 * token_self).
