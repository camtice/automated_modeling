      "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts the utility of accepting an offer for the responder role, based on the given dataset. The model needs to incorporate psychological principles, avoid high covariance between parameters, and use no more than two learnable parameters. Let's start by understanding the key variables and the task.\n\nFirst, the responder's decision to accept or reject an offer likely depends on factors like the fairness of the offer relative to their contribution and the opponent's contribution. The dataset includes variables like token_self (participant's tokens), token_opp (opponent's tokens), split_self (proposed share), and combined_earning. The trial_type indicates whether contributions are equal, opponent more, or participant more.\n\nPrevious models (Model 1 and 2) considered the absolute monetary gain (split_self) and a fairness component based on the participant's own contribution (3 * token_self). However, they didn't account for the opponent's contribution. A key psychological principle here might be inequity aversion, where people dislike unequal outcomes. But maybe the responder compares their share not just to their own contribution but also to the opponent's. \n\nAnother angle is the ratio of the proposed split to what's considered fair. For example, a fair split might be proportional to each person's contribution. If the participant contributed more tokens, they might expect a higher share. So, the fair share could be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. The utility might then depend on how much the proposed split_self deviates from this fair value.\n\nBut the problem states that two equal split_self values don't represent the same fairness because combined_earning varies. So, the model should account for the proportion of the total each person contributed. Let's think about the fair share as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. The proposed split_self minus this fair share would indicate over or under-offer. \n\nAlternatively, the model could use the difference between the proposed percentage (splitperc_self) and the fair percentage (token_self / (token_self + token_opp) * 100). This would normalize the fairness across different combined_earning values. For example, if the participant contributed 60% of the tokens, a 50% split would be unfair, but if they contributed 50%, 50% is fair.\n\nSo, the utility could be a function of the monetary gain (split_self) and the deviation from the fair percentage. Let's denote the fair percentage as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The deviation is splitperc_self - fair_percentage. If the split is less than fair, this would be negative, reducing utility. If it's more, positive, increasing utility. \n\nBut how to model this? Maybe a linear combination: U = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (splitperc_self - fair_percentage). Here, \u03b2 represents the sensitivity to monetary gain, and \u03b1 represents sensitivity to fairness (proportional inequity). If \u03b1 is positive, offers above the fair percentage increase utility, below decrease. But maybe participants are only averse to being under-compensated. So, perhaps a term that only penalizes when splitperc_self is less than fair. So, max(fair_percentage - splitperc_self, 0). Then, U = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_percentage - splitperc_self, 0). This way, if the offer is below fair, there's a penalty scaled by \u03b1. If it's above, no penalty. \n\nBut wait, the splitperc_self is already a percentage. The fair percentage is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. So, the difference between splitperc_self and fair_percentage is the percentage point deviation. For example, if fair is 60% and split is 50%, that's a 10% point deficit. The penalty would be 10 * \u03b1. \n\nThis approach accounts for both the absolute monetary gain (split_self) and the proportional fairness relative to contributions. The parameters \u03b2 and \u03b1 would capture the trade-off between self-interest and fairness concerns. \n\nBut the problem states that the model should not include parameters for general stochasticity (like a temperature parameter), so we focus on deterministic utility. Also, the model must have no more than two learnable parameters, which \u03b2 and \u03b1 are. \n\nNow, considering parameter recovery and covariance. If \u03b2 and \u03b1 are on different scales, they might not covary much. For example, \u03b2 scales with pounds, \u03b1 with percentage points. But if the variables are normalized, covariance could be an issue. However, since the model uses two distinct terms, each parameter might capture different aspects, reducing covariance. \n\nThe variables needed are split_self (data), token_self (data), token_opp (data), and splitperc_self (data). The fair_percentage is calculated as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The term (fair_percentage - splitperc_self) is the deficit. \n\nSo the model would be:\n\nU_accept = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_percentage - splitperc_self, 0)\n\nWhere fair_percentage is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100.\n\nThis model uses two learnable parameters (\u03b2 and \u03b1) with ranges. For \u03b2, since it's scaling the monetary value, a reasonable range could be [0, some upper bound], but since split_self can vary, maybe a larger range. However, to keep it generous, perhaps [-10, 10], allowing for negative or positive weights. But since split_self is a positive value, a negative \u03b2 would imply that higher offers reduce utility, which is unlikely. So \u03b2 should be positive. So range [0, 10]. \n\nFor \u03b1, the fairness sensitivity. The penalty term is in percentage points. If \u03b1 is positive, it penalizes offers below the fair percentage. The range could be [0, 10], as well. \n\nBut the problem says the bounds should be generous. So maybe [0, 20] for both. But let's check. For example, if split_self is \u00a310, \u03b2=1 would contribute 10. If the deficit is 10% points, \u03b1=1 would subtract 10. So the parameters need to be on a scale that allows their product with the variables to influence the utility appropriately. \n\nAlternatively, if split_self is in pounds and the deficit is in percentage points, the parameters \u03b2 and \u03b1 would have different units. So their ranges might need to be different. For example, \u03b2 could be in [0, 1] (since split_self can be up to combined_earning, which is 3*(token_self + token_opp)), but token_self and token_opp vary. However, to avoid restricting, perhaps set \u03b2 to [0, 10] and \u03b1 to [0, 10]. \n\nAnother consideration: the fair percentage could be zero if token_self is zero, but in the dataset, token_self is from a pretask, so it's possible. But the model should handle that. If token_self and token_opp are both zero, but combined_earning is zero, but that's probably not the case. \n\nIn the dataset, combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So split_self is part of that. The splitperc_self is (split_self / combined_earning)*100. So the fair percentage is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. So the deficit is (fair_percentage - splitperc_self). \n\nThis model captures the idea that participants evaluate both the absolute amount they receive and whether that amount is fair relative to their contribution. If the offer is below their fair share, they experience a utility loss proportional to the deficit. The parameters \u03b2 and \u03b1 represent the weight given to monetary gain and fairness, respectively. \n\nThis approach builds on inequity aversion but in a proportional sense rather than absolute. It also uses variables available in the dataset: token_self, token_opp, split_self, splitperc_self. \n\nNow, checking the model against the requirements:\n\n1. Predict responder behavior: Yes, as trial_role is 1 for responder.\n2. Psychological principles: Inequity aversion, proportional fairness.\n3. Low covariance: \u03b2 and \u03b1 are in different units (money vs percentage points), so covariance might be manageable.\n4. Uses dataset variables: Yes, token_self, token_opp, split_self, splitperc_self (but splitperc_self can be calculated from split_self and combined_earning, which is 3*(token_self + token_opp). However, splitperc_self is already a variable in the dataset.\n5. No stochastic parameters: Correct.\n6. Two learnable parameters: \u03b2 and \u03b1.\n\nSo the model seems to fit the requirements. Now, formalizing the model:\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = beta * split_self - alpha * max(( (token_self / (token_self + token_opp) ) * 100 - splitperc_self ), 0)\n</MODEL>\n\nBut wait, the fair percentage is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The deficit is fair_percentage - splitperc_self. So the max of that and 0. So if splitperc_self is less than fair, the deficit is positive, leading to a penalty. If it's equal or more, the penalty is zero.\n\nVariables:\n\n- beta: learnable, scaling the monetary gain.\n- alpha: learnable, scaling the fairness penalty.\n- split_self: from data.\n- token_self: from data.\n- token_opp: from data.\n- splitperc_self: from data.\n\nBut splitperc_self is redundant because it's (split_self / combined_earning)*100, and combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So split_self = (splitperc_self / 100) * 3*(token_self + token_opp). However, since splitperc_self is a variable in the dataset, we can use it directly.\n\nBut in the model, the fair percentage is calculated as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. So the model uses token_self and token_opp to compute the fair percentage, then subtracts splitperc_self. \n\nSo the variables needed are split_self, token_self, token_opp, splitperc_self. All of which are present in the dataset.\n\nNow, variable descriptions:\n\nbeta: learnable, range [0, 10], inclusive.\n\nalpha: learnable, range [0, 10], inclusive.\n\nsplit_self: data variable, source data.\n\ntoken_self: data variable.\n\ntoken_opp: data variable.\n\nsplitperc_self: data variable.\n\nThe max term is calculated, not a learnable parameter.\n\nSo the variables section would list beta and alpha as learnable, with their ranges. The other variables are from data or calculated.\n\nNow, the JSON structure:\n\nFor each variable in the model:\n\n- U_accept: calculated, range -inf to inf.\n- beta: learnable, min 0, max 10, inclusive.\n- alpha: learnable, min 0, max 10, inclusive.\n- split_self: data, source data.\n- token_self: data.\n- token_opp: data.\n- splitperc_self: data.\n\nBut in the model formula, the max function uses (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100 - splitperc_self. So splitperc_self is part of the calculation. However, splitperc_self is a variable in the dataset, so we can use it directly. Wait, no: the fair percentage is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. splitperc_self is the proposed percentage. So the term is (fair_percentage - splitperc_self). So the model uses token_self, token_opp, and splitperc_self from the data.\n\nBut in the dataset, splitperc_self is provided. So the model can directly use that variable. Wait, no: the fair percentage is calculated from token_self and token_opp, and splitperc_self is the proposed percentage. So the model's fairness term is (fair_percentage - splitperc_self). So the variables involved are token_self, token_opp, and splitperc_self. But splitperc_self is part of the data. So the model uses split_self (monetary term), token_self, token_opp (to compute fair percentage), and splitperc_self (to compare to fair percentage).\n\nWait, but splitperc_self is the proposed percentage. So the model is:\n\nU_accept = beta * split_self (monetary gain) - alpha * max( (fair_percentage - splitperc_self), 0 )\n\nWhere fair_percentage = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100.\n\nSo the variables needed are split_self, token_self, token_opp, and splitperc_self. But splitperc_self is redundant if we can calculate it from split_self and combined_earning. However, since splitperc_self is provided in the dataset, it's acceptable to use it.\n\nBut in the model formula, the fair percentage is calculated from token_self and token_opp, and splitperc_self is compared to that. So the variables used are token_self, token_opp, split_self, and splitperc_self.\n\nBut in the dataset, combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so split_self = (splitperc_self / 100) * combined_earning. However, since split_self is already a variable, we can use it directly for the monetary term.\n\nSo the model uses split_self (monetary term) and the difference between fair percentage and splitperc_self (fairness term). \n\nThus, the variables in the model are:\n\n- split_self (data)\n- token_self (data)\n- token_opp (data)\n- splitperc_self (data)\n\nBut in the model formula, token_self and token_opp are used to compute fair_percentage, which is then compared to splitperc_self. So splitperc_self is necessary.\n\nNow, the variable descriptions:\n\nbeta: learnable, range [0, 10], inclusive.\n\nalpha: learnable, range [0, 10], inclusive.\n\nsplit_self: data variable.\n\ntoken_self: data.\n\ntoken_opp: data.\n\nsplitperc_self: data.\n\nThe calculated variables are fair_percentage and the max term, but they are not parameters, just intermediate calculations.\n\nSo the JSON would list beta and alpha as learnable parameters with their ranges. The other variables are from data.\n\nNow, the summary should explain the model concisely. It combines absolute monetary gain and proportional fairness based on contributions. The utility increases with higher offers but decreases if the offer is below the contribution-based fair percentage. Parameters beta and alpha represent sensitivity to money and fairness, respectively.\n\nTesting parameter recovery: Since beta and alpha are in different units (money vs percentage points), their covariance might be lower. For example, a participant with high beta and low alpha would accept offers even if unfair, prioritizing money. Conversely, high alpha and low beta would reject unfair offers even if the money is decent.\n\nThis model adds a new angle compared to previous models by considering the proportional fairness relative to both participants' contributions, not just the participant's own contribution. Previous models looked at the split_self compared to 3*token_self (their own contribution), but this model considers the split percentage relative to their contribution proportion. This could better capture situations where the total pot varies, as the fairness is relative to the combined contributions.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = beta * split_self - alpha * max( ( (token_self / (token_self + token_opp) ) * 100 - splitperc_self ), 0 )\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to absolute monetary gain from the proposed split\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to proportional fairness deficit relative to contribution-based equity\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed monetary amount for the participant (in \u00a3)\",\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant in the pretask\",\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent in the pretask\",\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"splitperc_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed percentage share for the participant\",\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA dual-component utility model where acceptance utility depends on absolute monetary gain and proportional fairness relative to contributions.

Alpha controls sensitivity to this proportional inequity, capturing aversion to receiving less than one's contribution share.",
  "full_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts the utility of accepting an offer for the responder role, based on the given dataset. The model needs to incorporate psychological principles, avoid high covariance between parameters, and use no more than two learnable parameters. Let's start by understanding the key variables and the task.\n\nFirst, the responder's decision to accept or reject an offer likely depends on factors like the fairness of the offer relative to their contribution and the opponent's contribution. The dataset includes variables like token_self (participant's tokens), token_opp (opponent's tokens), split_self (proposed share), and combined_earning. The trial_type indicates whether contributions are equal, opponent more, or participant more.\n\nPrevious models (Model 1 and 2) considered the absolute monetary gain (split_self) and a fairness component based on the participant's own contribution (3 * token_self). However, they didn't account for the opponent's contribution. A key psychological principle here might be inequity aversion, where people dislike unequal outcomes. But maybe the responder compares their share not just to their own contribution but also to the opponent's. \n\nAnother angle is the ratio of the proposed split to what's considered fair. For example, a fair split might be proportional to each person's contribution. If the participant contributed more tokens, they might expect a higher share. So, the fair share could be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. The utility might then depend on how much the proposed split_self deviates from this fair value.\n\nBut the problem states that two equal split_self values don't represent the same fairness because combined_earning varies. So, the model should account for the proportion of the total each person contributed. Let's think about the fair share as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. The proposed split_self minus this fair share would indicate over or under-offer. \n\nAlternatively, the model could use the difference between the proposed percentage (splitperc_self) and the fair percentage (token_self / (token_self + token_opp) * 100). This would normalize the fairness across different combined_earning values. For example, if the participant contributed 60% of the tokens, a 50% split would be unfair, but if they contributed 50%, 50% is fair.\n\nSo, the utility could be a function of the monetary gain (split_self) and the deviation from the fair percentage. Let's denote the fair percentage as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The deviation is splitperc_self - fair_percentage. If the split is less than fair, this would be negative, reducing utility. If it's more, positive, increasing utility. \n\nBut how to model this? Maybe a linear combination: U = \u03b2 * split_self + \u03b1 * (splitperc_self - fair_percentage). Here, \u03b2 represents the sensitivity to monetary gain, and \u03b1 represents sensitivity to fairness (proportional inequity). If \u03b1 is positive, offers above the fair percentage increase utility, below decrease. But maybe participants are only averse to being under-compensated. So, perhaps a term that only penalizes when splitperc_self is less than fair. So, max(fair_percentage - splitperc_self, 0). Then, U = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_percentage - splitperc_self, 0). This way, if the offer is below fair, there's a penalty scaled by \u03b1. If it's above, no penalty. \n\nBut wait, the splitperc_self is already a percentage. The fair percentage is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. So, the difference between splitperc_self and fair_percentage is the percentage point deviation. For example, if fair is 60% and split is 50%, that's a 10% point deficit. The penalty would be 10 * \u03b1. \n\nThis approach accounts for both the absolute monetary gain (split_self) and the proportional fairness relative to contributions. The parameters \u03b2 and \u03b1 would capture the trade-off between self-interest and fairness concerns. \n\nBut the problem states that the model should not include parameters for general stochasticity (like a temperature parameter), so we focus on deterministic utility. Also, the model must have no more than two learnable parameters, which \u03b2 and \u03b1 are. \n\nNow, considering parameter recovery and covariance. If \u03b2 and \u03b1 are on different scales, they might not covary much. For example, \u03b2 scales with pounds, \u03b1 with percentage points. But if the variables are normalized, covariance could be an issue. However, since the model uses two distinct terms, each parameter might capture different aspects, reducing covariance. \n\nThe variables needed are split_self (data), token_self (data), token_opp (data), and splitperc_self (data). The fair_percentage is calculated as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The term (fair_percentage - splitperc_self) is the deficit. \n\nSo the model would be:\n\nU_accept = \u03b2 * split_self - \u03b1 * max(fair_percentage - splitperc_self, 0)\n\nWhere fair_percentage is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100.\n\nThis model uses two learnable parameters (\u03b2 and \u03b1) with ranges. For \u03b2, since it's scaling the monetary value, a reasonable range could be [0, some upper bound], but since split_self can vary, maybe a larger range. However, to keep it generous, perhaps [-10, 10], allowing for negative or positive weights. But since split_self is a positive value, a negative \u03b2 would imply that higher offers reduce utility, which is unlikely. So \u03b2 should be positive. So range [0, 10]. \n\nFor \u03b1, the fairness sensitivity. The penalty term is in percentage points. If \u03b1 is positive, it penalizes offers below the fair percentage. The range could be [0, 10], as well. \n\nBut the problem says the bounds should be generous. So maybe [0, 20] for both. But let's check. For example, if split_self is \u00a310, \u03b2=1 would contribute 10. If the deficit is 10% points, \u03b1=1 would subtract 10. So the parameters need to be on a scale that allows their product with the variables to influence the utility appropriately. \n\nAlternatively, if split_self is in pounds and the deficit is in percentage points, the parameters \u03b2 and \u03b1 would have different units. So their ranges might need to be different. For example, \u03b2 could be in [0, 1] (since split_self can be up to combined_earning, which is 3*(token_self + token_opp)), but token_self and token_opp vary. However, to avoid restricting, perhaps set \u03b2 to [0, 10] and \u03b1 to [0, 10]. \n\nAnother consideration: the fair percentage could be zero if token_self is zero, but in the dataset, token_self is from a pretask, so it's possible. But the model should handle that. If token_self and token_opp are both zero, but combined_earning is zero, but that's probably not the case. \n\nIn the dataset, combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So split_self is part of that. The splitperc_self is (split_self / combined_earning)*100. So the fair percentage is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. So the deficit is (fair_percentage - splitperc_self). \n\nThis model captures the idea that participants evaluate both the absolute amount they receive and whether that amount is fair relative to their contribution. If the offer is below their fair share, they experience a utility loss proportional to the deficit. The parameters \u03b2 and \u03b1 represent the weight given to monetary gain and fairness, respectively. \n\nThis approach builds on inequity aversion but in a proportional sense rather than absolute. It also uses variables available in the dataset: token_self, token_opp, split_self, splitperc_self. \n\nNow, checking the model against the requirements:\n\n1. Predict responder behavior: Yes, as trial_role is 1 for responder.\n2. Psychological principles: Inequity aversion, proportional fairness.\n3. Low covariance: \u03b2 and \u03b1 are in different units (money vs percentage points), so covariance might be manageable.\n4. Uses dataset variables: Yes, token_self, token_opp, split_self, splitperc_self (but splitperc_self can be calculated from split_self and combined_earning, which is 3*(token_self + token_opp). However, splitperc_self is already a variable in the dataset.\n5. No stochastic parameters: Correct.\n6. Two learnable parameters: \u03b2 and \u03b1.\n\nSo the model seems to fit the requirements. Now, formalizing the model:\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = beta * split_self - alpha * max(( (token_self / (token_self + token_opp) ) * 100 - splitperc_self ), 0)\n</MODEL>\n\nBut wait, the fair percentage is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The deficit is fair_percentage - splitperc_self. So the max of that and 0. So if splitperc_self is less than fair, the deficit is positive, leading to a penalty. If it's equal or more, the penalty is zero.\n\nVariables:\n\n- beta: learnable, scaling the monetary gain.\n- alpha: learnable, scaling the fairness penalty.\n- split_self: from data.\n- token_self: from data.\n- token_opp: from data.\n- splitperc_self: from data.\n\nBut splitperc_self is redundant because it's (split_self / combined_earning)*100, and combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So split_self = (splitperc_self / 100) * 3*(token_self + token_opp). However, since splitperc_self is a variable in the dataset, we can use it directly.\n\nBut in the model, the fair percentage is calculated as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. So the model uses token_self and token_opp to compute the fair percentage, then subtracts splitperc_self. \n\nSo the variables needed are split_self, token_self, token_opp, splitperc_self. All of which are present in the dataset.\n\nNow, variable descriptions:\n\nbeta: learnable, range [0, 10], inclusive.\n\nalpha: learnable, range [0, 10], inclusive.\n\nsplit_self: data variable, source data.\n\ntoken_self: data variable.\n\ntoken_opp: data variable.\n\nsplitperc_self: data variable.\n\nThe max term is calculated, not a learnable parameter.\n\nSo the variables section would list beta and alpha as learnable, with their ranges. The other variables are from data or calculated.\n\nNow, the JSON structure:\n\nFor each variable in the model:\n\n- U_accept: calculated, range -inf to inf.\n- beta: learnable, min 0, max 10, inclusive.\n- alpha: learnable, min 0, max 10, inclusive.\n- split_self: data, source data.\n- token_self: data.\n- token_opp: data.\n- splitperc_self: data.\n\nBut in the model formula, the max function uses (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100 - splitperc_self. So splitperc_self is part of the calculation. However, splitperc_self is a variable in the dataset, so we can use it directly. Wait, no: the fair percentage is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. splitperc_self is the proposed percentage. So the term is (fair_percentage - splitperc_self). So the model uses token_self, token_opp, and splitperc_self from the data.\n\nBut in the dataset, splitperc_self is provided. So the model can directly use that variable. Wait, no: the fair percentage is calculated from token_self and token_opp, and splitperc_self is the proposed percentage. So the model's fairness term is (fair_percentage - splitperc_self). So the variables involved are token_self, token_opp, and splitperc_self. But splitperc_self is part of the data. So the model uses split_self (monetary term), token_self, token_opp (to compute fair percentage), and splitperc_self (to compare to fair percentage).\n\nWait, but splitperc_self is the proposed percentage. So the model is:\n\nU_accept = beta * split_self (monetary gain) - alpha * max( (fair_percentage - splitperc_self), 0 )\n\nWhere fair_percentage = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100.\n\nSo the variables needed are split_self, token_self, token_opp, and splitperc_self. But splitperc_self is redundant if we can calculate it from split_self and combined_earning. However, since splitperc_self is provided in the dataset, it's acceptable to use it.\n\nBut in the model formula, the fair percentage is calculated from token_self and token_opp, and splitperc_self is compared to that. So the variables used are token_self, token_opp, split_self, and splitperc_self.\n\nBut in the dataset, combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so split_self = (splitperc_self / 100) * combined_earning. However, since split_self is already a variable, we can use it directly for the monetary term.\n\nSo the model uses split_self (monetary term) and the difference between fair percentage and splitperc_self (fairness term). \n\nThus, the variables in the model are:\n\n- split_self (data)\n- token_self (data)\n- token_opp (data)\n- splitperc_self (data)\n\nBut in the model formula, token_self and token_opp are used to compute fair_percentage, which is then compared to splitperc_self. So splitperc_self is necessary.\n\nNow, the variable descriptions:\n\nbeta: learnable, range [0, 10], inclusive.\n\nalpha: learnable, range [0, 10], inclusive.\n\nsplit_self: data variable.\n\ntoken_self: data.\n\ntoken_opp: data.\n\nsplitperc_self: data.\n\nThe calculated variables are fair_percentage and the max term, but they are not parameters, just intermediate calculations.\n\nSo the JSON would list beta and alpha as learnable parameters with their ranges. The other variables are from data.\n\nNow, the summary should explain the model concisely. It combines absolute monetary gain and proportional fairness based on contributions. The utility increases with higher offers but decreases if the offer is below the contribution-based fair percentage. Parameters beta and alpha represent sensitivity to money and fairness, respectively.\n\nTesting parameter recovery: Since beta and alpha are in different units (money vs percentage points), their covariance might be lower. For example, a participant with high beta and low alpha would accept offers even if unfair, prioritizing money. Conversely, high alpha and low beta would reject unfair offers even if the money is decent.\n\nThis model adds a new angle compared to previous models by considering the proportional fairness relative to both participants' contributions, not just the participant's own contribution. Previous models looked at the split_self compared to 3*token_self (their own contribution), but this model considers the split percentage relative to their contribution proportion. This could better capture situations where the total pot varies, as the fairness is relative to the combined contributions.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = beta * split_self - alpha * max( ( (token_self / (token_self + token_opp) ) * 100 - splitperc_self ), 0 )\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to absolute monetary gain from the proposed split\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to proportional fairness deficit relative to contribution-based equity\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed monetary amount for the participant (in \u00a3)\",\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant in the pretask\",\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent in the pretask\",\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"splitperc_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed percentage share for the participant\",\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA dual-component utility model where acceptance utility depends on absolute monetary gain and proportional fairness relative to contributions.
