      "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts the utility of accepting an offer for the responder in the given experiment. The model needs to be based on psychological principles, use the dataset variables appropriately, and have no more than two learnable parameters. Also, it should avoid high covariance between parameters and pass parameter recovery tests.\n\nFirst, looking at the previous models, they all incorporate some form of fairness consideration. Model 1 uses the difference between the fair share (3*token_self) and the actual split_self. Model 2 normalizes that difference by the fair share. Model 3 looks at the percentage difference between the contribution-based fair share and the proposed percentage. Model 4 uses the ratio of contributions versus the ratio of splits. So, the existing models have explored different ways to represent fairness: absolute difference, normalized difference, percentage difference, and ratio comparison.\n\nTo come up with a new model that's different yet still psychologically plausible, I need to think of another angle. One possibility is to consider the concept of \"guilt\" or \"disappointment\" when the offer is below a certain threshold. Alternatively, maybe the responder compares their split not just to their own contribution but also to the opponent's contribution. For example, if the responder contributed more tokens, they might expect a higher split, and vice versa.\n\nAnother angle is to consider the total combined earning. Since each trial has a different combined earning, the same split_self might represent different fairness levels depending on the total. For instance, getting \u00a310 out of \u00a320 is different from \u00a310 out of \u00a330. So, perhaps the model should account for the proportion of the total that the split_self represents relative to their contribution.\n\nWait, the problem statement mentions that two equal split_self variables don't represent the same fairness because the combined earning varies. So, the model needs to factor in the combined earning somehow. Let's think: the fair share for the participant would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Because each token is worth \u00a33, combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So, the fair share percentage is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The splitperc_self is the proposed percentage. So, the difference between these two percentages could be a measure of unfairness.\n\nLooking at Model 3, it uses (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)*100 - splitperc_self). So, if the proposed percentage is less than their contribution percentage, that's a negative utility. But Model 3 is already considered. So maybe another way is to use the difference in absolute terms, but squared to capture aversion more strongly as the discrepancy increases. For example, a quadratic term for the difference, which would make larger discrepancies more aversive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the utility is linear in the split_self but also includes a term that compares the split_self to the fair share. The fair share is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Let's compute that: combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so fair share is 3*token_self. Wait, that's the same as in Model 1. Because combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning = 3*token_self. So, the fair share in absolute terms is 3*token_self. So, split_self is compared to 3*token_self. If split_self is less than that, there's a penalty. But Model 1 already uses max(3*token_self - split_self, 0). So maybe that's covered.\n\nBut the problem is that in the dataset, combined_earning is given as a variable. So perhaps the fair share is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Wait, but combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so that's the same as 3*token_self + 3*token_opp. So, the fair share would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning = 3*token_self. So, that's the same as before. So, maybe the fair share is 3*token_self, and split_self is compared to that. But that's what Model 1 does.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fair share is split according to the ratio of tokens. For example, if the participant found 2 tokens and the opponent found 1, the fair split would be 2:1. So, the fair split_self would be (2/3)*combined_earning. But combined_earning is 3*(2+1) = \u00a39. So fair split_self would be \u00a36. So, if the proposed split_self is \u00a35, then the difference is \u00a31. But Model 3 uses the percentage difference. So, in this case, the fair percentage is (2/3)*100 \u2248 66.67%, and if the proposed splitperc_self is 55%, then the difference is 11.67 percentage points. Model 3's penalty is alpha multiplied by that difference.\n\nBut maybe another approach is to consider the ratio of the proposed split to the fair split. For example, if the proposed split_self is 5 and the fair is 6, the ratio is 5/6 \u2248 0.833. Then, the utility could have a term that is sensitive to this ratio. For example, a logarithmic term, as in prospect theory, where deviations from the reference point (fair split) are valued logarithmically. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, the ratio could be used directly. If the ratio is less than 1, there's a penalty proportional to (1 - ratio). But this might be similar to existing models.\n\nAlternatively, the model could consider both the absolute monetary gain (split_self) and the relative gain compared to the opponent's split (split_opp). For example, if the responder cares about how much more the opponent is getting compared to themselves. But in the responder's case, when they are responding to a proposal, split_opp is the opponent's proposed share. So, if the responder is getting split_self and the opponent is getting split_opp, maybe the responder compares these two. Inequity aversion models often consider the difference between self and others. So, if split_self < split_opp, that's a negative utility. But in the dataset, when the responder is the responder (trial_role=1), the split_self is what the proposer (opponent) is offering to the responder, and split_opp is what the proposer keeps. So, the responder might dislike if the proposer is keeping more than they are offering. But how does that relate to their contributions?\n\nWait, the token_self is the participant's contribution, token_opp is the opponent's contribution. So, the total is combined_earning = 3*(token_self + token_opp). The proposer (opponent) offers split_self to the responder and keeps split_opp. So, split_self + split_opp = combined_earning. The responder's contribution is token_self, and the proposer's contribution is token_opp. So, the responder might feel that the proposer's split_opp should be related to their contribution (token_opp). For example, if the proposer contributed more, maybe it's fair for them to keep more. But the responder might not know the proposer's contribution, but in the experiment, perhaps they do. Wait, the task description says that in the pretask, the participant finds their own tokens (token_self) and the opponent's tokens (token_opp) are known. So, the responder knows both token_self and token_opp. So, they can compute the fair split based on contributions.\n\nSo, the fair split_self would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Which is 3*token_self, as before. So, if the proposed split_self is less than 3*token_self, that's unfair. But Models 1 and 2 already use this. Model 3 uses the percentage difference. Model 4 uses the ratio of contributions vs. splits.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the responder's utility depends on both the absolute amount they receive (split_self) and the difference between their split and the proposer's split (split_opp - split_self). Inequity aversion models often include terms for both advantageous and disadvantageous inequity. However, the problem states not to model the utility of rejecting, only accepting. So, when accepting, the responder might feel negative utility if the proposer is keeping more than them, especially if the proposer contributed less. \n\nWait, the proposer's contribution is token_opp. So, if the proposer contributed less (token_opp < token_self) but is keeping more (split_opp > split_self), that's unfair. So, the responder's utility could be a function of split_self (self-interest) and the difference between split_opp and split_self adjusted by the contributions. For example, the inequity term could be (split_opp / token_opp) - (split_self / token_self). If the proposer's split per token is higher than the responder's, that's unfair. So, the term would be max( (split_opp / token_opp) - (split_self / token_self), 0 ). This represents the excess per-token allocation the proposer is giving themselves compared to the responder. If this is positive, it's a penalty. \n\nThis approach compares how much each party is getting per token contributed. If the proposer (who contributed token_opp tokens) is getting split_opp, their per-token is split_opp / token_opp. The responder's per-token is split_self / token_self. If the proposer's per-token is higher, that's inequitable. So, the model could penalize that difference. \n\nThis is different from previous models. Model 4 uses the ratio of contributions vs. splits, but this is a per-token comparison. Let's formalize this:\n\nUtility = beta * split_self - alpha * max( (split_opp / token_opp) - (split_self / token_self), 0 )\n\nHere, beta is the sensitivity to the absolute offer, and alpha is the sensitivity to the inequity in per-token allocation. This model would capture the idea that responders care not just about the absolute amount they receive but also about whether the proposer is keeping more per token than they are offering to the responder. \n\nThis model uses split_self, split_opp, token_self, and token_opp. All these variables are present in the dataset. The parameters are beta and alpha, both learnable. The ranges for beta could be [0, some upper bound], as higher beta means more weight on the absolute gain. Alpha's range could be [0, upper], as it's a penalty term. \n\nThis model hasn't been used in previous models, so it's a new angle. It's based on the idea of per-token fairness, which is a different psychological mechanism than the previous contribution-based or percentage-based models. \n\nAnother consideration is the combined_earning. Since split_self + split_opp = combined_earning, but split_opp can be expressed as combined_earning - split_self. However, using split_opp directly might be more straightforward. \n\nNow, checking the dataset variables: split_opp is a float64, token_opp is int64, token_self is int64. All are available. \n\nThe model would thus have two parameters: beta (weight on self-interest) and alpha (sensitivity to per-token inequity). The utility is higher when split_self is higher, but lower when the proposer's per-token split exceeds the responder's. \n\nThis model meets the requirements: two learnable parameters, uses variables from the dataset, focuses on responder behavior, and builds on psychological principles (inequity aversion based on per-token allocation). It also avoids high covariance if the terms are orthogonal enough. \n\nNow, the mathematical model would be:\n\nU_accept = beta * split_self - alpha * max( (split_opp / token_opp) - (split_self / token_self), 0 )\n\nVariables:\n\n- split_self: from data\n- split_opp: from data\n- token_self: from data\n- token_opp: from data\n- beta: learnable parameter, range [0, maybe 10] (since split_self can be up to combined_earning, which is 3*(token_self + token_opp). For example, if token_self + token_opp is up to, say, 10 each, combined_earning could be 60, so split_self up to 60. So beta's effect would be scaled by split_self. But beta's range can be [0, 10], inclusive.\n\n- alpha: learnable parameter, range [0, 10], inclusive. \n\nThe max function ensures that only cases where the proposer's per-token is higher than the responder's are penalized. If the responder's per-token is higher or equal, there's no penalty. \n\nThis model introduces a new way to capture fairness concerns, different from previous models. It's plausible because people might compare not just the absolute splits but how much each party is getting relative to their contribution. For example, if the proposer contributed 2 tokens and keeps \u00a36 (split_opp=6), that's \u00a33 per token. If the responder contributed 3 tokens and is offered \u00a36 (split_self=6), that's \u00a32 per token. The difference here is \u00a31 per token, which the model would penalize. \n\nThis model's parameters are beta and alpha, both with reasonable bounds. The model should be identifiable if the terms are not perfectly correlated. For example, in trials where split_self is high but the per-token inequity is also high, the parameters can be estimated separately. \n\nIn summary, this model captures self-interest and per-token inequity aversion, using two learnable parameters with clear psychological interpretations.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = beta * split_self - alpha * max( (split_opp / token_opp) - (split_self / token_self), 0 )\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to absolute monetary gain from accepting\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to per-token allocation inequity between proposer and responder\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed monetary amount for the responder\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed monetary amount kept by the proposer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the responder\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the proposer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA dual-component utility model where acceptance utility depends on absolute monetary gain and per-token allocation fairness.

  "full_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts the utility of accepting an offer for the responder in the given experiment. The model needs to be based on psychological principles, use the dataset variables appropriately, and have no more than two learnable parameters. Also, it should avoid high covariance between parameters and pass parameter recovery tests.\n\nFirst, looking at the previous models, they all incorporate some form of fairness consideration. Model 1 uses the difference between the fair share (3*token_self) and the actual split_self. Model 2 normalizes that difference by the fair share. Model 3 looks at the percentage difference between the contribution-based fair share and the proposed percentage. Model 4 uses the ratio of contributions versus the ratio of splits. So, the existing models have explored different ways to represent fairness: absolute difference, normalized difference, percentage difference, and ratio comparison.\n\nTo come up with a new model that's different yet still psychologically plausible, I need to think of another angle. One possibility is to consider the concept of \"guilt\" or \"disappointment\" when the offer is below a certain threshold. Alternatively, maybe the responder compares their split not just to their own contribution but also to the opponent's contribution. For example, if the responder contributed more tokens, they might expect a higher split, and vice versa.\n\nAnother angle is to consider the total combined earning. Since each trial has a different combined earning, the same split_self might represent different fairness levels depending on the total. For instance, getting \u00a310 out of \u00a320 is different from \u00a310 out of \u00a330. So, perhaps the model should account for the proportion of the total that the split_self represents relative to their contribution.\n\nWait, the problem statement mentions that two equal split_self variables don't represent the same fairness because the combined earning varies. So, the model needs to factor in the combined earning somehow. Let's think: the fair share for the participant would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Because each token is worth \u00a33, combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So, the fair share percentage is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The splitperc_self is the proposed percentage. So, the difference between these two percentages could be a measure of unfairness.\n\nLooking at Model 3, it uses (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)*100 - splitperc_self). So, if the proposed percentage is less than their contribution percentage, that's a negative utility. But Model 3 is already considered. So maybe another way is to use the difference in absolute terms, but squared to capture aversion more strongly as the discrepancy increases. For example, a quadratic term for the difference, which would make larger discrepancies more aversive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the utility is linear in the split_self but also includes a term that compares the split_self to the fair share. The fair share is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Let's compute that: combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so fair share is 3*token_self. Wait, that's the same as in Model 1. Because combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning = 3*token_self. So, the fair share in absolute terms is 3*token_self. So, split_self is compared to 3*token_self. If split_self is less than that, there's a penalty. But Model 1 already uses max(3*token_self - split_self, 0). So maybe that's covered.\n\nBut the problem is that in the dataset, combined_earning is given as a variable. So perhaps the fair share is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Wait, but combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so that's the same as 3*token_self + 3*token_opp. So, the fair share would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning = 3*token_self. So, that's the same as before. So, maybe the fair share is 3*token_self, and split_self is compared to that. But that's what Model 1 does.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fair share is split according to the ratio of tokens. For example, if the participant found 2 tokens and the opponent found 1, the fair split would be 2:1. So, the fair split_self would be (2/3)*combined_earning. But combined_earning is 3*(2+1) = \u00a39. So fair split_self would be \u00a36. So, if the proposed split_self is \u00a35, then the difference is \u00a31. But Model 3 uses the percentage difference. So, in this case, the fair percentage is (2/3)*100 \u2248 66.67%, and if the proposed splitperc_self is 55%, then the difference is 11.67 percentage points. Model 3's penalty is alpha multiplied by that difference.\n\nBut maybe another approach is to consider the ratio of the proposed split to the fair split. For example, if the proposed split_self is 5 and the fair is 6, the ratio is 5/6 \u2248 0.833. Then, the utility could have a term that is sensitive to this ratio. For example, a logarithmic term, as in prospect theory, where deviations from the reference point (fair split) are valued logarithmically. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, the ratio could be used directly. If the ratio is less than 1, there's a penalty proportional to (1 - ratio). But this might be similar to existing models.\n\nAlternatively, the model could consider both the absolute monetary gain (split_self) and the relative gain compared to the opponent's split (split_opp). For example, if the responder cares about how much more the opponent is getting compared to themselves. But in the responder's case, when they are responding to a proposal, split_opp is the opponent's proposed share. So, if the responder is getting split_self and the opponent is getting split_opp, maybe the responder compares these two. Inequity aversion models often consider the difference between self and others. So, if split_self < split_opp, that's a negative utility. But in the dataset, when the responder is the responder (trial_role=1), the split_self is what the proposer (opponent) is offering to the responder, and split_opp is what the proposer keeps. So, the responder might dislike if the proposer is keeping more than they are offering. But how does that relate to their contributions?\n\nWait, the token_self is the participant's contribution, token_opp is the opponent's contribution. So, the total is combined_earning = 3*(token_self + token_opp). The proposer (opponent) offers split_self to the responder and keeps split_opp. So, split_self + split_opp = combined_earning. The responder's contribution is token_self, and the proposer's contribution is token_opp. So, the responder might feel that the proposer's split_opp should be related to their contribution (token_opp). For example, if the proposer contributed more, maybe it's fair for them to keep more. But the responder might not know the proposer's contribution, but in the experiment, perhaps they do. Wait, the task description says that in the pretask, the participant finds their own tokens (token_self) and the opponent's tokens (token_opp) are known. So, the responder knows both token_self and token_opp. So, they can compute the fair split based on contributions.\n\nSo, the fair split_self would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Which is 3*token_self, as before. So, if the proposed split_self is less than 3*token_self, that's unfair. But Models 1 and 2 already use this. Model 3 uses the percentage difference. Model 4 uses the ratio of contributions vs. splits.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the responder's utility depends on both the absolute amount they receive (split_self) and the difference between their split and the proposer's split (split_opp - split_self). Inequity aversion models often include terms for both advantageous and disadvantageous inequity. However, the problem states not to model the utility of rejecting, only accepting. So, when accepting, the responder might feel negative utility if the proposer is keeping more than them, especially if the proposer contributed less. \n\nWait, the proposer's contribution is token_opp. So, if the proposer contributed less (token_opp < token_self) but is keeping more (split_opp > split_self), that's unfair. So, the responder's utility could be a function of split_self (self-interest) and the difference between split_opp and split_self adjusted by the contributions. For example, the inequity term could be (split_opp / token_opp) - (split_self / token_self). If the proposer's split per token is higher than the responder's, that's unfair. So, the term would be max( (split_opp / token_opp) - (split_self / token_self), 0 ). This represents the excess per-token allocation the proposer is giving themselves compared to the responder. If this is positive, it's a penalty. \n\nThis approach compares how much each party is getting per token contributed. If the proposer (who contributed token_opp tokens) is getting split_opp, their per-token is split_opp / token_opp. The responder's per-token is split_self / token_self. If the proposer's per-token is higher, that's inequitable. So, the model could penalize that difference. \n\nThis is different from previous models. Model 4 uses the ratio of contributions vs. splits, but this is a per-token comparison. Let's formalize this:\n\nUtility = beta * split_self - alpha * max( (split_opp / token_opp) - (split_self / token_self), 0 )\n\nHere, beta is the sensitivity to the absolute offer, and alpha is the sensitivity to the inequity in per-token allocation. This model would capture the idea that responders care not just about the absolute amount they receive but also about whether the proposer is keeping more per token than they are offering to the responder. \n\nThis model uses split_self, split_opp, token_self, and token_opp. All these variables are present in the dataset. The parameters are beta and alpha, both learnable. The ranges for beta could be [0, some upper bound], as higher beta means more weight on the absolute gain. Alpha's range could be [0, upper], as it's a penalty term. \n\nThis model hasn't been used in previous models, so it's a new angle. It's based on the idea of per-token fairness, which is a different psychological mechanism than the previous contribution-based or percentage-based models. \n\nAnother consideration is the combined_earning. Since split_self + split_opp = combined_earning, but split_opp can be expressed as combined_earning - split_self. However, using split_opp directly might be more straightforward. \n\nNow, checking the dataset variables: split_opp is a float64, token_opp is int64, token_self is int64. All are available. \n\nThe model would thus have two parameters: beta (weight on self-interest) and alpha (sensitivity to per-token inequity). The utility is higher when split_self is higher, but lower when the proposer's per-token split exceeds the responder's. \n\nThis model meets the requirements: two learnable parameters, uses variables from the dataset, focuses on responder behavior, and builds on psychological principles (inequity aversion based on per-token allocation). It also avoids high covariance if the terms are orthogonal enough. \n\nNow, the mathematical model would be:\n\nU_accept = beta * split_self - alpha * max( (split_opp / token_opp) - (split_self / token_self), 0 )\n\nVariables:\n\n- split_self: from data\n- split_opp: from data\n- token_self: from data\n- token_opp: from data\n- beta: learnable parameter, range [0, maybe 10] (since split_self can be up to combined_earning, which is 3*(token_self + token_opp). For example, if token_self + token_opp is up to, say, 10 each, combined_earning could be 60, so split_self up to 60. So beta's effect would be scaled by split_self. But beta's range can be [0, 10], inclusive.\n\n- alpha: learnable parameter, range [0, 10], inclusive. \n\nThe max function ensures that only cases where the proposer's per-token is higher than the responder's are penalized. If the responder's per-token is higher or equal, there's no penalty. \n\nThis model introduces a new way to capture fairness concerns, different from previous models. It's plausible because people might compare not just the absolute splits but how much each party is getting relative to their contribution. For example, if the proposer contributed 2 tokens and keeps \u00a36 (split_opp=6), that's \u00a33 per token. If the responder contributed 3 tokens and is offered \u00a36 (split_self=6), that's \u00a32 per token. The difference here is \u00a31 per token, which the model would penalize. \n\nThis model's parameters are beta and alpha, both with reasonable bounds. The model should be identifiable if the terms are not perfectly correlated. For example, in trials where split_self is high but the per-token inequity is also high, the parameters can be estimated separately. \n\nIn summary, this model captures self-interest and per-token inequity aversion, using two learnable parameters with clear psychological interpretations.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = beta * split_self - alpha * max( (split_opp / token_opp) - (split_self / token_self), 0 )\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to absolute monetary gain from accepting\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to per-token allocation inequity between proposer and responder\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed monetary amount for the responder\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed monetary amount kept by the proposer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the responder\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the proposer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA dual-component utility model where acceptance utility depends on absolute monetary gain and per-token allocation fairness.
