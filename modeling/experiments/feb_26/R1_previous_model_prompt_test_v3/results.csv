1,,"U_accept = beta * split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)","A two-parameter model capturing responder utility as a trade-off between monetary gain and fairness. The utility combines the proposed split value (scaled by beta) with a penalty (alpha) for offers below the participant's contribution-based fair share (3 * token_self). Alpha quantifies aversion to disadvantageous inequity, while beta represents the marginal utility of money. The model explicitly links fairness expectations to pretask contributions, avoiding covariance issues through distinct parameter roles.",v3,0.8516541265639913,0.8995305521395054
