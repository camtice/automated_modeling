The utility of accepting an offer depends on the proposed amount, penalized by two parameters: alpha (disutility when underpaid relative to one's contribution) and beta (disutility when overpaid). This accounts for both self-interest and fairness considerations anchored to the participant's own contribution level.",v2,0.9443308015348333,0.5649186804427708
