1,,"U_accept = split_self + beta - alpha * max((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning - split_self, 0)","The model computes the utility of accepting a monetary offer by combining the received monetary amount (split_self) with a baseline bias (beta) and subtracting a fairness penalty weighted by sensitivity parameter (alpha) when the offer falls below an expected fair share. The expected fair share is derived from the ratio of the participantâ€™s tokens to the total tokens, multiplied by the combined earnings.",v4
