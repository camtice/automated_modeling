Utility U_accept = split_self - alpha * |split_self - F_rho|","The model computes the utility of participants’ accepted offers as responders by comparing the offered share (split_self) to a fairness benchmark, where the fair share is derived from the participant’s token count relative to a weighted sum of both contributions (using the parameter rho) and scaled by the total earnings. A fairness sensitivity parameter (alpha) penalizes the absolute deviation from this fair share, yielding a utility that can be used to infer the likelihood of acceptance.",v5,0.7418687185819122,0.5617508841510009
