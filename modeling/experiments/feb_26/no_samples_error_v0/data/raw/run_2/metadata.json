      "output": "Let me think through this step by step...\n\nThe key psychological mechanisms involved in responder behavior in this ultimatum game are fairness and self-interest.  Responders are likely to consider the fairness of the offer (how much they receive relative to the opponent and their contributions), but also their own self-interest (how much money they will receive).  A completely fair split would be proportional to each player's contribution (tokens).  However, responders might accept unfair offers if the absolute amount offered is sufficiently high.\n\nThese mechanisms interact in a complex way. A highly unfair offer (small `split_self` relative to `token_self` and `token_opp`) might still be accepted if `split_self` is a large absolute amount. Conversely, a slightly unfair offer might be rejected if `split_self` is a small absolute amount.  A simple additive model might not capture this interaction well, as it could lead to scenarios where an extremely large `split_self` overrides a completely unfair split proportion.\n\nA multiplicative model might better represent this interaction.  Fairness could be represented by the ratio of the proposed split to the proportional share based on tokens.  Then, this fairness component could be multiplied by a self-interest component, which is simply the absolute amount of money to be received. This avoids the issue of small unfair offers being accepted if the absolute monetary amount is large.\n\nThe model will need two parameters:\n\n1.  `fairness_sensitivity`: This parameter scales the importance of the fairness aspect of the offer. A higher value means responders are more sensitive to unfairness, and requires a higher absolute monetary amount to compensate for a smaller proportional split. This value should be positive.\n\n2.  `absolute_amount_weight`: This parameter represents the weight of absolute monetary amount in the utility function.  A higher value implies that responders are more focused on the absolute amount received, regardless of fairness. This value should be positive.\n\nThe model variables map to observable behavior as follows:  A higher utility will result in a higher probability of accepting the offer (represented by `accept`).  The utility is influenced by both the fairness of the offer (relative to token contributions) and the absolute amount of money offered (`split_self`).\n\n<MODEL>\nU = fairness_sensitivity * (split_self / (combined_earning * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)))) * absolute_amount_weight * split_self\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"fairness_sensitivity\": {\n      \"description\": \"Parameter representing the sensitivity to fairness of the offer.

Fairness is calculated as the ratio of the participant's received proportion to their expected proportion based on token contributions. The model has two learnable parameters: fairness_sensitivity and absolute_amount_weight.  The utility of accepting an offer is the product of the fairness-scaled proportion of money received and the absolute amount of money.",
  "full_reasoning": "Let me think through this step by step...\n\nThe key psychological mechanisms involved in responder behavior in this ultimatum game are fairness and self-interest.  Responders are likely to consider the fairness of the offer (how much they receive relative to the opponent and their contributions), but also their own self-interest (how much money they will receive).  A completely fair split would be proportional to each player's contribution (tokens).  However, responders might accept unfair offers if the absolute amount offered is sufficiently high.\n\nThese mechanisms interact in a complex way. A highly unfair offer (small `split_self` relative to `token_self` and `token_opp`) might still be accepted if `split_self` is a large absolute amount. Conversely, a slightly unfair offer might be rejected if `split_self` is a small absolute amount.  A simple additive model might not capture this interaction well, as it could lead to scenarios where an extremely large `split_self` overrides a completely unfair split proportion.\n\nA multiplicative model might better represent this interaction.  Fairness could be represented by the ratio of the proposed split to the proportional share based on tokens.  Then, this fairness component could be multiplied by a self-interest component, which is simply the absolute amount of money to be received. This avoids the issue of small unfair offers being accepted if the absolute monetary amount is large.\n\nThe model will need two parameters:\n\n1.  `fairness_sensitivity`: This parameter scales the importance of the fairness aspect of the offer. A higher value means responders are more sensitive to unfairness, and requires a higher absolute monetary amount to compensate for a smaller proportional split. This value should be positive.\n\n2.  `absolute_amount_weight`: This parameter represents the weight of absolute monetary amount in the utility function.  A higher value implies that responders are more focused on the absolute amount received, regardless of fairness. This value should be positive.\n\nThe model variables map to observable behavior as follows:  A higher utility will result in a higher probability of accepting the offer (represented by `accept`).  The utility is influenced by both the fairness of the offer (relative to token contributions) and the absolute amount of money offered (`split_self`).\n\n<MODEL>\nU = fairness_sensitivity * (split_self / (combined_earning * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)))) * absolute_amount_weight * split_self\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"fairness_sensitivity\": {\n      \"description\": \"Parameter representing the sensitivity to fairness of the offer.
