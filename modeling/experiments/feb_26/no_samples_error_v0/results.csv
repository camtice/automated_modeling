Fairness is calculated as the ratio of the participant's received proportion to their expected proportion based on token contributions. The model has two learnable parameters: fairness_sensitivity and absolute_amount_weight.  The utility of accepting an offer is the product of the fairness-scaled proportion of money received and the absolute amount of money.",v0,,,0.4824682450190869,0.5370788828312525
