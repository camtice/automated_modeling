      "output": "Let me think through this step by step...\n\nThe key psychological mechanisms involved in responder behavior in this ultimatum game are fairness and self-interest.  Responders are likely to consider both how fair the offer is relative to their contribution and the absolute monetary value of the offer.  However, Model 1 already captures a direct linear combination of fairness and self-interest.  A potential limitation is the assumption of a simple linear relationship.  It might be more realistic to assume a non-linear interaction, particularly with regards to fairness.  Extreme unfairness might lead to a disproportionately strong rejection tendency, regardless of the monetary value. This is why it is useful to focus on just one aspect at a time. Therefore I'll focus on fairness this time.\n\nTo capture a non-linear relationship between perceived fairness and utility, we can consider a model where utility increases with fairness up to a point, and then plateaus or even decreases if the offer becomes overly generous (perhaps suggesting manipulation).  This can be modeled using a sigmoidal function.  A second parameter captures the sensitivity to this perceived fairness. \n\n\nA simple model with one learnable parameter focuses solely on fairness perception and its non-linear effect on utility.\n\n\nWhat mathematical form could capture this?  A sigmoidal function, such as a logistic function, would be appropriate.\n\nWhat parameters would be needed?  A parameter representing the sensitivity to fairness (steepness of the sigmoid) and a parameter describing the midpoint of fairness where the utility is most beneficial. However we will only use one parameter now.\n\nHow do model variables map to observable behavior?  Higher sensitivity to fairness will lead to sharper increases in utility for fair offers and stronger negative utility for unfair offers.  The sigmoid's midpoint determines the 'ideal' fairness point.\n\nLet's build a model with one learnable parameter to capture fairness sensitivity, focusing on the nonlinearity of fairness perception. This allows us to explore another parameter space that the previous model did not account for. The parameter will be the steepness of a sigmoid, and it is crucial to include the non-linear nature of this relationship as it accounts for a great portion of possible deviations from the first model.\n\n\n<MODEL>\nU =  1/(1 + exp(-fairness_sensitivity * (splitperc_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100)))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"fairness_sensitivity\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to fairness (steepness of sigmoid)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"splitperc_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Percentage of the combined earnings proposed to the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1000\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1000\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n<SUMMARY>\nA single-parameter model of responder utility based on a logistic function of perceived fairness.

Higher values indicate greater sensitivity to perceived fairness discrepancies.",
  "full_reasoning": "Let me think through this step by step...\n\nThe key psychological mechanisms involved in responder behavior in this ultimatum game are fairness and self-interest.  Responders are likely to consider both how fair the offer is relative to their contribution and the absolute monetary value of the offer.  However, Model 1 already captures a direct linear combination of fairness and self-interest.  A potential limitation is the assumption of a simple linear relationship.  It might be more realistic to assume a non-linear interaction, particularly with regards to fairness.  Extreme unfairness might lead to a disproportionately strong rejection tendency, regardless of the monetary value. This is why it is useful to focus on just one aspect at a time. Therefore I'll focus on fairness this time.\n\nTo capture a non-linear relationship between perceived fairness and utility, we can consider a model where utility increases with fairness up to a point, and then plateaus or even decreases if the offer becomes overly generous (perhaps suggesting manipulation).  This can be modeled using a sigmoidal function.  A second parameter captures the sensitivity to this perceived fairness. \n\n\nA simple model with one learnable parameter focuses solely on fairness perception and its non-linear effect on utility.\n\n\nWhat mathematical form could capture this?  A sigmoidal function, such as a logistic function, would be appropriate.\n\nWhat parameters would be needed?  A parameter representing the sensitivity to fairness (steepness of the sigmoid) and a parameter describing the midpoint of fairness where the utility is most beneficial. However we will only use one parameter now.\n\nHow do model variables map to observable behavior?  Higher sensitivity to fairness will lead to sharper increases in utility for fair offers and stronger negative utility for unfair offers.  The sigmoid's midpoint determines the 'ideal' fairness point.\n\nLet's build a model with one learnable parameter to capture fairness sensitivity, focusing on the nonlinearity of fairness perception. This allows us to explore another parameter space that the previous model did not account for. The parameter will be the steepness of a sigmoid, and it is crucial to include the non-linear nature of this relationship as it accounts for a great portion of possible deviations from the first model.\n\n\n<MODEL>\nU =  1/(1 + exp(-fairness_sensitivity * (splitperc_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100)))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"fairness_sensitivity\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to fairness (steepness of sigmoid)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"splitperc_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Percentage of the combined earnings proposed to the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1000\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1000\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n<SUMMARY>\nA single-parameter model of responder utility based on a logistic function of perceived fairness.
