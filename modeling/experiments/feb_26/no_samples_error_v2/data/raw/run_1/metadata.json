      "output": "Let me think through this step by step...\n\n**Key Psychological Mechanisms:**\n\nThe key psychological mechanisms at play in this responder task are fairness and self-interest. Responders will likely consider the fairness of the proposed split relative to their contribution and the opponent's contribution, and balance this against their self-interest (i.e., maximizing their own monetary gain).\n\n**How These Mechanisms Interact:**\n\nA responder's decision to accept or reject an offer is likely driven by a combination of fairness considerations and self-interest.  A perfectly fair split would be proportional to each player's contribution to the combined earnings. However, responders may accept offers that are slightly unfair if the monetary gain is substantial enough. Conversely, a very unfair offer, even if it provides a large monetary reward, might be rejected due to strong feelings of inequity aversion.\n\n**Mathematical Form:**\n\nWe can capture these interactions with a utility function that combines both fairness and self-interest.  A simple model would weigh the deviation from a perceived fair split against the absolute monetary gain.  Since we want to restrict the model to two learnable parameters, we will combine both aspects into a single term reflecting the acceptability of the proposed split.\n\n\n**Parameters:**\n\nWe need two learnable parameters:\n\n1.  `fairness_weight`:  Represents the responder's sensitivity to fairness violations.  A higher value indicates a stronger preference for fair splits, even at the cost of potential monetary gain.\n2.  `gain_weight`: Represents the responder's sensitivity to monetary gains. A higher value indicates a stronger preference to maximize monetary reward, potentially at the cost of fairness.\n\n\n**Model Variables Mapping to Observable Behavior:**\n\nThe model variables map to observable behavior as follows:\n\n*   `token_self` and `token_opp` determine the perceived fair split.\n*   `split_self` represents the monetary gain offered to the responder.\n*   `fairness_weight` and `gain_weight` modulate the importance of fairness and self-interest in the utility calculation.\n*   The utility function determines the predicted acceptance of an offer (higher utility = higher probability of acceptance).\n\n<MODEL>\nU =  gain_weight * split_self - fairness_weight * abs((split_self / combined_earning) - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"gain_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to monetary gain in utility calculation\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"fairness_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to fairness in utility calculation\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the participant (in \u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money earned\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\":{\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model for responder behavior based on a weighted combination of monetary gain and fairness.

Fairness is calculated as the deviation of the proposed split from a split proportional to the participants' contributions. The model has two learnable parameters: `gain_weight` and `fairness_weight`, representing the relative importance of monetary gain and fairness, respectively.",
  "full_reasoning": "Let me think through this step by step...\n\n**Key Psychological Mechanisms:**\n\nThe key psychological mechanisms at play in this responder task are fairness and self-interest. Responders will likely consider the fairness of the proposed split relative to their contribution and the opponent's contribution, and balance this against their self-interest (i.e., maximizing their own monetary gain).\n\n**How These Mechanisms Interact:**\n\nA responder's decision to accept or reject an offer is likely driven by a combination of fairness considerations and self-interest.  A perfectly fair split would be proportional to each player's contribution to the combined earnings. However, responders may accept offers that are slightly unfair if the monetary gain is substantial enough. Conversely, a very unfair offer, even if it provides a large monetary reward, might be rejected due to strong feelings of inequity aversion.\n\n**Mathematical Form:**\n\nWe can capture these interactions with a utility function that combines both fairness and self-interest.  A simple model would weigh the deviation from a perceived fair split against the absolute monetary gain.  Since we want to restrict the model to two learnable parameters, we will combine both aspects into a single term reflecting the acceptability of the proposed split.\n\n\n**Parameters:**\n\nWe need two learnable parameters:\n\n1.  `fairness_weight`:  Represents the responder's sensitivity to fairness violations.  A higher value indicates a stronger preference for fair splits, even at the cost of potential monetary gain.\n2.  `gain_weight`: Represents the responder's sensitivity to monetary gains. A higher value indicates a stronger preference to maximize monetary reward, potentially at the cost of fairness.\n\n\n**Model Variables Mapping to Observable Behavior:**\n\nThe model variables map to observable behavior as follows:\n\n*   `token_self` and `token_opp` determine the perceived fair split.\n*   `split_self` represents the monetary gain offered to the responder.\n*   `fairness_weight` and `gain_weight` modulate the importance of fairness and self-interest in the utility calculation.\n*   The utility function determines the predicted acceptance of an offer (higher utility = higher probability of acceptance).\n\n<MODEL>\nU =  gain_weight * split_self - fairness_weight * abs((split_self / combined_earning) - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"gain_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to monetary gain in utility calculation\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"fairness_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to fairness in utility calculation\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the participant (in \u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money earned\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\":{\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model for responder behavior based on a weighted combination of monetary gain and fairness.
