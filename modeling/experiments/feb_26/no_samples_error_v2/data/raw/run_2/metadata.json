      "output": "Let me think through this step by step...\n\nThe key psychological mechanisms involved in responder behavior in this ultimatum game are likely to be:\n\n1. **Self-interest:** Responders will prioritize maximizing their own monetary gain.  This is captured by the `split_self` variable.\n\n2. **Fairness:** Responders will consider the fairness of the offer.  Simple fairness models often consider the proportional share relative to contributions.  However,  a more nuanced model might consider the absolute difference in the proposed split.  Considering the total combined earning is critical to account for the fact that a 50/50 split is not necessarily fair across all trials, as the combined earning varies.  Therefore, the difference between the proportion of the self's contribution and the proportion of the offered money is likely a better measure of fairness.\n\n\n3. **Relative Contributions:** The responders' perception of fairness is heavily influenced by the ratio of their token contributions (`token_self`) to the total contributions (`token_self + token_opp`).\n\n\nHow these mechanisms interact:  A responder's utility is likely a function of both their monetary gain and their perception of fairness.  A highly unfair offer, even if lucrative, might be rejected.  Conversely, a slightly unfair but generous offer might be accepted.\n\nWhat mathematical form could capture these interactions: A linear combination of gain and a fairness term would be a suitable starting point.  The fairness term needs to capture the deviation from proportional fairness.\n\nWhat parameters would be needed to calibrate the model: Two parameters are sufficient: one to weigh the importance of monetary gain and another to weigh the importance of fairness.\n\nHow the model variables map to observable behavior:  The `split_self` variable directly represents monetary gain. The fairness term, incorporating `token_self`, `token_opp`, `split_self`, and `combined_earning`, captures the perceived fairness of the offer.  The weights will determine the responsiveness to gain and fairness.  Higher gain weight leads to more acceptance; higher fairness weight leads to more rejection of unfair offers.\n\n\n<MODEL>\nU = gain_weight * split_self - fairness_weight * abs((split_self / combined_earning) - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"gain_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to monetary gain in the utility function.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"fairness_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to perceived fairness in the utility function.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The proposed share for the participant (in \u00a3).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Amount of money earned in total.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model for responder behavior based on a weighted combination of monetary gain and fairness.

Fairness is calculated as the absolute deviation of the proposed split from a split proportional to the participants' contributions. The model has two learnable parameters: `gain_weight` and `fairness_weight`, representing the relative importance of monetary gain and fairness, respectively.",
  "full_reasoning": "Let me think through this step by step...\n\nThe key psychological mechanisms involved in responder behavior in this ultimatum game are likely to be:\n\n1. **Self-interest:** Responders will prioritize maximizing their own monetary gain.  This is captured by the `split_self` variable.\n\n2. **Fairness:** Responders will consider the fairness of the offer.  Simple fairness models often consider the proportional share relative to contributions.  However,  a more nuanced model might consider the absolute difference in the proposed split.  Considering the total combined earning is critical to account for the fact that a 50/50 split is not necessarily fair across all trials, as the combined earning varies.  Therefore, the difference between the proportion of the self's contribution and the proportion of the offered money is likely a better measure of fairness.\n\n\n3. **Relative Contributions:** The responders' perception of fairness is heavily influenced by the ratio of their token contributions (`token_self`) to the total contributions (`token_self + token_opp`).\n\n\nHow these mechanisms interact:  A responder's utility is likely a function of both their monetary gain and their perception of fairness.  A highly unfair offer, even if lucrative, might be rejected.  Conversely, a slightly unfair but generous offer might be accepted.\n\nWhat mathematical form could capture these interactions: A linear combination of gain and a fairness term would be a suitable starting point.  The fairness term needs to capture the deviation from proportional fairness.\n\nWhat parameters would be needed to calibrate the model: Two parameters are sufficient: one to weigh the importance of monetary gain and another to weigh the importance of fairness.\n\nHow the model variables map to observable behavior:  The `split_self` variable directly represents monetary gain. The fairness term, incorporating `token_self`, `token_opp`, `split_self`, and `combined_earning`, captures the perceived fairness of the offer.  The weights will determine the responsiveness to gain and fairness.  Higher gain weight leads to more acceptance; higher fairness weight leads to more rejection of unfair offers.\n\n\n<MODEL>\nU = gain_weight * split_self - fairness_weight * abs((split_self / combined_earning) - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"gain_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to monetary gain in the utility function.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"fairness_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to perceived fairness in the utility function.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The proposed share for the participant (in \u00a3).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Amount of money earned in total.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model for responder behavior based on a weighted combination of monetary gain and fairness.
