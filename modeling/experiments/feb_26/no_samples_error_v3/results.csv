A loss aversion parameter modulates the impact of offers below the estimated fair value. The utility is scaled by sensitivity to deviation.",v3

This difference is then multiplied by a sensitivity parameter (alpha), and finally a loss aversion term punishes offers perceived as unfair, if the (split_self - beta * split_opp) is negative.",v3

The sensitivity to this difference is determined by a sensitivity parameter (alpha), and the weight of the fairness threshold is determined by a weighting parameter (beta).",v3
