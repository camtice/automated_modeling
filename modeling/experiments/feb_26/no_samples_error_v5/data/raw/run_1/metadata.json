      "output": "To create a computational model for responder behavior in the context of the task provided, we need to identify the psychological mechanisms at play and how they correlate with the variables described.\n\n### Key Psychological Mechanisms:\n1. **Fairness Considerations**: The responder's utility is influenced by how fair they perceive the offer to be. When the opponent proposes rewards, responders will assess these based on both their own and the opponent's token contributions.\n  \n2. **Equity and Social Comparison**: Responders tend to compare their own contributions (token_self) against that of their opponent (token_opp). This social comparison can create feelings of resentment or acceptance based on the perceived fairness of the split.\n  \n3. **Past Experiences and Expectations**: The responder's future acceptance behavior can be influenced by past experiences with the fairness of offers seen in previous trials.\n\n### Interaction of Mechanisms:\nThe combined earnings and how they are split between self and opponent will guide the responder's perceived utility of accepting the offer. The responder's utility can be modeled as a function of both the proposed shares and the contributions.\n\n### Mathematical Form:\nThe utility can be expressed as:\n- \\( U = \u03b1 \\cdot \\text{split_self} + \u03b2 \\cdot \\text{split_opp} - \u03b4 \\cdot (token_opp - token_self) \\)\n\nWhere:\n- \\( U \\) is the utility for accepting the offer.\n- \\( \u03b1 \\) captures the desirability of one's own share.\n- \\( \u03b2 \\) captures the perceived impact or benefit of the opponent's share.\n- \\( \u03b4 \\) captures the comparative disadvantage based on token contributions.\n\nHere, we are limiting the learnable parameters to those that represent important psychological influences, while avoiding excessive complexity.\n\n### Parameters:\n1. **\u03b1 (alpha)**: The utility weight on the self\u2019s proposed share split. This parameter influences the acceptance of the proposed share for oneself. \n   - **Bounds**: [0, 1]\n  \n2. **\u03b2 (beta)**: The utility weight on the opponent\u2019s proposed share split. This reflects how much the responder values the share proposed for the opponent, which can influence their decision based on fairness.\n   - **Bounds**: [0, 1]\n\n### Model Variables Mapping to Observable Behavior:\n- `split_self`: Provides the monetary incentive for the responder based on their role.\n- `split_opp`: Represents what the responder views as the opponent's contribution.\n- `token_self` and `token_opp`: These determine the context of fairness; differences in contributions may impact utility negatively.\n  \n### Model Specification:\nThe following expression captures all the interactions while conforming to the provided dataset structure:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * split_self + beta * split_opp - delta * (token_opp - token_self)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility weight on self's proposed share\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility weight on opponent's proposed share\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"delta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Adjustment factor reflecting the impact of opponent's tokens vs. self tokens\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the opponent in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA linear utility model capturing the responder's acceptance behavior based on the proposed shares for both self and opponent, modulated by their token contributions.

  "full_reasoning": "To create a computational model for responder behavior in the context of the task provided, we need to identify the psychological mechanisms at play and how they correlate with the variables described.\n\n### Key Psychological Mechanisms:\n1. **Fairness Considerations**: The responder's utility is influenced by how fair they perceive the offer to be. When the opponent proposes rewards, responders will assess these based on both their own and the opponent's token contributions.\n  \n2. **Equity and Social Comparison**: Responders tend to compare their own contributions (token_self) against that of their opponent (token_opp). This social comparison can create feelings of resentment or acceptance based on the perceived fairness of the split.\n  \n3. **Past Experiences and Expectations**: The responder's future acceptance behavior can be influenced by past experiences with the fairness of offers seen in previous trials.\n\n### Interaction of Mechanisms:\nThe combined earnings and how they are split between self and opponent will guide the responder's perceived utility of accepting the offer. The responder's utility can be modeled as a function of both the proposed shares and the contributions.\n\n### Mathematical Form:\nThe utility can be expressed as:\n- \\( U = \u03b1 \\cdot \\text{split_self} + \u03b2 \\cdot \\text{split_opp} - \u03b4 \\cdot (token_opp - token_self) \\)\n\nWhere:\n- \\( U \\) is the utility for accepting the offer.\n- \\( \u03b1 \\) captures the desirability of one's own share.\n- \\( \u03b2 \\) captures the perceived impact or benefit of the opponent's share.\n- \\( \u03b4 \\) captures the comparative disadvantage based on token contributions.\n\nHere, we are limiting the learnable parameters to those that represent important psychological influences, while avoiding excessive complexity.\n\n### Parameters:\n1. **\u03b1 (alpha)**: The utility weight on the self\u2019s proposed share split. This parameter influences the acceptance of the proposed share for oneself. \n   - **Bounds**: [0, 1]\n  \n2. **\u03b2 (beta)**: The utility weight on the opponent\u2019s proposed share split. This reflects how much the responder values the share proposed for the opponent, which can influence their decision based on fairness.\n   - **Bounds**: [0, 1]\n\n### Model Variables Mapping to Observable Behavior:\n- `split_self`: Provides the monetary incentive for the responder based on their role.\n- `split_opp`: Represents what the responder views as the opponent's contribution.\n- `token_self` and `token_opp`: These determine the context of fairness; differences in contributions may impact utility negatively.\n  \n### Model Specification:\nThe following expression captures all the interactions while conforming to the provided dataset structure:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * split_self + beta * split_opp - delta * (token_opp - token_self)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility weight on self's proposed share\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility weight on opponent's proposed share\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"delta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Adjustment factor reflecting the impact of opponent's tokens vs. self tokens\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the opponent in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA linear utility model capturing the responder's acceptance behavior based on the proposed shares for both self and opponent, modulated by their token contributions.
