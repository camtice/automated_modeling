      "output": "Let's analyze the task step by step to construct a cognitive model of responder behavior based on the provided dataset:\n\n1. **Key Psychological Mechanisms Involved**:\n   - **Equity and Fairness**: Responders often weigh the fairness of the offer presented relative to their own contributions and those of their opponents.\n   - **Self vs. Opponent Contribution**: The responder may consider their tokens (token_self) alongside the opponent's tokens (token_opp) when evaluating the equity of the proposed split.\n   - **Subjective Value of Offers**: The dollar amounts proposed (split_self and split_opp) are converted into perceived fairness which impacts acceptance.\n\n2. **Mechanisms Interaction**:\n   - The perceptions stemming from the contributions (token_self, token_opp) could be influenced by the proposed values (split_self, split_opp). A higher contribution may lead to higher acceptance of offers even if the split is not strictly equal.\n   - The balance between self-interest and fairness considerations could be represented as a trade-off in the utility function.\n\n3. **Mathematical Form**:\n   - A linear model can compactly capture the interaction between fairness and self-interest. The utility for accepting an offer can be formulated as:\n   \\( U = \u03b1 \\cdot split_self + \u03b2 \\cdot (split_opp - fairness_adjustment) \\)\n   - Here, fairness_adjustment can be modeled as the discrepancy between self and opponent contributions.\n\n4. **Parameters needed**:\n   - **Learnable Parameters**:\n     - \\( \u03b1 \\) (scale for the acceptance value corresponding to the self-offer) must reflect the importance given to one's own proposed share.\n     - \\( \u03b2 \\) (scale for the opponent's offer) must indicate how much the responder values the opponent's proposed share relative to reducing perceived inequity.\n   -  Both parameters should be bounded to reflect that utility cannot be influenced beyond a certain limit in terms of fairness perception:\n     - \\(0 < \u03b1 \u2264 1\\)\n     - \\(0 < \u03b2 \u2264 1\\)\n\n5. **Model Variables Mapping to Behavior**:\n   - The values \\( split_self \\) and \\( split_opp \\) directly relate to the proposed monetary values.\n   - The contributions (token_self and token_opp) influence how equitable the responder perceives the situation, directly inputting into their utility decision-making.\n\nPutting this all together, we can define our model:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (split_opp - (0.5 * (token_opp - token_self)))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposed offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight for the self-proposed split's influence on the utility\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight for the opponent's proposed split's influence on the utility, adjusted for fairness\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the participant in pounds (\u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the opponent in pounds (\u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model predicting responder behavior based on proposed offers, incorporating self-interest and perceived fairness relative to both participants' contributions.

The utility is based on proposed shares adjusted for contribution discrepancies, allowing for nuanced acceptance behaviors in opportunistic contexts.",
  "full_reasoning": "Let's analyze the task step by step to construct a cognitive model of responder behavior based on the provided dataset:\n\n1. **Key Psychological Mechanisms Involved**:\n   - **Equity and Fairness**: Responders often weigh the fairness of the offer presented relative to their own contributions and those of their opponents.\n   - **Self vs. Opponent Contribution**: The responder may consider their tokens (token_self) alongside the opponent's tokens (token_opp) when evaluating the equity of the proposed split.\n   - **Subjective Value of Offers**: The dollar amounts proposed (split_self and split_opp) are converted into perceived fairness which impacts acceptance.\n\n2. **Mechanisms Interaction**:\n   - The perceptions stemming from the contributions (token_self, token_opp) could be influenced by the proposed values (split_self, split_opp). A higher contribution may lead to higher acceptance of offers even if the split is not strictly equal.\n   - The balance between self-interest and fairness considerations could be represented as a trade-off in the utility function.\n\n3. **Mathematical Form**:\n   - A linear model can compactly capture the interaction between fairness and self-interest. The utility for accepting an offer can be formulated as:\n   \\( U = \u03b1 \\cdot split_self + \u03b2 \\cdot (split_opp - fairness_adjustment) \\)\n   - Here, fairness_adjustment can be modeled as the discrepancy between self and opponent contributions.\n\n4. **Parameters needed**:\n   - **Learnable Parameters**:\n     - \\( \u03b1 \\) (scale for the acceptance value corresponding to the self-offer) must reflect the importance given to one's own proposed share.\n     - \\( \u03b2 \\) (scale for the opponent's offer) must indicate how much the responder values the opponent's proposed share relative to reducing perceived inequity.\n   -  Both parameters should be bounded to reflect that utility cannot be influenced beyond a certain limit in terms of fairness perception:\n     - \\(0 < \u03b1 \u2264 1\\)\n     - \\(0 < \u03b2 \u2264 1\\)\n\n5. **Model Variables Mapping to Behavior**:\n   - The values \\( split_self \\) and \\( split_opp \\) directly relate to the proposed monetary values.\n   - The contributions (token_self and token_opp) influence how equitable the responder perceives the situation, directly inputting into their utility decision-making.\n\nPutting this all together, we can define our model:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (split_opp - (0.5 * (token_opp - token_self)))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposed offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight for the self-proposed split's influence on the utility\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight for the opponent's proposed split's influence on the utility, adjusted for fairness\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the participant in pounds (\u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the opponent in pounds (\u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model predicting responder behavior based on proposed offers, incorporating self-interest and perceived fairness relative to both participants' contributions.
