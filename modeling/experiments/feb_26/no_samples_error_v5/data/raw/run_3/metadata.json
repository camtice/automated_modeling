      "output": "To create an effective model of responder behavior in this experiment, we need to consider various psychological principles related to fairness, self-interest, and perceived contributions. In particular, we should focus on how participants gauge offers both in terms of their own contributions (self) and those of their opponents (other). \n\n### Key Psychological Mechanisms\n\n1. **Fairness Consideration**: Responder behavior often hinges on fairness. If the proposed shares (split_self and split_opp) deviate significantly from what participants believe is a fair division considering their contributions (token_self and token_opp), utility may decrease.\n  \n2. **Self-Interest**: A responder's acceptance is influenced by their potential gain. Higher utility is expected when the personal share (split_self) is closer to what they perceive as a fair outcome given their contribution.\n\n3. **Relativity of Offers**: The way proposals are perceived can depend heavily on the context, particularly on how it compares to their own contributions. The model must account for the contrast effect where responders evaluate offers relative to their own tokens.\n\n### Interaction of Mechanisms\n\nThe interaction between fairness consideration and self-interest will impact the utility calculation quite significantly. As responders assess the utility of accepting an offer, they will weigh their personal gain against the perceived fairness of the split. \n\n### Mathematical Formulation\n\nGiven the above considerations, we can express a utility function for responders that incorporates both their share of the split and the fairness of that offer relative to their tokens.\n\nLet's define our utility function as follows: \n\n\\[\nU = \\alpha (split\\_self - threshold) + \\beta (split\\_opp - self\\_perception)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\alpha \\) is a parameter reflecting the weight given to the participant's proposed share (split_self).\n- \\( \\beta \\) reflects the response sensitivity to the opponent's proposed share (split_opp), adjusted by the responder\u2019s perception of fairness based on their contributions.\n\n### Parameter Specifications\n\n1. **alpha**: This parameter assesses how much weight the responder gives to their proposed share. \n   - **Range**: [0, 1], inclusive.\n  \n2. **beta**: This parameter assesses how much weight the responder gives to the opponent\u2019s proposed share, relative to what they perceive as fair based on their contributions in tokens.\n   - **Range**: [0, 1], inclusive.\n\n3. The threshold can be defined, for example, as half of the total contribution to represent a baseline for fairness.\n4. The self_perception could be defined simply as a fixed proportion of their own tokens to further adjust the perceptions of fairness.\n\n### Variable Mapping\n\nIn this formula:\n- \\( split\\_self \\) and \\( split\\_opp \\) are directly tied to the proposed shares.\n- The adjustments based on self-perception and thresholding simulate the fairness evaluation process.\n\n<MODEL>\nU = \u03b1 * (split_self - 0.5 * combined_earning) + \u03b2 * (split_opp - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposed action\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to the responder's proposed share\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to the opponent's proposed share adjusted by self-perception\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"combined_earning\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"combined_earning\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money earned combined for both participants\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model predicting responder acceptance behavior based on the proposed shares from both participant and opponent, factoring in fairness and self-perception adjustments.

  "full_reasoning": "To create an effective model of responder behavior in this experiment, we need to consider various psychological principles related to fairness, self-interest, and perceived contributions. In particular, we should focus on how participants gauge offers both in terms of their own contributions (self) and those of their opponents (other). \n\n### Key Psychological Mechanisms\n\n1. **Fairness Consideration**: Responder behavior often hinges on fairness. If the proposed shares (split_self and split_opp) deviate significantly from what participants believe is a fair division considering their contributions (token_self and token_opp), utility may decrease.\n  \n2. **Self-Interest**: A responder's acceptance is influenced by their potential gain. Higher utility is expected when the personal share (split_self) is closer to what they perceive as a fair outcome given their contribution.\n\n3. **Relativity of Offers**: The way proposals are perceived can depend heavily on the context, particularly on how it compares to their own contributions. The model must account for the contrast effect where responders evaluate offers relative to their own tokens.\n\n### Interaction of Mechanisms\n\nThe interaction between fairness consideration and self-interest will impact the utility calculation quite significantly. As responders assess the utility of accepting an offer, they will weigh their personal gain against the perceived fairness of the split. \n\n### Mathematical Formulation\n\nGiven the above considerations, we can express a utility function for responders that incorporates both their share of the split and the fairness of that offer relative to their tokens.\n\nLet's define our utility function as follows: \n\n\\[\nU = \\alpha (split\\_self - threshold) + \\beta (split\\_opp - self\\_perception)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\alpha \\) is a parameter reflecting the weight given to the participant's proposed share (split_self).\n- \\( \\beta \\) reflects the response sensitivity to the opponent's proposed share (split_opp), adjusted by the responder\u2019s perception of fairness based on their contributions.\n\n### Parameter Specifications\n\n1. **alpha**: This parameter assesses how much weight the responder gives to their proposed share. \n   - **Range**: [0, 1], inclusive.\n  \n2. **beta**: This parameter assesses how much weight the responder gives to the opponent\u2019s proposed share, relative to what they perceive as fair based on their contributions in tokens.\n   - **Range**: [0, 1], inclusive.\n\n3. The threshold can be defined, for example, as half of the total contribution to represent a baseline for fairness.\n4. The self_perception could be defined simply as a fixed proportion of their own tokens to further adjust the perceptions of fairness.\n\n### Variable Mapping\n\nIn this formula:\n- \\( split\\_self \\) and \\( split\\_opp \\) are directly tied to the proposed shares.\n- The adjustments based on self-perception and thresholding simulate the fairness evaluation process.\n\n<MODEL>\nU = \u03b1 * (split_self - 0.5 * combined_earning) + \u03b2 * (split_opp - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposed action\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to the responder's proposed share\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to the opponent's proposed share adjusted by self-perception\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"combined_earning\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"combined_earning\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money earned combined for both participants\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model predicting responder acceptance behavior based on the proposed shares from both participant and opponent, factoring in fairness and self-perception adjustments.
