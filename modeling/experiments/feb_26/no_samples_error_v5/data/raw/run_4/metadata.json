      "output": "Let\u2019s reason through the development of a new computational model step by step.\n\n### Key Psychological Mechanisms\n1. **Social Comparison**: Individuals assess their outcomes relative to others. This might motivate responders to accept offers that are at least as favorable as what they perceive to be fair, based on their contribution or tokens.\n2. **Reciprocity**: The act of responding positively to favorable offers made by others. A responder might feel inclined to accept an offer if they perceive fairness in the distribution.\n3. **Negotiation Context**: Responders evaluate the fairness of the proposed split in light of their and their opponent\u2019s contributions. The context of the negotiation might weigh heavily on the acceptance decision.\n\n### Interaction of Mechanisms\nThese mechanisms may interact such that the responder\u2019s utility reflects a balance between perceived fairness derived from social comparison and an intrinsic inclination towards reciprocity. \n\n### Mathematical Formulation\nTo capture these interactions, a utility function could be devised. The utility could be a function of the proposed offers adjusted by a factor incorporating the difference in contributions.\n\n### Proposed Parameters\n1. **Alpha (\u03b1)**: A parameter representing the tendency to accept offers based on the self-share (useful for capturing social comparison and fairness).\n   - **Bounds**: [0, 1]\n2. **Beta (\u03b2)**: A parameter representing the impact of the opponent's proposed share on the acceptance decision (reflecting reciprocity).\n   - **Bounds**: [0, 1]\n\n### Mapping Variables to Observable Behavior\n- **Accept (accept)**: The binary outcome of whether the offer is accepted or not can be directly linked to the utility model.\n- **Split Proposals (split_self, split_opp)**: The proposed shares act as inputs for utility calculation directly corresponding to fairness perceptions.\n- **Tokens (token_self, token_opp)**: These values influence the contextual perceptions of fairness but won't be directly present in the utility model itself because we're capturing fairness with the split values.\n\nNow, let's formalize the mathematical model and variable definitions.\n\n<MODEL>\nU = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * split_opp\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting an offer given the proposed shares.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weighting parameter for the proposed self-share reflecting social comparison aspects.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weighting parameter for the proposed opponent share incorporating reciprocity effects.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the participant in the negotiation.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"combined_earning\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the opponent in the negotiation.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"combined_earning\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model predicting responder acceptance behavior based on self-proposed and opponent's proposed shares.

  "full_reasoning": "Let\u2019s reason through the development of a new computational model step by step.\n\n### Key Psychological Mechanisms\n1. **Social Comparison**: Individuals assess their outcomes relative to others. This might motivate responders to accept offers that are at least as favorable as what they perceive to be fair, based on their contribution or tokens.\n2. **Reciprocity**: The act of responding positively to favorable offers made by others. A responder might feel inclined to accept an offer if they perceive fairness in the distribution.\n3. **Negotiation Context**: Responders evaluate the fairness of the proposed split in light of their and their opponent\u2019s contributions. The context of the negotiation might weigh heavily on the acceptance decision.\n\n### Interaction of Mechanisms\nThese mechanisms may interact such that the responder\u2019s utility reflects a balance between perceived fairness derived from social comparison and an intrinsic inclination towards reciprocity. \n\n### Mathematical Formulation\nTo capture these interactions, a utility function could be devised. The utility could be a function of the proposed offers adjusted by a factor incorporating the difference in contributions.\n\n### Proposed Parameters\n1. **Alpha (\u03b1)**: A parameter representing the tendency to accept offers based on the self-share (useful for capturing social comparison and fairness).\n   - **Bounds**: [0, 1]\n2. **Beta (\u03b2)**: A parameter representing the impact of the opponent's proposed share on the acceptance decision (reflecting reciprocity).\n   - **Bounds**: [0, 1]\n\n### Mapping Variables to Observable Behavior\n- **Accept (accept)**: The binary outcome of whether the offer is accepted or not can be directly linked to the utility model.\n- **Split Proposals (split_self, split_opp)**: The proposed shares act as inputs for utility calculation directly corresponding to fairness perceptions.\n- **Tokens (token_self, token_opp)**: These values influence the contextual perceptions of fairness but won't be directly present in the utility model itself because we're capturing fairness with the split values.\n\nNow, let's formalize the mathematical model and variable definitions.\n\n<MODEL>\nU = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * split_opp\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting an offer given the proposed shares.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weighting parameter for the proposed self-share reflecting social comparison aspects.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weighting parameter for the proposed opponent share incorporating reciprocity effects.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the participant in the negotiation.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"combined_earning\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the opponent in the negotiation.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"combined_earning\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model predicting responder acceptance behavior based on self-proposed and opponent's proposed shares.
