      "output": "Let\u2019s think through the task of creating a new computational model for predicting responder behavior in this experimental setup step by step.\n\n### Key Psychological Mechanisms Involved:\n1. **Fairness Perception**: Responders tend to evaluate the offers based on their contribution (token_self) relative to the opponent's offer (split_opp) and what they consider fair (this could be a 50/50 split based on tokens).\n  \n2. **Social Comparison**: Responders may consider the opponent\u2019s tokens (token_opp) and how it relates to their own tokens (token_self), leading to an assessment of fairness based on comparisons.\n\n3. **Reciprocal Altruism**: If the responder feels they are contributing equally or more (in terms of tokens), they may accept higher split_self offers to reciprocate perceived fairness.\n\n### Interactions Between Mechanisms:\n- Fairness perception influences acceptance of offers. The stronger the perception of fairness (or lack thereof), the more likely a responder is to accept or reject an offer.\n- Social comparison mediates how responders interpret the fairness of offers. If they perceive an offer as favoring the opponent too heavily, their probability to accept declines.\n- Reciprocal motives may modify the utility derived from the offer when token contributions are high, indicating a willingness to accept offers above a certain threshold.\n\n### Mathematical Formulation:\nTo capture these interactions, we can model the utility of accepting an offer using an additive form that integrates the proposed shares (split_self and split_opp) adjusted by a fairness factor determined by the contributions (token_self and token_opp). This leads us to a model like:\n\n\\[\nU = \\alpha \\cdot (split_self - T) + \\beta \\cdot (split_opp - (token_opp / combined_earning))\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(U\\) is the utility.\n- \\(split_self\\): the amount the responder would gain.\n- \\(split_opp\\): the amount proposed by the opponent.\n- \\(T\\) is a fairness threshold based on the responder's contributions.\n- The term \\(\\frac{token_opp}{combined_earning}\\) adjusts the opponent's proposal by their share in relation to the total, capturing a sense of social fairness.\n\n### Parameters Needed for Calibration:\n- **\u03b1**: Weighting parameter for the self-offer's contribution to utility (ranges from 0 to 1).\n- **\u03b2**: Weighting parameter for the opponent's offer, indicating its effect on perceived fairness (ranges from 0 to 1).\n\n### Variable Mapping to Observable Behavior:\n- **split_self**: Directly affects utility; more favorable offers lead to higher utility.\n- **split_opp**: Also affects utility; if perceived unfair, it may lower acceptance likelihood.\n- **token_self** and **token_opp** help shape the fairness threshold \\(T\\).\n\n### Final Model Specification:\nWe formalize the utility model and provide a clear description of each variable involved.\n\n<MODEL>\nU = \u03b1 * (split_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp))) + \u03b2 * (split_opp - (token_opp / combined_earning))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weighting parameter for the participant's proposed split\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weighting parameter for the opponent's proposed split\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"combined_earning\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the opponent in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"combined_earning\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"combined_earning / 3\", \n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"combined_earning / 3\", \n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money earned (\u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model predicting responder acceptance behavior based on self and opponent offers, adjusted by perceived fairness from their contributions.

  "full_reasoning": "Let\u2019s think through the task of creating a new computational model for predicting responder behavior in this experimental setup step by step.\n\n### Key Psychological Mechanisms Involved:\n1. **Fairness Perception**: Responders tend to evaluate the offers based on their contribution (token_self) relative to the opponent's offer (split_opp) and what they consider fair (this could be a 50/50 split based on tokens).\n  \n2. **Social Comparison**: Responders may consider the opponent\u2019s tokens (token_opp) and how it relates to their own tokens (token_self), leading to an assessment of fairness based on comparisons.\n\n3. **Reciprocal Altruism**: If the responder feels they are contributing equally or more (in terms of tokens), they may accept higher split_self offers to reciprocate perceived fairness.\n\n### Interactions Between Mechanisms:\n- Fairness perception influences acceptance of offers. The stronger the perception of fairness (or lack thereof), the more likely a responder is to accept or reject an offer.\n- Social comparison mediates how responders interpret the fairness of offers. If they perceive an offer as favoring the opponent too heavily, their probability to accept declines.\n- Reciprocal motives may modify the utility derived from the offer when token contributions are high, indicating a willingness to accept offers above a certain threshold.\n\n### Mathematical Formulation:\nTo capture these interactions, we can model the utility of accepting an offer using an additive form that integrates the proposed shares (split_self and split_opp) adjusted by a fairness factor determined by the contributions (token_self and token_opp). This leads us to a model like:\n\n\\[\nU = \\alpha \\cdot (split_self - T) + \\beta \\cdot (split_opp - (token_opp / combined_earning))\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(U\\) is the utility.\n- \\(split_self\\): the amount the responder would gain.\n- \\(split_opp\\): the amount proposed by the opponent.\n- \\(T\\) is a fairness threshold based on the responder's contributions.\n- The term \\(\\frac{token_opp}{combined_earning}\\) adjusts the opponent's proposal by their share in relation to the total, capturing a sense of social fairness.\n\n### Parameters Needed for Calibration:\n- **\u03b1**: Weighting parameter for the self-offer's contribution to utility (ranges from 0 to 1).\n- **\u03b2**: Weighting parameter for the opponent's offer, indicating its effect on perceived fairness (ranges from 0 to 1).\n\n### Variable Mapping to Observable Behavior:\n- **split_self**: Directly affects utility; more favorable offers lead to higher utility.\n- **split_opp**: Also affects utility; if perceived unfair, it may lower acceptance likelihood.\n- **token_self** and **token_opp** help shape the fairness threshold \\(T\\).\n\n### Final Model Specification:\nWe formalize the utility model and provide a clear description of each variable involved.\n\n<MODEL>\nU = \u03b1 * (split_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp))) + \u03b2 * (split_opp - (token_opp / combined_earning))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weighting parameter for the participant's proposed split\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weighting parameter for the opponent's proposed split\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"combined_earning\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the opponent in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"combined_earning\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"combined_earning / 3\", \n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"combined_earning / 3\", \n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money earned (\u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model predicting responder acceptance behavior based on self and opponent offers, adjusted by perceived fairness from their contributions.
