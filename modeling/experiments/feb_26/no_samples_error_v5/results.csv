Two learnable parameters, α and β, are used to weight the contributions, which helps account for individual differences in acceptance behavior influenced by both self-interest and fairness considerations.",v5,0.2556460976983309,0.7882265482368026

This model uses two learnable parameters: α for the weight of the self-offer and β for the opponent's offer, both constrained between [0, 1].

The model uses two learnable parameters (α and β) to calibrate the weights of self and opponent's proposed shares, along with a fixed adjustment factor (δ) to account for the disparity between tokens.
