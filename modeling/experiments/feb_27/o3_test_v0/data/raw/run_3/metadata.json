      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Key Psychological Mechanisms:\n\u2003\u2022 Responder behavior is driven not only by the absolute monetary amount received (split_self) but also by its fairness relative to a benchmark.\n\u2003\u2022 The fairness benchmark is derived from the participant\u2019s token contribution relative to the total tokens (token_self and token_opp) and the total available amount (combined_earning).\n\u2003\u2022 Deviations from the fairness benchmark\u2014either being in excess or in deficit\u2014can modify the utility: an offer above the fairness benchmark might be experienced as a \u201cbonus\u201d or may be distrusted, whereas offers below the benchmark might incur a penalty.\n\u2003\u2022 Thus, the psychological process involves comparing the actual offer to a fairness expectation and adjusting utility accordingly.\n\n2. Mechanisms Interaction:\n\u2003\u2022 We first compute a fairness share: fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\n\u2003\u2022 Next, we establish a discrepancy: D = split_self \u2212 fair_share.\n\u2003\u2022 The utility is then composed of a direct value of the offer (split_self), augmented linearly by the discrepancy (which reflects sensitivity to fairness differences) and penalized quadratically to capture the diminishing or adverse effects of large deviations.\n\u2003\u2022 This quadratic term is applied regardless of the sign of the discrepancy, so that both offers that are \u201ctoo generous\u201d (which might be seen as exploitable or insincere) and those that are \u201ctoo stingy\u201d (which are obviously unfair) reduce utility.\n\n3. Mathematical Form:\n\u2003\u2022 The model is defined as:\n\u2003\u2003U = split_self + delta \u00b7 (split_self \u2212 fair_share) \u2212 mu \u00b7 (split_self \u2212 fair_share)\u00b2,\n\u2003where U is the utility associated with accepting the offer, delta is a parameter capturing the linear sensitivity to the fairness deviation, and mu is a parameter capturing the quadratic penalty for large deviations.\n\n4. Parameters Needed:\n\u2003\u2022 delta (learnable, with generous bounds, e.g., between \u221210 and 10): captures the linear weight applied to the fairness discrepancy.\n\u2003\u2022 mu (learnable, with generous bounds, e.g., between 0 and 10): captures the strength of quadratic penalty for deviation from the fairness expectation.\n\u2003\u2022 All other variables (split_self, token_self, token_opp, combined_earning) are observed from the dataset.\n\n5. Mapping to Observable Behavior:\n\u2003\u2022 The observed monetary offer (split_self) and the computed fair_share (based on token_self, token_opp, and combined_earning) interact in the model to produce the discrepancy (split_self \u2212 fair_share).\n\u2003\u2022 This discrepancy, modulated by delta and mu, captures how much the offer deviates from what is perceived as fair.\n\u2003\u2022 A higher utility (U) predicts a higher probability of acceptance, while a negative utility indicates that the offer is far from fairness and is thus unlikely to be accepted.\n\nThe final model specification is given below.\n\n<MODEL>\nU = split_self + delta * (split_self - (token_self/(token_self+token_opp))*combined_earning) - mu * (split_self - (token_self/(token_self+token_opp))*combined_earning)^2\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting a given offer for the responder.

  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Key Psychological Mechanisms:\n\u2003\u2022 Responder behavior is driven not only by the absolute monetary amount received (split_self) but also by its fairness relative to a benchmark.\n\u2003\u2022 The fairness benchmark is derived from the participant\u2019s token contribution relative to the total tokens (token_self and token_opp) and the total available amount (combined_earning).\n\u2003\u2022 Deviations from the fairness benchmark\u2014either being in excess or in deficit\u2014can modify the utility: an offer above the fairness benchmark might be experienced as a \u201cbonus\u201d or may be distrusted, whereas offers below the benchmark might incur a penalty.\n\u2003\u2022 Thus, the psychological process involves comparing the actual offer to a fairness expectation and adjusting utility accordingly.\n\n2. Mechanisms Interaction:\n\u2003\u2022 We first compute a fairness share: fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\n\u2003\u2022 Next, we establish a discrepancy: D = split_self \u2212 fair_share.\n\u2003\u2022 The utility is then composed of a direct value of the offer (split_self), augmented linearly by the discrepancy (which reflects sensitivity to fairness differences) and penalized quadratically to capture the diminishing or adverse effects of large deviations.\n\u2003\u2022 This quadratic term is applied regardless of the sign of the discrepancy, so that both offers that are \u201ctoo generous\u201d (which might be seen as exploitable or insincere) and those that are \u201ctoo stingy\u201d (which are obviously unfair) reduce utility.\n\n3. Mathematical Form:\n\u2003\u2022 The model is defined as:\n\u2003\u2003U = split_self + delta \u00b7 (split_self \u2212 fair_share) \u2212 mu \u00b7 (split_self \u2212 fair_share)\u00b2,\n\u2003where U is the utility associated with accepting the offer, delta is a parameter capturing the linear sensitivity to the fairness deviation, and mu is a parameter capturing the quadratic penalty for large deviations.\n\n4. Parameters Needed:\n\u2003\u2022 delta (learnable, with generous bounds, e.g., between \u221210 and 10): captures the linear weight applied to the fairness discrepancy.\n\u2003\u2022 mu (learnable, with generous bounds, e.g., between 0 and 10): captures the strength of quadratic penalty for deviation from the fairness expectation.\n\u2003\u2022 All other variables (split_self, token_self, token_opp, combined_earning) are observed from the dataset.\n\n5. Mapping to Observable Behavior:\n\u2003\u2022 The observed monetary offer (split_self) and the computed fair_share (based on token_self, token_opp, and combined_earning) interact in the model to produce the discrepancy (split_self \u2212 fair_share).\n\u2003\u2022 This discrepancy, modulated by delta and mu, captures how much the offer deviates from what is perceived as fair.\n\u2003\u2022 A higher utility (U) predicts a higher probability of acceptance, while a negative utility indicates that the offer is far from fairness and is thus unlikely to be accepted.\n\nThe final model specification is given below.\n\n<MODEL>\nU = split_self + delta * (split_self - (token_self/(token_self+token_opp))*combined_earning) - mu * (split_self - (token_self/(token_self+token_opp))*combined_earning)^2\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting a given offer for the responder.
