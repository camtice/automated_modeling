1,,"U_accept = delta * split_self - gamma * max(0, (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning - split_self)","A dual-parameter utility model for responders that integrates self-interest with fairness considerations. The model computes a fairness benchmark from relative token contributions and penalizes offers below this fair share. The utility of accepting is a weighted combination of the monetary offer and a fairness loss, with learnable parameters delta (reward sensitivity) and gamma (inequity aversion).",v1,0.8224378413985136,0.8960957873607102
