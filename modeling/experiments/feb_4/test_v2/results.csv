1,,"Let F = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning
U_accept = bias + fairness_weight * (split_self - F)",A two-parameter utility model for responder behavior that computes a fair share reference based on relative contributions and combined earnings. The utility of accepting is given as an intercept (bias) plus a fairness sensitivity (fairness_weight) multiplied by the difference between the offered share and the calculated fair share.,v2,0.8732235346142531,0.8929030788078586
