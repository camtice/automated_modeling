      "output": "Let me think through this step by step...\n\n**Key Psychological Mechanisms:**\n\nThe key psychological mechanisms involved in this responder task are fairness and self-interest.  Responders likely consider the fairness of the proposed split relative to their contribution (tokens) and the opponent's contribution.  However, they will also prioritize maximizing their own monetary gain. The degree to which fairness concerns outweigh self-interest is likely to vary between individuals.\n\n**How these mechanisms interact:**\n\nFairness and self-interest likely interact in a non-linear way. A perfectly fair offer (50/50 split of combined earnings) would be seen as highly desirable, overriding any minor self-interest considerations. However, as offers become increasingly unfair, the self-interest of maximizing monetary gain becomes increasingly influential.  This is especially true if the proposer\u2019s contribution was considerably smaller.\n\n**What mathematical form could capture these interactions:**\n\nA model that incorporates both fairness and self-interest could take the form of a utility function that combines a fairness term and a self-interest term.  The fairness term would be inversely related to the perceived unfairness of the offer. The self-interest term would simply be the amount of money the responder would receive.\n\n**What parameters would be needed to calibrate the model:**\n\nWe need two learnable parameters:\n\n1.  **Fairness Weight (fairness_weight):** This parameter reflects the relative importance of fairness to the individual.  A higher value indicates a stronger preference for fairness, while a lower value indicates a stronger focus on self-interest.\n\n2.  **Unfairness Sensitivity (unfairness_sensitivity):** This parameter governs how rapidly utility decreases as the perceived unfairness increases.  A higher value indicates greater sensitivity to even minor levels of unfairness.\n\n**How the model variables map to observable behavior:**\n\nThe model maps to observable behavior as follows:  A higher utility value predicts a higher probability of accepting the offer. The utility is calculated by combining a fairness component, which is negative and depends on the difference between a fair split and the proposed split, and a self-interest component, which is simply the monetary amount offered. The balance between these components is determined by the learnable parameters.\n\n\n<MODEL>\nU = self_interest + fairness_weight * ( -unfairness_sensitivity * abs(fair_split - split_self) )\n\nfair_split = combined_earning * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp))\n\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"self_interest\": {\n      \"description\": \"Monetary value of the offer to the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"fairness_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to fairness considerations\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"unfairness_sensitivity\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to perceived unfairness of the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"fair_split\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fair split of the combined earning based on token contributions\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Amount of money proposed for the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\":{\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money earned\",\n      \"range\":{\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\":{\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\":{\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\":{\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\":{\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model for responder behavior based on self-interest and fairness.

  "full_reasoning": "Let me think through this step by step...\n\n**Key Psychological Mechanisms:**\n\nThe key psychological mechanisms involved in this responder task are fairness and self-interest.  Responders likely consider the fairness of the proposed split relative to their contribution (tokens) and the opponent's contribution.  However, they will also prioritize maximizing their own monetary gain. The degree to which fairness concerns outweigh self-interest is likely to vary between individuals.\n\n**How these mechanisms interact:**\n\nFairness and self-interest likely interact in a non-linear way. A perfectly fair offer (50/50 split of combined earnings) would be seen as highly desirable, overriding any minor self-interest considerations. However, as offers become increasingly unfair, the self-interest of maximizing monetary gain becomes increasingly influential.  This is especially true if the proposer\u2019s contribution was considerably smaller.\n\n**What mathematical form could capture these interactions:**\n\nA model that incorporates both fairness and self-interest could take the form of a utility function that combines a fairness term and a self-interest term.  The fairness term would be inversely related to the perceived unfairness of the offer. The self-interest term would simply be the amount of money the responder would receive.\n\n**What parameters would be needed to calibrate the model:**\n\nWe need two learnable parameters:\n\n1.  **Fairness Weight (fairness_weight):** This parameter reflects the relative importance of fairness to the individual.  A higher value indicates a stronger preference for fairness, while a lower value indicates a stronger focus on self-interest.\n\n2.  **Unfairness Sensitivity (unfairness_sensitivity):** This parameter governs how rapidly utility decreases as the perceived unfairness increases.  A higher value indicates greater sensitivity to even minor levels of unfairness.\n\n**How the model variables map to observable behavior:**\n\nThe model maps to observable behavior as follows:  A higher utility value predicts a higher probability of accepting the offer. The utility is calculated by combining a fairness component, which is negative and depends on the difference between a fair split and the proposed split, and a self-interest component, which is simply the monetary amount offered. The balance between these components is determined by the learnable parameters.\n\n\n<MODEL>\nU = self_interest + fairness_weight * ( -unfairness_sensitivity * abs(fair_split - split_self) )\n\nfair_split = combined_earning * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp))\n\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"self_interest\": {\n      \"description\": \"Monetary value of the offer to the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"fairness_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to fairness considerations\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"unfairness_sensitivity\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to perceived unfairness of the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"fair_split\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fair split of the combined earning based on token contributions\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Amount of money proposed for the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\":{\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money earned\",\n      \"range\":{\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\":{\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\":{\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\":{\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\":{\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model for responder behavior based on self-interest and fairness.
