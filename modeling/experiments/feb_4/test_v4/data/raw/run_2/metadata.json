      "output": "Let's design a computational model to predict responder acceptance behavior, focusing on two key psychological mechanisms: self-interest and sensitivity to inequity.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Key Psychological Mechanisms:**  Responders are driven by their self-interest (how much money they receive) and their aversion to inequitable outcomes.  Inequity aversion suggests that unfair offers, where the split deviates from a perceived fair proportion, will reduce the utility of acceptance.\n\n2. **Interaction of Mechanisms:**  The model needs to capture the interplay between self-interest and inequity aversion.  A highly self-interested responder might accept even highly inequitable offers if the monetary gain is large enough. Conversely, a responder with a strong aversion to inequity might reject offers that are perceived as unfair, even if they offer a substantial amount of money.\n\n3. **Mathematical Form:** A suitable mathematical form would combine a term representing self-interest (the proposed amount) and a term representing inequity aversion (a function of the difference between the proposed split and a fair split).\n\n4. **Parameters:** We need parameters to control the relative importance of self-interest and inequity aversion.  A single parameter may not suffice for this, since the model needs the ability to represent a diverse range of human behavior.  Therefore we will use two learnable parameters.\n\n5. **Mapping to Observable Behavior:** The model will predict the utility of accepting an offer based on the proposed amount for the responder (`split_self`) and the perceived unfairness of the offer.  Higher utility values will correspond to a higher probability of acceptance.\n\n\n<MODEL>\nU =  alpha * split_self - beta * abs(split_self - fair_split)\n\nfair_split = combined_earning * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposal.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to self-interest (how much the responder values money).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to inequity aversion (how much the responder dislikes unfairness).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Amount of money proposed to the participant (\u00a3).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"fair_split\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proportionally fair split based on token contributions (\u00a3).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money earned in the trial (\u00a3).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model for responder behavior combining self-interest and inequity aversion.

  "full_reasoning": "Let's design a computational model to predict responder acceptance behavior, focusing on two key psychological mechanisms: self-interest and sensitivity to inequity.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Key Psychological Mechanisms:**  Responders are driven by their self-interest (how much money they receive) and their aversion to inequitable outcomes.  Inequity aversion suggests that unfair offers, where the split deviates from a perceived fair proportion, will reduce the utility of acceptance.\n\n2. **Interaction of Mechanisms:**  The model needs to capture the interplay between self-interest and inequity aversion.  A highly self-interested responder might accept even highly inequitable offers if the monetary gain is large enough. Conversely, a responder with a strong aversion to inequity might reject offers that are perceived as unfair, even if they offer a substantial amount of money.\n\n3. **Mathematical Form:** A suitable mathematical form would combine a term representing self-interest (the proposed amount) and a term representing inequity aversion (a function of the difference between the proposed split and a fair split).\n\n4. **Parameters:** We need parameters to control the relative importance of self-interest and inequity aversion.  A single parameter may not suffice for this, since the model needs the ability to represent a diverse range of human behavior.  Therefore we will use two learnable parameters.\n\n5. **Mapping to Observable Behavior:** The model will predict the utility of accepting an offer based on the proposed amount for the responder (`split_self`) and the perceived unfairness of the offer.  Higher utility values will correspond to a higher probability of acceptance.\n\n\n<MODEL>\nU =  alpha * split_self - beta * abs(split_self - fair_split)\n\nfair_split = combined_earning * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposal.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to self-interest (how much the responder values money).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to inequity aversion (how much the responder dislikes unfairness).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Amount of money proposed to the participant (\u00a3).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"fair_split\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proportionally fair split based on token contributions (\u00a3).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money earned in the trial (\u00a3).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model for responder behavior combining self-interest and inequity aversion.
