fair_split = combined_earning * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp))",A utility model for responder behavior based on self-interest and fairness.  Utility is a function of the proposed monetary amount and a fairness term calculated as a negative function of the absolute difference between a proportionally fair split based on token contributions and the proposed split. The model has two learnable parameters:  `fairness_weight` (weighting of fairness) and `unfairness_sensitivity` (sensitivity to unfairness).,v4,0.5272691653543745,0.6424321675865478,,,,

Utility is a linear function of the proposed amount to the participant, reduced by a term proportional to the absolute difference between the proposed split and a proportionally fair split based on token contributions.

The reference point is calculated as a weighted average of a proportionally fair split, adjusted by the difference in token contributions between the participant and the opponent.
