      "output": "Let me think through this step by step...\n\nThe key psychological mechanisms involved in responder behavior in this economic game are fairness and self-interest.  Responders may accept offers that they perceive as fair, even if they are slightly below their own contribution in terms of tokens (and thus money). Conversely, they are likely to reject offers that they perceive as unfair, even if those offers are financially beneficial.  The degree to which an individual prioritizes fairness over self-interest can vary, depending on individual differences in social preferences.  This could be considered a trade off between these two values.\n\nHow these mechanisms interact: The perceived fairness of an offer interacts with the financial gain from the offer.  A highly unfair offer, even if it yields a high monetary gain, might be rejected. A fairly balanced offer that still provides a positive gain might be accepted. Thus, the interaction involves both a computation of fairness and a weighting of fairness against monetary benefit.\n\nWhat mathematical form could capture these interactions: A simple multiplicative model would capture this interaction. Fairness could be captured by the ratio of the proposed split compared to the contribution ratio of the tokens. We could introduce a parameter representing how much weight is given to fairness relative to the monetary gain.  We will also use the combined earnings, as a fair split is relative to this value.\n\nWhat parameters would be needed to calibrate the model: Two learnable parameters will suffice: one representing the weight given to fairness, and one representing the minimum acceptable percentage of combined earnings before fairness is even considered.\n\nHow the model variables map to observable behavior:  The model predicts the utility of accepting an offer. The higher the utility, the more likely the offer is to be accepted. The model uses the token ratio and monetary gain to calculate a fairness metric and combines this with the financial gain to produce the utility of acceptance. The parameters allow for individual differences in sensitivity to fairness and in the minimum acceptable amount.\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept =  (split_perc_self / ((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100)) * fairness_weight + (split_self / combined_earning) * (1 - fairness_weight) - min_acceptable_perc\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"split_perc_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Percentage of the combined earnings proposed to the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money earned\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1000,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1000,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"fairness_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to fairness relative to self-interest (0 = purely self-interested, 1 = purely fairness-driven)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"min_acceptable_perc\":{\n      \"description\": \"Minimum acceptable percentage of combined earnings before fairness is considered.

Utility is calculated as a weighted average of a fairness term (ratio of received percentage to contribution percentage) and a self-interest term (percentage of combined earnings received). A minimum acceptable percentage parameter accounts for situations where offers might be rejected even if fair due to being too small. The model uses two learnable parameters:  `fairness_weight` and `min_acceptable_perc`.",
  "full_reasoning": "Let me think through this step by step...\n\nThe key psychological mechanisms involved in responder behavior in this economic game are fairness and self-interest.  Responders may accept offers that they perceive as fair, even if they are slightly below their own contribution in terms of tokens (and thus money). Conversely, they are likely to reject offers that they perceive as unfair, even if those offers are financially beneficial.  The degree to which an individual prioritizes fairness over self-interest can vary, depending on individual differences in social preferences.  This could be considered a trade off between these two values.\n\nHow these mechanisms interact: The perceived fairness of an offer interacts with the financial gain from the offer.  A highly unfair offer, even if it yields a high monetary gain, might be rejected. A fairly balanced offer that still provides a positive gain might be accepted. Thus, the interaction involves both a computation of fairness and a weighting of fairness against monetary benefit.\n\nWhat mathematical form could capture these interactions: A simple multiplicative model would capture this interaction. Fairness could be captured by the ratio of the proposed split compared to the contribution ratio of the tokens. We could introduce a parameter representing how much weight is given to fairness relative to the monetary gain.  We will also use the combined earnings, as a fair split is relative to this value.\n\nWhat parameters would be needed to calibrate the model: Two learnable parameters will suffice: one representing the weight given to fairness, and one representing the minimum acceptable percentage of combined earnings before fairness is even considered.\n\nHow the model variables map to observable behavior:  The model predicts the utility of accepting an offer. The higher the utility, the more likely the offer is to be accepted. The model uses the token ratio and monetary gain to calculate a fairness metric and combines this with the financial gain to produce the utility of acceptance. The parameters allow for individual differences in sensitivity to fairness and in the minimum acceptable amount.\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept =  (split_perc_self / ((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100)) * fairness_weight + (split_self / combined_earning) * (1 - fairness_weight) - min_acceptable_perc\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"split_perc_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Percentage of the combined earnings proposed to the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money earned\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1000,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for the participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1000,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"fairness_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to fairness relative to self-interest (0 = purely self-interested, 1 = purely fairness-driven)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"min_acceptable_perc\":{\n      \"description\": \"Minimum acceptable percentage of combined earnings before fairness is considered.
