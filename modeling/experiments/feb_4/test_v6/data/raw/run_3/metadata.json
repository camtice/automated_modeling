      "output": "Let me think through this step by step...\n\nWe need a model that predicts the utility of accepting an offer for responders, focusing on psychological principles and keeping the number of learnable parameters low.  Previous models have explored fairness and self-interest as key drivers. Let's try a model that directly incorporates the perceived fairness of the offer relative to the participant's contribution, alongside the absolute monetary gain.  This avoids the high covariance issue between fairness and self-interest parameters seen in previous models.\n\nThe perceived fairness can be modeled as the ratio of the participant's share to their proportional contribution. A simple way to operationalize this is the ratio of the percentage of earnings received to the percentage of tokens contributed. A higher ratio suggests a fairer offer.\n\nThe model will include a parameter representing sensitivity to fairness, modulating the importance of fairness relative to monetary gain.  This reduces parameter covariance.\n\nThe mathematical form will be a weighted average of these two factors:  a fairness term and a monetary gain term.\n\n**Key Psychological Mechanisms:**\n\n1. **Fairness:** Responders are sensitive to the fairness of the offer, comparing the proportion of earnings received to their proportional contribution to the combined earnings.\n2. **Self-interest:** Responders also prioritize maximizing their monetary gain.\n\n**How these mechanisms interact:**\n\nResponders weigh fairness and self-interest, with the relative weighting varying across individuals.  A high fairness weight implies a stronger preference for fairness, even at the cost of potential monetary gains.\n\n**Mathematical Form:**\n\nThe utility of accepting an offer can be modeled as a weighted sum of a fairness term and a monetary gain term.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\nThe model requires one learnable parameter:  a sensitivity to fairness weight.\n\n**Mapping Model Variables to Observable Behavior:**\n\nThe model's output, the utility of accepting the offer, can be transformed into a probability of acceptance using a softmax function (or a similar function). Higher utility leads to a higher probability of acceptance.\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept =  fairness_weight * (splitperc_self / ((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100)) + (1 - fairness_weight) * split_self\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"fairness_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight representing sensitivity to fairness; higher values indicate stronger preference for fairness.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"splitperc_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Percentage of the combined earnings offered to the participant.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1000,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1000,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Amount of money offered to the participant (\u00a3).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1000,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model for responder behavior in an economic game, combining fairness and self-interest.

The parameter `fairness_weight` is set to a default value of `1` but can be adjusted as needed.\n\n2. **Utility Calculation**:\n   - For each trial, we extract `splitperc_self`, `token_self`, `token_opp`, and `split_self` using the `get` method which defaults to `0` if the key is not found.\n   - We calculate the fairness term only if the sum of `token_self` and `token_opp` is greater than zero to prevent division by zero. If both are zero, the fairness term is set to `0`.\n   - The utility `U_accept` is calculated using the specified formula, which is a weighted combination of the fairness term and the amount offered to the participant.\n\n3. **Results**: The function returns a list of calculated utility values for each trial.\n\nMake sure you adjust the input data structure according to your source JSON to work seamlessly with this function."

Utility is a weighted average of perceived fairness (ratio of received percentage to contribution percentage) and monetary gain. The model uses one learnable parameter: `fairness_weight`, representing the relative importance of fairness.",
  "full_reasoning": "Let me think through this step by step...\n\nWe need a model that predicts the utility of accepting an offer for responders, focusing on psychological principles and keeping the number of learnable parameters low.  Previous models have explored fairness and self-interest as key drivers. Let's try a model that directly incorporates the perceived fairness of the offer relative to the participant's contribution, alongside the absolute monetary gain.  This avoids the high covariance issue between fairness and self-interest parameters seen in previous models.\n\nThe perceived fairness can be modeled as the ratio of the participant's share to their proportional contribution. A simple way to operationalize this is the ratio of the percentage of earnings received to the percentage of tokens contributed. A higher ratio suggests a fairer offer.\n\nThe model will include a parameter representing sensitivity to fairness, modulating the importance of fairness relative to monetary gain.  This reduces parameter covariance.\n\nThe mathematical form will be a weighted average of these two factors:  a fairness term and a monetary gain term.\n\n**Key Psychological Mechanisms:**\n\n1. **Fairness:** Responders are sensitive to the fairness of the offer, comparing the proportion of earnings received to their proportional contribution to the combined earnings.\n2. **Self-interest:** Responders also prioritize maximizing their monetary gain.\n\n**How these mechanisms interact:**\n\nResponders weigh fairness and self-interest, with the relative weighting varying across individuals.  A high fairness weight implies a stronger preference for fairness, even at the cost of potential monetary gains.\n\n**Mathematical Form:**\n\nThe utility of accepting an offer can be modeled as a weighted sum of a fairness term and a monetary gain term.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\nThe model requires one learnable parameter:  a sensitivity to fairness weight.\n\n**Mapping Model Variables to Observable Behavior:**\n\nThe model's output, the utility of accepting the offer, can be transformed into a probability of acceptance using a softmax function (or a similar function). Higher utility leads to a higher probability of acceptance.\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept =  fairness_weight * (splitperc_self / ((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100)) + (1 - fairness_weight) * split_self\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"fairness_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight representing sensitivity to fairness; higher values indicate stronger preference for fairness.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"splitperc_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Percentage of the combined earnings offered to the participant.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1000,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1000,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Amount of money offered to the participant (\u00a3).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1000,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model for responder behavior in an economic game, combining fairness and self-interest.
