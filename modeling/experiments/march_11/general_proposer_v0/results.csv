1,,,,U = -alpha * (proposed_perc - (100 * token_opp/(token_self + token_opp) + delta))^2,"A quadratic utility model for proposer behavior that penalizes deviations from a fairness norm computed as 100 * token_opp/(token_self+token_opp), shifted by a bias (delta). The model has two learnable parameters: alpha (sensitivity to fairness deviations) and delta (systematic bias). Utility is calculated solely for proposer actions, and the model predicts the proposerâ€™s proposed percentage offer.",v0
