1,71.59497313352489,,,U_accept = gamma + alpha * (split_self - combined_earning * (token_self/(token_self+token_opp))),A linear utility model for responders that computes acceptance utility as a baseline plus a sensitivity-weighted difference between the offered share and a fairness benchmark. The fairness benchmark is determined by the participantâ€™s proportional contribution to the total earnings. The model features two learnable parameters: baseline bias gamma and fairness sensitivity alpha.,v0,0.8022743352439792,0.4551577706258867
