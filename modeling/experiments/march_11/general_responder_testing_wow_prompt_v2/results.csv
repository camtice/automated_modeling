1,111.95511591957441,,,"U = bias + split_self - alpha * max((token_self/(token_self+token_opp))*combined_earning - split_self,0)",A utility model for responder behavior that combines monetary gain (split_self) with a fairness check. The model computes the expected fair share based on token contributions and penalizes offers that fall short of this benchmark by an amount proportional to a learnable inequity sensitivity parameter (alpha) and an added baseline bias (bias).,v2,0.8822455147690536,0.18822513752392184
