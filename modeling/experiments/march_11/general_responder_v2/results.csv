1,,,,U = alpha + gamma * (((100 - proposed_perc)/100) * combined_earning) - delta * (proposed_perc - (token_opp/(token_self + token_opp))*100)^2,"A utility model for proposer behavior where the utility of an offer is determined by a weighted monetary reward based on the percentage kept by the proposer and a quadratic penalty for deviating from the fairness benchmark determined by token contributions. The model includes three learnable parameters: a baseline offset (alpha), reward sensitivity (gamma), and fairness sensitivity (delta).",v2
