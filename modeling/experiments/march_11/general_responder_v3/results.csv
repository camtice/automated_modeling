P(accept) = 1/(1+exp(-U))","A binary choice model for responder behavior where the fairness norm is computed from pretask token outcomes and shifted by a learnable bias parameter. The difference between the observed offer (splitperc_self) and the adjusted fairness norm determines the acceptance utility via a sensitivity parameter and an intercept. The utility is converted to an acceptance probability using a logistic function, with the same fairness norm representing the predicted proposed percentage in the proposer context.",v3,0.10551002444826386,0.022159898459416134,0.06860765816979023
