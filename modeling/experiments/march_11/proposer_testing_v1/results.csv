1,99.8710883151703,,,"U = split_self - lambda_param * max(0, (combined_earning * token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) - split_self)",A utility model for responder behavior where the acceptance utility is calculated as the monetary amount received (split_self) minus a fairness penalty. The penalty is applied only when the received share is below the fairness benchmark (computed as combined_earning multiplied by the ratio of token_self to the total tokens). This model incorporates one learnable parameter (lambda_param) that modulates sensitivity to deviations from fairness.,v1,0.8584840303806188
