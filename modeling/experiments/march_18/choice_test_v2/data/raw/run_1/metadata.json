  "task_description": "Participants played 320 games (in four blocks of 80 games) of our Horizon task (see Figure\n1A). Each game lasted either five or 10 trials and the two game lengths were interleaved and\ncounter-balanced such that there were 160 games of each length.\nIn each game, participants made repeated decisions between two options. Each option paid\nout between 1 and 100 points that was sampled (rounded to the nearest integer) from a\nGaussian distribution with a fixed standard deviation of 8 points. The generative means of\nthe underlying Gaussians were different for the two options and remained stable within a\ngame. In each game, the mean of one option was set to either 40 or 60 points and the mean\nof the other was set relative to the mean of the first, such that the difference between the two\nwas sampled from 4, 8, 12, 20, and 30. Both the identity and the difference in means were\ncounterbalanced over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were instructed in the task with the use of a set of illustrated onscreen\ninstructions. These explicitly conveyed that the means of the two options were constant over\na game and that the variability in the options was constant over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were told to maximize the points they earned and that one option was always\nbetter on average. The full text of the instructions is provided in the Supplementary Material.\nChoice and outcome history in each game remained onscreen inside each of the slot\nmachines (Figure 1A). After a particular option was played, the reward on that trial was\nadded to the slot machine, whereas the corresponding space for the unplayed option was\nfilled with an \u201cXX.\u201d\nThe first four trials of each game were forced-choice trials, in which only one of the options\n(cued by a green square inside the next available space) was available for participants to\nchoose. We used these forced-choice trials to manipulate the information participants had\nabout the two options from experience (Hertwig, Barron, Weber, & Erev, 2004) before their\nfirst free choice, while maintaining their active engagement in the task. The four forcedchoice trials set up two information conditions: \u201cunequal information\u201d (or [1 3]), in which\none option was forced to be played once and the other three times, and \u201cequal information\u201d\n(or [2 2]), in which each option was forced to be played twice.\nCrucially, this manipulation ensured that participants were exposed to a specified amount of\ninformation about each option, regardless of how rewarding it was. Furthermore, the relative\namount of information provided about each option was independent of the relative difference\nin their means. Thus on the first free choice (the fifth trial in each game), the difference in\nthe number of times each option had been sampled (and hence the difference in available\ninformation) had no effect on the difference in mean payout of that option (repeatedmeasures ANOVA,\nF(2, 89) = 0.09,\np = .91) thus removing the reward\u2013information\nconfound on this trial.\nAfter the forced-choice trials, participants made either one or six free choices (Figure 1B).\nAt the beginning of each game, the number of upcoming free-choice trials (i.e., the horizon)\n\n\nBelow is the description of each variable in the dataset, which will be followed by information about the data type of the variable:\n\nparticipant = [Unique identifier for each human subject in the experiment]\ntask = [Identifier for the specific game/round the participant is playing]\ntrial = [Sequential number indicating which decision point this is within a game]\nchoice = [The option (0 or 1) that the participant selected on this trial]\nreward = [The number of points (1-100) received after making a choice]\nRT = [Reaction time measuring how long it took the participant to make their decision]\nexpected_reward0 = [The observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous forced/free plays]\nexpected_reward1 = [The observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous forced/free plays]\nforced_choice = [Boolean indicator of whether this was a forced-choice trial (1) or free-choice trial (0)]\nhorizon = [The number of free choices available in the current game (either 1 or 6)]\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- Unnamed: 0 (int64)\n- ID (int64)\n- task (int64)\n- trial (int64)\n- choice (int64)\n- reward (float64)\n- RT (float64)\n- expected_reward0 (int64)\n- expected_reward1 (int64)\n- forced_choice (bool)\n- horizon (int64)\n\nNumber of observations: 144000\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- Unnamed: 0 (int64)\n- ID (int64)\n- task (int64)\n- trial (int64)\n- choice (int64)\n- reward (float64)\n- RT (float64)\n- expected_reward0 (int64)\n- expected_reward1 (int64)\n- forced_choice (bool)\n- horizon (int64)\n\nNumber of observations: 144000",

In equal conditions both options are sampled twice.\n\u2022 The interaction: the final utility for each option is determined by its observed (expected) reward plus, when the horizon is long, an exploration bonus that increases with the option\u2019s uncertainty (i.e. inversely proportional to its forced\u2010choice count).\n\u2022 A logistic choice rule then transforms the difference in utilities into a probability of selecting an option.\n\nMathematical form:\n\u2022 Let H = 1 when the game horizon is long (horizon = 6 free choices) and 0 otherwise.\n\u2022 For each option i \u2208 {0,1}, define the utility as:\n\u2003\u2003U\u1d62 = expected_reward\u1d62 + H \u00b7 exploration_weight \u00b7 (sigma/\u221a(n\u1d62))\n\u2003\u2003where sigma = 8 (the fixed standard deviation for outcomes) and n\u1d62 is the count of forced (information) trials for option i.\n\u2022 The choice probability is given by a logistic function over the difference in utilities scaled by an inverse temperature parameter beta:\n\u2003\u2003P(choice = 1) = 1/(1 + exp(\u2013 beta \u00b7 [U\u2081 \u2013 U\u2080]))\n\nParameters to be calibrated:\n\u2022 beta (inverse temperature): determines sensitivity to utility differences.

Its range is finite, for example (0, 100).\n\nMapping to observable behavior:\n\u2022 The model uses the provided expected_reward0 and expected_reward1 values.\n\u2022 The forced-choice trials (when forced_choice is True) yield the counts n\u2080 and n\u2081; these counts are aggregated per game from the earlier forced-choice trials.\n\u2022 The horizon variable determines whether an exploration bonus is applied.\n\u2022 The model predicts the binary free-choice decision (variable 'choice') using a logistic function applied to the computed utility difference.\n\nBelow is the formal mathematical model specification and learnable variable descriptions.\n\n<MODEL>\nH = I(horizon = 6)\nU_0 = expected_reward0 + H * exploration_weight * (8 / sqrt(n0))\nU_1 = expected_reward1 + H * exploration_weight * (8 / sqrt(n1))\nP(choice = 1) = 1 / (1 + exp(- beta * (U_1 - U_0)))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Inverse temperature parameter controlling sensitivity to utility differences\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.001,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"lower\": 0.001,\n          \"upper\": 20\n        }\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"exploration_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Exploration bonus weight controlling the influence of uncertainty\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"lower\": 0,\n          \"upper\": 100\n        }\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed (sample) mean reward for option 0\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed (sample) mean reward for option 1\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"n0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of forced-choice samples for option 0 within the current game\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 320,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"n1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of forced-choice samples for option 1 within the current game\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 320,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"horizon\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of free-choice trials available in the game (1 or 6)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"choice\": {\n      \"description\": \"Binary decision variable; 1 indicates option 1 is chosen, 0 indicates option 0 is chosen\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"8\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fixed sampling standard deviation for the outcomes\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 8,\n        \"max\": 8,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"fixed\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>choice</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA binary choice model in which the utility of each option is a sum of its observed reward and an exploration bonus proportional to its uncertainty (inferred from the forced-choice counts), with the exploration bonus applied only when the horizon is long.

  "full_reasoning": "Step 1. Reasoning\n\nKey psychological mechanisms:\n\u2022 Exploitation: Participants tend to choose the option with a higher observed (sampled) mean reward.\n\u2022 Exploration: When there are many future opportunities (high horizon), participants may choose the option with higher uncertainty even if its observed mean is lower.\n\u2022 Uncertainty in this task is manipulated via forced-choice trials: in unequal conditions one option is sampled once (high uncertainty) and the other three times (low uncertainty). In equal conditions both options are sampled twice.\n\u2022 The interaction: the final utility for each option is determined by its observed (expected) reward plus, when the horizon is long, an exploration bonus that increases with the option\u2019s uncertainty (i.e. inversely proportional to its forced\u2010choice count).\n\u2022 A logistic choice rule then transforms the difference in utilities into a probability of selecting an option.\n\nMathematical form:\n\u2022 Let H = 1 when the game horizon is long (horizon = 6 free choices) and 0 otherwise.\n\u2022 For each option i \u2208 {0,1}, define the utility as:\n\u2003\u2003U\u1d62 = expected_reward\u1d62 + H \u00b7 exploration_weight \u00b7 (sigma/\u221a(n\u1d62))\n\u2003\u2003where sigma = 8 (the fixed standard deviation for outcomes) and n\u1d62 is the count of forced (information) trials for option i.\n\u2022 The choice probability is given by a logistic function over the difference in utilities scaled by an inverse temperature parameter beta:\n\u2003\u2003P(choice = 1) = 1/(1 + exp(\u2013 beta \u00b7 [U\u2081 \u2013 U\u2080]))\n\nParameters to be calibrated:\n\u2022 beta (inverse temperature): determines sensitivity to utility differences. Its range is finite and is set to be, for example, (0.001, 20).\n\u2022 exploration_weight: modulates the bonus given to an option\u2019s uncertainty (i.e., its higher standard error when fewer forced trials are sampled). Its range is finite, for example (0, 100).\n\nMapping to observable behavior:\n\u2022 The model uses the provided expected_reward0 and expected_reward1 values.\n\u2022 The forced-choice trials (when forced_choice is True) yield the counts n\u2080 and n\u2081; these counts are aggregated per game from the earlier forced-choice trials.\n\u2022 The horizon variable determines whether an exploration bonus is applied.\n\u2022 The model predicts the binary free-choice decision (variable 'choice') using a logistic function applied to the computed utility difference.\n\nBelow is the formal mathematical model specification and learnable variable descriptions.\n\n<MODEL>\nH = I(horizon = 6)\nU_0 = expected_reward0 + H * exploration_weight * (8 / sqrt(n0))\nU_1 = expected_reward1 + H * exploration_weight * (8 / sqrt(n1))\nP(choice = 1) = 1 / (1 + exp(- beta * (U_1 - U_0)))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Inverse temperature parameter controlling sensitivity to utility differences\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.001,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"lower\": 0.001,\n          \"upper\": 20\n        }\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"exploration_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Exploration bonus weight controlling the influence of uncertainty\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"lower\": 0,\n          \"upper\": 100\n        }\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed (sample) mean reward for option 0\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed (sample) mean reward for option 1\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"n0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of forced-choice samples for option 0 within the current game\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 320,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"n1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of forced-choice samples for option 1 within the current game\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 320,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"horizon\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of free-choice trials available in the game (1 or 6)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"choice\": {\n      \"description\": \"Binary decision variable; 1 indicates option 1 is chosen, 0 indicates option 0 is chosen\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"8\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fixed sampling standard deviation for the outcomes\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 8,\n        \"max\": 8,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"fixed\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>choice</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA binary choice model in which the utility of each option is a sum of its observed reward and an exploration bonus proportional to its uncertainty (inferred from the forced-choice counts), with the exploration bonus applied only when the horizon is long.
