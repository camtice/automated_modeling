1,,,,U = beta0 + beta_exploit*(expected_reward1 - expected_reward0) - beta_explore*((forced_count1) - (forced_count0)) + beta_horizon*I(horizon == 6),"A linear utility model for free-choice trials that combines exploitation via the difference in observed expected rewards, an exploration bonus inversely related to the number of forced-choice samples per option, and an additive bonus for long-horizon games. Four learnable parameters govern the weighting of these factors.",v5
