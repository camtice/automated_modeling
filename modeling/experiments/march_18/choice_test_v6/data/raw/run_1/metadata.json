  "task_description": "Participants played 320 games (in four blocks of 80 games) of our Horizon task (see Figure\n1A). Each game lasted either five or 10 trials and the two game lengths were interleaved and\ncounter-balanced such that there were 160 games of each length.\nIn each game, participants made repeated decisions between two options. Each option paid\nout between 1 and 100 points that was sampled (rounded to the nearest integer) from a\nGaussian distribution with a fixed standard deviation of 8 points. The generative means of\nthe underlying Gaussians were different for the two options and remained stable within a\ngame. In each game, the mean of one option was set to either 40 or 60 points and the mean\nof the other was set relative to the mean of the first, such that the difference between the two\nwas sampled from 4, 8, 12, 20, and 30. Both the identity and the difference in means were\ncounterbalanced over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were instructed in the task with the use of a set of illustrated onscreen\ninstructions. These explicitly conveyed that the means of the two options were constant over\na game and that the variability in the options was constant over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were told to maximize the points they earned and that one option was always\nbetter on average. The full text of the instructions is provided in the Supplementary Material.\nChoice and outcome history in each game remained onscreen inside each of the slot\nmachines (Figure 1A). After a particular option was played, the reward on that trial was\nadded to the slot machine, whereas the corresponding space for the unplayed option was\nfilled with an \u201cXX.\u201d\nThe first four trials of each game were forced-choice trials, in which only one of the options\n(cued by a green square inside the next available space) was available for participants to\nchoose. We used these forced-choice trials to manipulate the information participants had\nabout the two options from experience (Hertwig, Barron, Weber, & Erev, 2004) before their\nfirst free choice, while maintaining their active engagement in the task. The four forcedchoice trials set up two information conditions: \u201cunequal information\u201d (or [1 3]), in which\none option was forced to be played once and the other three times, and \u201cequal information\u201d\n(or [2 2]), in which each option was forced to be played twice.\nCrucially, this manipulation ensured that participants were exposed to a specified amount of\ninformation about each option, regardless of how rewarding it was. Furthermore, the relative\namount of information provided about each option was independent of the relative difference\nin their means. Thus on the first free choice (the fifth trial in each game), the difference in\nthe number of times each option had been sampled (and hence the difference in available\ninformation) had no effect on the difference in mean payout of that option (repeatedmeasures ANOVA,\nF(2, 89) = 0.09,\np = .91) thus removing the reward\u2013information\nconfound on this trial.\nAfter the forced-choice trials, participants made either one or six free choices (Figure 1B).\nAt the beginning of each game, the number of upcoming free-choice trials (i.e., the horizon)\n\n\nBelow is the description of each variable in the dataset, which will be followed by information about the data type of the variable:\n\nparticipant = [Unique identifier for each human subject in the experiment]\ntask = [Identifier for the specific game/round the participant is playing]\ntrial = [Sequential number indicating which decision point this is within a game]\nchoice = [The option (0 or 1) that the participant selected on this trial]\nreward = [The number of points (1-100) received after making a choice]\nRT = [Reaction time measuring how long it took the participant to make their decision]\nexpected_reward0 = [The observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous forced/free plays]\nexpected_reward1 = [The observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous forced/free plays]\nforced_choice = [Boolean indicator of whether this was a forced-choice trial (1) or free-choice trial (0)]\nhorizon = [The number of free choices available in the current game (either 1 or 6)]\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- Unnamed: 0 (int64)\n- ID (int64)\n- task (int64)\n- trial (int64)\n- choice (int64)\n- reward (float64)\n- RT (float64)\n- expected_reward0 (int64)\n- expected_reward1 (int64)\n- forced_choice (bool)\n- horizon (int64)\n\nNumber of observations: 144000\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- Unnamed: 0 (int64)\n- ID (int64)\n- task (int64)\n- trial (int64)\n- choice (int64)\n- reward (float64)\n- RT (float64)\n- expected_reward0 (int64)\n- expected_reward1 (int64)\n- forced_choice (bool)\n- horizon (int64)\n\nNumber of observations: 144000",

      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\u2022 Key psychological mechanisms: Participants use observed outcomes (expected rewards from forced/free plays) to gauge the value of each option. In longer horizon games (more free choices) they are more inclined to explore, which effectively increases the weight given to differences in expected reward. In short horizon games, they rely more on immediate exploitation.\n\u2022 Interaction: The model assumes that the utility difference between the two options is given by the difference in their observed expected rewards scaled by a sensitivity parameter. When the horizon is long, an added exploration bonus increases this effective sensitivity.\n\u2022 Mathematical form: A linear model is used where the utility difference is a product of a \u201csensitivity\u201d factor (which adds an exploration bonus in long horizon games) and the difference in expected rewards.\n\u2022 Needed parameters: Two learnable parameters are used. One (beta_exploit) represents the baseline sensitivity for exploitation and the other (beta_explore) represents the additional sensitivity (exploration bonus) when there are many free choices (horizon = 6). Their bounds are set generously (e.g., [\u2013100, 100]).\n\u2022 Mapping to observable behavior: The computed utility difference, which is the model\u2019s prediction, will later be transformed by a logistic function to generate a choice probability for the free\u2010choice trials.

  "target_variable": "choice",
  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\u2022 Key psychological mechanisms: Participants use observed outcomes (expected rewards from forced/free plays) to gauge the value of each option. In longer horizon games (more free choices) they are more inclined to explore, which effectively increases the weight given to differences in expected reward. In short horizon games, they rely more on immediate exploitation.\n\u2022 Interaction: The model assumes that the utility difference between the two options is given by the difference in their observed expected rewards scaled by a sensitivity parameter. When the horizon is long, an added exploration bonus increases this effective sensitivity.\n\u2022 Mathematical form: A linear model is used where the utility difference is a product of a \u201csensitivity\u201d factor (which adds an exploration bonus in long horizon games) and the difference in expected rewards.\n\u2022 Needed parameters: Two learnable parameters are used. One (beta_exploit) represents the baseline sensitivity for exploitation and the other (beta_explore) represents the additional sensitivity (exploration bonus) when there are many free choices (horizon = 6). Their bounds are set generously (e.g., [\u2013100, 100]).\n\u2022 Mapping to observable behavior: The computed utility difference, which is the model\u2019s prediction, will later be transformed by a logistic function to generate a choice probability for the free\u2010choice trials. Our model directly predicts the utility (to be used later for probability mapping) on free-choice trials (where forced_choice == FALSE).\n\nBelow is the formal model specification.\n\n<MODEL>\nU = (beta_exploit + beta_explore * I_horizon) * (expected_reward1 - expected_reward0)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Predicted utility difference between option 1 and option 0.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta_exploit\": {\n      \"description\": \"Baseline value sensitivity parameter that weighs the difference in expected rewards in short horizon games.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -100,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta_explore\": {\n      \"description\": \"Exploration bonus parameter that increases the sensitivity to expected reward differences in long horizon games (horizon 6).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -100,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"I_horizon\": {\n      \"description\": \"Indicator variable for long horizon games; equals 1 if horizon equals 6 (long horizon), and 0 if horizon equals 1 (short horizon).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous forced/free plays.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous forced/free plays.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>choice</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA linear utility-difference model that computes the utility of a free-choice trial as the product of a value sensitivity term (comprising a baseline exploitation parameter and an additional exploration bonus for long horizon trials) and the difference between the observed mean rewards of the two options.\n</SUMMARY>",
