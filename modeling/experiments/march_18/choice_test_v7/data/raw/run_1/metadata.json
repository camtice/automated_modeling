  "task_description": "Participants played 320 games (in four blocks of 80 games) of our Horizon task (see Figure\n1A). Each game lasted either five or 10 trials and the two game lengths were interleaved and\ncounter-balanced such that there were 160 games of each length.\nIn each game, participants made repeated decisions between two options. Each option paid\nout between 1 and 100 points that was sampled (rounded to the nearest integer) from a\nGaussian distribution with a fixed standard deviation of 8 points. The generative means of\nthe underlying Gaussians were different for the two options and remained stable within a\ngame. In each game, the mean of one option was set to either 40 or 60 points and the mean\nof the other was set relative to the mean of the first, such that the difference between the two\nwas sampled from 4, 8, 12, 20, and 30. Both the identity and the difference in means were\ncounterbalanced over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were instructed in the task with the use of a set of illustrated onscreen\ninstructions. These explicitly conveyed that the means of the two options were constant over\na game and that the variability in the options was constant over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were told to maximize the points they earned and that one option was always\nbetter on average. The full text of the instructions is provided in the Supplementary Material.\nChoice and outcome history in each game remained onscreen inside each of the slot\nmachines (Figure 1A). After a particular option was played, the reward on that trial was\nadded to the slot machine, whereas the corresponding space for the unplayed option was\nfilled with an \u201cXX.\u201d\nThe first four trials of each game were forced-choice trials, in which only one of the options\n(cued by a green square inside the next available space) was available for participants to\nchoose. We used these forced-choice trials to manipulate the information participants had\nabout the two options from experience (Hertwig, Barron, Weber, & Erev, 2004) before their\nfirst free choice, while maintaining their active engagement in the task. The four forcedchoice trials set up two information conditions: \u201cunequal information\u201d (or [1 3]), in which\none option was forced to be played once and the other three times, and \u201cequal information\u201d\n(or [2 2]), in which each option was forced to be played twice.\nCrucially, this manipulation ensured that participants were exposed to a specified amount of\ninformation about each option, regardless of how rewarding it was. Furthermore, the relative\namount of information provided about each option was independent of the relative difference\nin their means. Thus on the first free choice (the fifth trial in each game), the difference in\nthe number of times each option had been sampled (and hence the difference in available\ninformation) had no effect on the difference in mean payout of that option (repeatedmeasures ANOVA,\nF(2, 89) = 0.09,\np = .91) thus removing the reward\u2013information\nconfound on this trial.\nAfter the forced-choice trials, participants made either one or six free choices (Figure 1B).\nAt the beginning of each game, the number of upcoming free-choice trials (i.e., the horizon)\n\n\nBelow is the description of each variable in the dataset, which will be followed by information about the data type of the variable:\n\nparticipant = [Unique identifier for each human subject in the experiment]\ntask = [Identifier for the specific game/round the participant is playing]\ntrial = [Sequential number indicating which decision point this is within a game]\nchoice = [The option (0 or 1) that the participant selected on this trial]\nreward = [The number of points (1-100) received after making a choice]\nRT = [Reaction time measuring how long it took the participant to make their decision]\nexpected_reward0 = [The observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous forced/free plays]\nexpected_reward1 = [The observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous forced/free plays]\nforced_choice = [Boolean indicator of whether this was a forced-choice trial (1) or free-choice trial (0)]\nhorizon = [The number of free choices available in the current game (either 1 or 6)]\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- Unnamed: 0 (int64)\n- ID (int64)\n- task (int64)\n- trial (int64)\n- choice (int64)\n- reward (float64)\n- RT (float64)\n- expected_reward0 (int64)\n- expected_reward1 (int64)\n- forced_choice (bool)\n- horizon (int64)\n\nNumber of observations: 144000\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- Unnamed: 0 (int64)\n- ID (int64)\n- task (int64)\n- trial (int64)\n- choice (int64)\n- reward (float64)\n- RT (float64)\n- expected_reward0 (int64)\n- expected_reward1 (int64)\n- forced_choice (bool)\n- horizon (int64)\n\nNumber of observations: 144000",

      "output": "Below is a step\u2010by\u2010step explanation of the reasoning behind the model design:\n\n1. Key Psychological Mechanisms:\n\u2003\u2022 Participants compare options using the reward information gathered during the forced\u2010choice phase. In other words, they use the observed sample means (expected_reward0 and expected_reward1) as proxies for the options\u2019 true values.\n\u2003\u2022 In addition to the learned reward values, participants may also factor in \u201cinformation bonus\u201d or uncertainty about each option \u2013 they may favor the option that has been sampled less (hence more uncertain) when future choices (horizon) allow for exploration.\n\u2003\u2022 Finally, a baseline bias (or intercept) may shift overall utility differences.\n\n2. How these Mechanisms Interact:\n\u2003\u2022 The exploitation component relies on the difference in the observed means of the two options.\n\u2003\u2022 The exploration component reflects the inverse relationship between the number of samples and uncertainty. We assume that fewer samples mean higher uncertainty; mathematically, the uncertainty bonus for an option can be approximated by 1/sqrt(n) \u2013 where n is the number of forced samples the option received. (n is computed from the forced-choice trials in the game; by design, this is either 1 or 2 vs. 3 or 2.) In free-choice trials these counts can be computed from the history within the game.\n\u2003\u2022 The exploration bonus is further modulated by the horizon (number of upcoming free choices); when more choices are available participants can afford to explore more.\n\n3. Mathematical Form:\n\u2003\u2022 Define n0 and n1 as the number of forced-play samples for option 0 and option 1 respectively. (These are \u201ccalculated\u201d from the first four trial history in the game.)\n\u2003\u2022 The utility difference (U) between options (say, option 1 relative to option 0) is then given by a weighted sum:\n\u2003\u2003U = intercept + beta_reward*(expected_reward1 \u2013 expected_reward0) + beta_info*horizon*((1/sqrt(n1)) \u2013 (1/sqrt(n0))).\n\u2003\u2022 This formulation naturally produces a scalar \u201cutility\u201d that is then passed through a logistic function externally to yield a probability.

  "full_reasoning": "Below is a step\u2010by\u2010step explanation of the reasoning behind the model design:\n\n1. Key Psychological Mechanisms:\n\u2003\u2022 Participants compare options using the reward information gathered during the forced\u2010choice phase. In other words, they use the observed sample means (expected_reward0 and expected_reward1) as proxies for the options\u2019 true values.\n\u2003\u2022 In addition to the learned reward values, participants may also factor in \u201cinformation bonus\u201d or uncertainty about each option \u2013 they may favor the option that has been sampled less (hence more uncertain) when future choices (horizon) allow for exploration.\n\u2003\u2022 Finally, a baseline bias (or intercept) may shift overall utility differences.\n\n2. How these Mechanisms Interact:\n\u2003\u2022 The exploitation component relies on the difference in the observed means of the two options.\n\u2003\u2022 The exploration component reflects the inverse relationship between the number of samples and uncertainty. We assume that fewer samples mean higher uncertainty; mathematically, the uncertainty bonus for an option can be approximated by 1/sqrt(n) \u2013 where n is the number of forced samples the option received. (n is computed from the forced-choice trials in the game; by design, this is either 1 or 2 vs. 3 or 2.) In free-choice trials these counts can be computed from the history within the game.\n\u2003\u2022 The exploration bonus is further modulated by the horizon (number of upcoming free choices); when more choices are available participants can afford to explore more.\n\n3. Mathematical Form:\n\u2003\u2022 Define n0 and n1 as the number of forced-play samples for option 0 and option 1 respectively. (These are \u201ccalculated\u201d from the first four trial history in the game.)\n\u2003\u2022 The utility difference (U) between options (say, option 1 relative to option 0) is then given by a weighted sum:\n\u2003\u2003U = intercept + beta_reward*(expected_reward1 \u2013 expected_reward0) + beta_info*horizon*((1/sqrt(n1)) \u2013 (1/sqrt(n0))).\n\u2003\u2022 This formulation naturally produces a scalar \u201cutility\u201d that is then passed through a logistic function externally to yield a probability. In our specification, the model predicts UTILITY (not probability) so that the decision function later applied is: choice probability = logistic(U).\n\n4. Parameters Needed:\n\u2003\u2022 beta_reward \u2013 sensitivity to the reward difference (learnable, with generous bounds, e.g. from 0 to 10).\n\u2003\u2022 beta_info \u2013 sensitivity to the exploration bonus (learnable, with bounds, e.g. from -10 to 10; note that the sign can be positive if opting for exploration or negative if risk averse).\n\u2003\u2022 intercept \u2013 a baseline bias parameter (learnable, bounded e.g. between -10 and 10).\n\u2003\u2022 n0 and n1 are calculated from the forced-choice part of the game and are not learnable.\n\n5. Mapping Model Variables to Observables:\n\u2003\u2022 expected_reward0 and expected_reward1 come directly from the dataset.\n\u2003\u2022 horizon is provided in the dataset.\n\u2003\u2022 The forced_choice flag and trial order allow you to compute n0 and n1 for each game (source: calculated from forced-choice trials).\n\u2003\u2022 The choice variable (target) is 0 or 1 (only in free-choice trial, i.e. forced_choice==FALSE) and is predicted via the utility difference computed above.\n\nBelow is the formal specification.\n\n<MODEL>\nU = intercept + beta_reward*(expected_reward1 - expected_reward0) + beta_info*horizon*((1/sqrt(n1)) - (1/sqrt(n0)))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Predicted utility difference (option1 utility minus option0 utility) for a free-choice trial\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"horizon\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of upcoming free-choice trials in the current game\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"n0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of forced-choice samples for option 0 in the current game (calculated from forced_choice trials)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 3,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"n1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of forced-choice samples for option 1 in the current game (calculated from forced_choice trials)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 3,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta_reward\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to the difference in expected rewards between options\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta_info\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to the information bonus (exploration component) modulated by horizon\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"intercept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Baseline bias term\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>choice</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA linear utility model for free-choice decisions that combines an exploitation term based on the difference in observed expected rewards and an exploration term based on the information uncertainty (computed as the inverse square root of forced-play counts) modulated by the horizon length, with an intercept bias.

The model uses three learnable parameters: beta_reward, beta_info, and intercept.\nTarget Variable: choice\nPrediction Type: numerical_variable_estimation\nBIC: 2262.531060659483\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- beta_reward: r = 1.000\n- beta_info: r = 0.055\n- intercept: r = 1.000"
