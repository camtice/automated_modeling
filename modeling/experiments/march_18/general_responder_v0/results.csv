The utility derived from an offer is modeled as a linear function of the offered amount augmented by a bonus when the offer exceeds the fair share and penalized when it falls short. The resulting utility is scaled by an inverse temperature parameter and transformed via a logistic function to yield the probability of accepting the offer.,v0,0.015289018534467028,0.07647373278252777,-0.11364976759719334,0.14971905919465894,0.23868465309216652,,
