1,462.3919752209487,,,proposed_perc = 100/(1 + exp( - (alpha + beta*(token_opp - token_self) ) )),"A logistic model where the proposed percentage for the opponent is determined by a baseline parameter (alpha) and a sensitivity parameter (beta) acting on the token difference (token_opp minus token_self). The logistic transformation scales the latent utility into a probability, which is then multiplied by 100 to yield a proposal percentage.",v2,0.5196396731620597,0.3637337546155446
