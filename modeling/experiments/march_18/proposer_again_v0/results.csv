The first component weights the opponentâ€™s token ratio (reflecting an equality or fairness norm), while the second weights the difference between opponent and self tokens (capturing asymmetries in contributions). An additive normally distributed noise epsilon (with learnable standard deviation sigma) accounts for unexplained variance. This simple model minimizes parameter count and mitigates covariance issues through independent bounded learnable parameters.",v0,0.10125336109330384,0.31943394893436644,0.31031155398581195,0.015188447399534562
