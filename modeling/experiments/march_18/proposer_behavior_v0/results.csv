proposed_perc = 100 / (1 + exp(-U))","A logistic model that predicts the percentage offered to an opponent in proposer trials. The model computes a utility as a linear combination of an intercept, the proportion of tokens acquired by the participant, and the logarithm of the combined earning. This utility is then transformed via a logistic function and scaled to produce the predicted proposed percentage.",v0,0.06814724915586332,0.12293022578116623,0.5280507050760528,,,

A logistic function, applied to a utility difference that depends on the difference between the fair share and the baseline offer, yields a mixing weight that determines the final proposed percentage.",v0,,,,0.07414620707505504,-0.0037624422318043027,0.09102211658658155
