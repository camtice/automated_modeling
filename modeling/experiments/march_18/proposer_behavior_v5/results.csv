1,,,,predicted_proposed_perc = 50 + lambda_param * ((100 * token_opp/(token_self + token_opp)) - 50),"A single-parameter model that predicts the proposed percentage for the opponent as a weighted blend of an equal split (50%) and the fairness ratio derived from the participant’s and opponent’s tokens. The sole learnable parameter (lambda_param, bounded between –10 and 10) controls the sensitivity to deviation from an equal split.",v5
