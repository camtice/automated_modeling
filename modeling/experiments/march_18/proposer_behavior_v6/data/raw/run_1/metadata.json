      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. The key psychological mechanisms include fairness evaluation and an intrinsic bias toward equal splits. In the proposer role, participants may adjust the fair share they offer, which according to token counts is computed as the opponent\u2019s tokens divided by the total tokens. However, they might \u201canchor\u201d toward an equal (50%) offer independent of the tokens.\n2. These mechanisms interact in that the final proposal is a weighted combination of the fairness-perceived share (based on tokens) and the equal split benchmark.\n3. A suitable mathematical form is a weighted average between the fair share (derived as token_opp/(token_self + token_opp)) and an equal split (50%). The weights are determined by a single parameter.\n4. The only learnable parameter, theta, (with bounds 0 to 1) modulates between relying on fairness (when theta is 0) versus an equality bias (when theta is 1).\n5. The model variables: token_opp and token_self come from the data; the fairness share is token_opp/(token_self + token_opp)*100, and the final predicted proposed percentage offered to the opponent is: theta multiplied by 50 plus (1 \u2013 theta) multiplied by the fairness share.\n\nBelow is the formal model followed by variable descriptions.\n\n<MODEL>\nproposed_perc = theta * 50 + (1 - theta) * (token_opp / (token_self + token_opp) * 100)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"proposed_perc\": {\n      \"description\": \"The percentage of the total earnings that is offered to the opponent by the proposer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent, indicating the opponent's contribution\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant, indicating the participant\u2019s contribution\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"theta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weighting parameter balancing an intrinsic equal split (50%) versus fairness share (derived from token counts), reflecting an equal-split bias\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>proposed_perc</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA model where the proposed percentage to the opponent is computed as a weighted average between an equal split (50%) and the fairness share determined by the opponent's token contribution.

  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. The key psychological mechanisms include fairness evaluation and an intrinsic bias toward equal splits. In the proposer role, participants may adjust the fair share they offer, which according to token counts is computed as the opponent\u2019s tokens divided by the total tokens. However, they might \u201canchor\u201d toward an equal (50%) offer independent of the tokens.\n2. These mechanisms interact in that the final proposal is a weighted combination of the fairness-perceived share (based on tokens) and the equal split benchmark.\n3. A suitable mathematical form is a weighted average between the fair share (derived as token_opp/(token_self + token_opp)) and an equal split (50%). The weights are determined by a single parameter.\n4. The only learnable parameter, theta, (with bounds 0 to 1) modulates between relying on fairness (when theta is 0) versus an equality bias (when theta is 1).\n5. The model variables: token_opp and token_self come from the data; the fairness share is token_opp/(token_self + token_opp)*100, and the final predicted proposed percentage offered to the opponent is: theta multiplied by 50 plus (1 \u2013 theta) multiplied by the fairness share.\n\nBelow is the formal model followed by variable descriptions.\n\n<MODEL>\nproposed_perc = theta * 50 + (1 - theta) * (token_opp / (token_self + token_opp) * 100)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"proposed_perc\": {\n      \"description\": \"The percentage of the total earnings that is offered to the opponent by the proposer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent, indicating the opponent's contribution\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant, indicating the participant\u2019s contribution\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"theta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weighting parameter balancing an intrinsic equal split (50%) versus fairness share (derived from token counts), reflecting an equal-split bias\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>proposed_perc</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA model where the proposed percentage to the opponent is computed as a weighted average between an equal split (50%) and the fairness share determined by the opponent's token contribution.

    "Specification: proposed_perc = theta * 50 + (1 - theta) * (token_opp / (token_self + token_opp) * 100)\nSummary: A model where the proposed percentage to the opponent is computed as a weighted average between an equal split (50%) and the fairness share determined by the opponent's token contribution. The single learnable parameter, theta (bounded between 0 and 1), governs the balance between these two considerations.\nTarget Variable: proposed_perc\nPrediction Type: numerical_variable_estimation"
