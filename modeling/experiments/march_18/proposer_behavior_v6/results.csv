1,,,,proposed_perc = theta * 50 + (1 - theta) * (token_opp / (token_self + token_opp) * 100),"A model where the proposed percentage to the opponent is computed as a weighted average between an equal split (50%) and the fairness share determined by the opponent's token contribution. The single learnable parameter, theta (bounded between 0 and 1), governs the balance between these two considerations.",v6
