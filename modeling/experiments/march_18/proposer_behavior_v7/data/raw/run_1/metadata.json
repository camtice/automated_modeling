      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Key psychological mechanisms:\n\u2003 Participants adjust their proposals based on their perceived contribution compared to their opponent. When the opponent\u2019s contribution is higher (i.e., token_opp > token_self), participants tend to be more generous by proposing a higher percentage (i.e., higher proposed_perc) for the opponent. Conversely, when their own contribution is higher, they tend to be less generous.\n2. Mechanism interactions:\n\u2003 A fairness norm is assumed whereby an equal split corresponds to a 50% offer to the opponent. Deviations from this norm depend on the difference in token counts (token_opp \u2013 token_self), scaled by the sum (token_opp + token_self) to factor in relative contributions. A sensitivity parameter modulates the degree to which this perceived fairness imbalance affects the proposal.\n3. Mathematical form:\n\u2003 The proposal is modeled as a baseline of 50 plus an adjustment term that captures the normalized difference in token contributions, scaled by a learnable parameter (\u03b2). This ensures that when contributions are equal the proposal is 50%, and deviations are proportional to the fairness imbalance.\n4. Parameter calibration:\n\u2003 Only one learnable parameter \u03b2 (beta) is introduced. It governs sensitivity to differences in token contributions. Finite bounds are specified for \u03b2.\n5. Mapping to behavior:\n\u2003 The observable \"proposed_perc\" is predicted from token_opp and token_self via the formula:\n\u2003\u2003predicted_proposed_perc = 50 + \u03b2 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 ((token_opp \u2013 token_self) / (token_opp + token_self))\n\u2003 This formula utilizes all variables within the equation and meets the constraint of a single learnable parameter.\n\nThe final model specification is as follows:\n\n<MODEL>\npredicted_proposed_perc = 50 + beta * 50 * ((token_opp - token_self)/(token_opp + token_self))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"predicted_proposed_perc\": {\n      \"description\": \"Predicted percentage offered to the opponent by the proposer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1000,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1000,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fairness sensitivity parameter determining the weight of the normalized token difference on the proposal\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>proposed_perc</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA fairness-based proposal model where a fixed 50% baseline is adjusted by the normalized token difference between the opponent and the participant.

  "target_variable": "proposed_perc",
  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Key psychological mechanisms:\n\u2003 Participants adjust their proposals based on their perceived contribution compared to their opponent. When the opponent\u2019s contribution is higher (i.e., token_opp > token_self), participants tend to be more generous by proposing a higher percentage (i.e., higher proposed_perc) for the opponent. Conversely, when their own contribution is higher, they tend to be less generous.\n2. Mechanism interactions:\n\u2003 A fairness norm is assumed whereby an equal split corresponds to a 50% offer to the opponent. Deviations from this norm depend on the difference in token counts (token_opp \u2013 token_self), scaled by the sum (token_opp + token_self) to factor in relative contributions. A sensitivity parameter modulates the degree to which this perceived fairness imbalance affects the proposal.\n3. Mathematical form:\n\u2003 The proposal is modeled as a baseline of 50 plus an adjustment term that captures the normalized difference in token contributions, scaled by a learnable parameter (\u03b2). This ensures that when contributions are equal the proposal is 50%, and deviations are proportional to the fairness imbalance.\n4. Parameter calibration:\n\u2003 Only one learnable parameter \u03b2 (beta) is introduced. It governs sensitivity to differences in token contributions. Finite bounds are specified for \u03b2.\n5. Mapping to behavior:\n\u2003 The observable \"proposed_perc\" is predicted from token_opp and token_self via the formula:\n\u2003\u2003predicted_proposed_perc = 50 + \u03b2 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 ((token_opp \u2013 token_self) / (token_opp + token_self))\n\u2003 This formula utilizes all variables within the equation and meets the constraint of a single learnable parameter.\n\nThe final model specification is as follows:\n\n<MODEL>\npredicted_proposed_perc = 50 + beta * 50 * ((token_opp - token_self)/(token_opp + token_self))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"predicted_proposed_perc\": {\n      \"description\": \"Predicted percentage offered to the opponent by the proposer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1000,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1000,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fairness sensitivity parameter determining the weight of the normalized token difference on the proposal\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>proposed_perc</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA fairness-based proposal model where a fixed 50% baseline is adjusted by the normalized token difference between the opponent and the participant.
