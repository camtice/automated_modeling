1,,,,predicted_proposed_perc = 50 + beta * 50 * ((token_opp - token_self)/(token_opp + token_self)),"A fairness-based proposal model where a fixed 50% baseline is adjusted by the normalized token difference between the opponent and the participant. The single free parameter beta scales this difference, allowing the model to capture individual sensitivity to fairness in the division of the combined earnings.",v7
2,,,,proposed_perc = 50 + gamma * 50 * ((token_opp - token_self) / (token_opp + token_self)),"A simple fairness-based model predicting the proposed percentage share to the opponent. The model linearly interpolates between a default equal split (50%) and the fairness ratio derived from the token contributions, with a single learnable parameter (gamma) determining the weight given to the observed token difference.",v7
3,,,,predicted_proposed_perc = 100/(1+exp(-beta_param*log(token_opp/token_self))),"A logistic fairness model where the proposed percentage to the opponent is determined by the log-ratio of opponent and participant tokens. The sole learnable parameter (beta_param) modulates sensitivity to the token imbalance, ensuring predictions remain within the 0â€“100% range.",v7
