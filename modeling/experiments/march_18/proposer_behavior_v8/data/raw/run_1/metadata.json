      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Psychological mechanisms: As a proposer, a participant is likely to adjust fairness expectations based on their own and the opponent\u2019s contributions, represented by token_self and token_opp. If contributions are equal, a fair split is expected (50% share to the opponent). Deviations in relative contribution induce a proportional adjustment.\n2. Interaction of mechanisms: The relative difference between the opponent\u2019s tokens and one\u2019s own tokens can be used to scale the deviation from an equitable split. A sensitivity to fairness differences (a single free parameter) modulates the extent to which this normalized difference influences the proposed percentage.\n3. Mathematical form: A simple linear formulation is appropriate. Begin with a baseline of 50 (representing an equal split) and add a term proportional to the normalized difference (token_opp \u2013 token_self)/(token_opp + token_self), scaled by a learned sensitivity parameter.\n4. Learnable parameter: Let lambda_param be the fairness sensitivity parameter. It is the only learnable parameter in the model and determines how much weight the fairness discrepancy has. We set generous finite bounds (e.g., 0 \u2264 lambda_param \u2264 10) to ensure flexibility.\n5. Mapping to observable behavior: The observable outcome (proposed_perc) is directly predicted by the model. The token values are observed data, and the learnable parameter modulates the effect of the relative token disparity on the percentage proposed to the opponent.\n\n<MODEL>\nproposed_perc = 50 + 50 * lambda_param * ((token_opp - token_self) / (token_opp + token_self))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"proposed_perc\": {\n      \"description\": \"The proposed percentage of the pot allocated to the opponent, expressed in percent.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"lambda_param\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fairness sensitivity parameter controlling the influence of token disparity on the proposed percentage.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>proposed_perc</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA linear fairness model predicting the percentage a proposer offers to the opponent based on the normalized difference between opponent and self tokens.

  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Psychological mechanisms: As a proposer, a participant is likely to adjust fairness expectations based on their own and the opponent\u2019s contributions, represented by token_self and token_opp. If contributions are equal, a fair split is expected (50% share to the opponent). Deviations in relative contribution induce a proportional adjustment.\n2. Interaction of mechanisms: The relative difference between the opponent\u2019s tokens and one\u2019s own tokens can be used to scale the deviation from an equitable split. A sensitivity to fairness differences (a single free parameter) modulates the extent to which this normalized difference influences the proposed percentage.\n3. Mathematical form: A simple linear formulation is appropriate. Begin with a baseline of 50 (representing an equal split) and add a term proportional to the normalized difference (token_opp \u2013 token_self)/(token_opp + token_self), scaled by a learned sensitivity parameter.\n4. Learnable parameter: Let lambda_param be the fairness sensitivity parameter. It is the only learnable parameter in the model and determines how much weight the fairness discrepancy has. We set generous finite bounds (e.g., 0 \u2264 lambda_param \u2264 10) to ensure flexibility.\n5. Mapping to observable behavior: The observable outcome (proposed_perc) is directly predicted by the model. The token values are observed data, and the learnable parameter modulates the effect of the relative token disparity on the percentage proposed to the opponent.\n\n<MODEL>\nproposed_perc = 50 + 50 * lambda_param * ((token_opp - token_self) / (token_opp + token_self))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"proposed_perc\": {\n      \"description\": \"The proposed percentage of the pot allocated to the opponent, expressed in percent.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"lambda_param\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fairness sensitivity parameter controlling the influence of token disparity on the proposed percentage.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>proposed_perc</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA linear fairness model predicting the percentage a proposer offers to the opponent based on the normalized difference between opponent and self tokens.
