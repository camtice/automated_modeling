1,,,,"U = beta0 + beta1 * (split_self - (token_self/(token_self+token_opp))*combined_earning)
P_accept = 1/(1+exp(-U))
accept ~ Bernoulli(P_accept)",A fairness-based utility model where the acceptance decision is governed by the deviation of the offered share from a fairness benchmark computed from the participant’s and opponent’s token counts multiplied by the total earning. The model uses two learnable parameters – an intercept (beta0) and a fairness sensitivity (beta1) – which are passed through a logistic function to yield the probability of acceptance.,v0
2,,,,P(accept=1) = 1/(1+exp(-(beta0 + beta1*(split_self - combined_earning*(token_self/(token_self+token_opp)))))),"A logistic choice model where responders’ acceptance decisions are driven by the deviation of the proposed share from the fair share, computed from token contributions and combined earnings. The model includes a baseline bias (beta0) and a fairness sensitivity parameter (beta1) that scales the deviation, and converts the resulting utility into an acceptance probability.",v0
