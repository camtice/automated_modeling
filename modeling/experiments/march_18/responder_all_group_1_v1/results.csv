1,,,,U_accept = beta0 + beta1 * (split_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning),A fairness-based decision model where the utility of accepting an offer is determined by a baseline bias and a weighted deviation between the offered amount and an expected fair share based on token contributions. The model uses a logistic transformation of the computed utility to predict binary acceptance.,v1
2,,,,p_accept = 1/(1 + exp(-(b + theta*(split_self - combined_earning*(token_self/(token_self + token_opp))))),The model computes a decision utility for accepting an offer by combining a baseline bias with a fairness discrepancy measure (the difference between the proposed personal share and the fair share based on tokens). This utility is then transformed through a logistic function to yield the probability of acceptance. Two learnable parameters (b and theta) allow the model to capture individual differences while limiting parameter covariance.,v1
