proposed_perc = 100 * p",A parsimonious binary choice model for proposer behavior in which the fairness differential—the normalized difference between opponent and participant token counts—shifts a baseline intercept. The resulting latent utility is passed through a logistic function and scaled to yield a proposed percentage offer between 0 and 100.,v5,0.7411719160163526,-0.012792798630004718
