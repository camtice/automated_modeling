accept_pred = 1/(1+exp(-U))",A logistic fairness model where responders compare the offered split to the fair share (based on token contribution). The latent utility is a linear function of the fairness discrepancy with two simple learnable parameters (an intercept and a sensitivity term). A sigmoid transformation converts the latent utility into a continuous prediction of acceptance.,v1,0.8228125085980252,0.8722281559598056
