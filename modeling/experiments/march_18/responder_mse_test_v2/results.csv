The fairness expectation is computed based on the participant’s token contribution relative to the total tokens, scaled by a learnable fairness weight parameter. A baseline intercept and sensitivity parameter govern the mapping from fairness deviation to a probability outcome.",v2,0.6228412376492732,0.45619060110896953,0.7886141465263646

Acceptance is predicted by comparing the offered share (split_self) to a learned fair share (f times combined_earning) and adjusted by the relative token contributions (token_self - token_opp). The model uses four learnable parameters (a, beta, gamma, and f) with finite bounds to balance prediction accuracy and parameter identifiability.",v2,,,
