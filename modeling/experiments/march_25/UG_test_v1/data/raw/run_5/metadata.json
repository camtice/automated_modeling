  "task_description": "Participants played 320 games (in four blocks of 80 games) of our Horizon task (see Figure\n1A). Each game lasted either five or 10 trials and the two game lengths were interleaved and\ncounter-balanced such that there were 160 games of each length.\nIn each game, participants made repeated decisions between two options. Each option paid\nout between 1 and 100 points that was sampled (rounded to the nearest integer) from a\nGaussian distribution with a fixed standard deviation of 8 points. The generative means of\nthe underlying Gaussians were different for the two options and remained stable within a\ngame. In each game, the mean of one option was set to either 40 or 60 points and the mean\nof the other was set relative to the mean of the first, such that the difference between the two\nwas sampled from 4, 8, 12, 20, and 30. Both the identity and the difference in means were\ncounterbalanced over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were instructed in the task with the use of a set of illustrated onscreen\ninstructions. These explicitly conveyed that the means of the two options were constant over\na game and that the variability in the options was constant over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were told to maximize the points they earned and that one option was always\nbetter on average. The full text of the instructions is provided in the Supplementary Material.\nChoice and outcome history in each game remained onscreen inside each of the slot\nmachines (Figure 1A). After a particular option was played, the reward on that trial was\nadded to the slot machine, whereas the corresponding space for the unplayed option was\nfilled with an \u201cXX.\u201d\nThe first four trials of each game were forced-choice trials, in which only one of the options\n(cued by a green square inside the next available space) was available for participants to\nchoose. We used these forced-choice trials to manipulate the information participants had\nabout the two options from experience (Hertwig, Barron, Weber, & Erev, 2004) before their\nfirst free choice, while maintaining their active engagement in the task. The four forcedchoice trials set up two information conditions: \u201cunequal information\u201d (or [1 3]), in which\none option was forced to be played once and the other three times, and \u201cequal information\u201d\n(or [2 2]), in which each option was forced to be played twice.\nCrucially, this manipulation ensured that participants were exposed to a specified amount of\ninformation about each option, regardless of how rewarding it was. Furthermore, the relative\namount of information provided about each option was independent of the relative difference\nin their means. Thus on the first free choice (the fifth trial in each game), the difference in\nthe number of times each option had been sampled (and hence the difference in available\ninformation) had no effect on the difference in mean payout of that option (repeatedmeasures ANOVA,\nF(2, 89) = 0.09,\np = .91) thus removing the reward\u2013information\nconfound on this trial.\nAfter the forced-choice trials, participants made either one or six free choices (Figure 1B).\nAt the beginning of each game, the number of upcoming free-choice trials (i.e., the horizon)\n\n\nBelow is the description of each variable in the dataset, which will be followed by information about the data type of the variable:\n\nparticipant = [Unique identifier for each human subject in the experiment]\ntask = [Identifier for the specific game/round the participant is playing]\ntrial = [Sequential number indicating which decision point this is within a game]\nchoice = [The option (0 or 1) that the participant selected on this trial]\nreward = [The number of points (1-100) received after making a choice]\nRT = [Reaction time measuring how long it took the participant to make their decision]\nexpected_reward0 = [The observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous forced/free plays]\nexpected_reward1 = [The observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous forced/free plays]\nforced_choice = [Boolean indicator of whether this was a forced-choice trial (1) or free-choice trial (0)]\nhorizon = [The number of free choices available in the current game (either 1 or 6)]\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- ID (int64)\n- group (object)\n- trial_number (int64)\n- trial_type (int64)\n- trial_role (int64)\n- token_opp (int64)\n- token_self (int64)\n- combined_earning (int64)\n- split_opp (float64)\n- split_self (float64)\n- splitperc_opp (int64)\n- splitperc_self (int64)\n- accept (float64)\n- accepted_amount (float64)\n- accepted_perc (float64)\n- proposed_perc (float64)\n- proposed_amount (float64)\n\nNumber of observations: 3276\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- ID (int64)\n- group (object)\n- trial_number (int64)\n- trial_type (int64)\n- trial_role (int64)\n- token_opp (int64)\n- token_self (int64)\n- combined_earning (int64)\n- split_opp (float64)\n- split_self (float64)\n- splitperc_opp (int64)\n- splitperc_self (int64)\n- accept (float64)\n- accepted_amount (float64)\n- accepted_perc (float64)\n- proposed_perc (float64)\n- proposed_amount (float64)\n\nNumber of observations: 3276",

      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Key mechanisms: Responder evaluation based on fairness. In this task, responders decide to accept or reject proposals primarily according to the fairness of the proposed split. A key psychological mechanism is how far the proposed percentage deviates from what is perceived as fair (here taken as 50%). This deviation is weighted by an individual\u2019s sensitivity to fairness and added to a baseline bias to produce a subjective utility.\n2. Mechanism interaction: The proposal is first compared with a reference value (50%). A weighted difference quantifies how favorable or unfavorable the offer is relative to fairness. An intercept (baseline bias) captures any predisposition toward acceptance or rejection irrespective of the offer.\n3. Mathematical form: A simple linear equation is used to compute the utility: U = baseline + sensitivity*(proposed_perc \u2013 50). Since utility is then mapped to acceptance probability via a logistic transformation, U < 0 will correspond to a lower than 50% acceptance chance.\n4. Parameters needed: Two learnable parameters are needed:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 b0 (baseline) \u2013 models an inherent tendency to accept or reject proposals.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 b1 (offer_sensitivity) \u2013 scales the influence of how much the offered percentage deviates from 50%.\n   Finite, generous bounds are provided to avoid parameter covariance.\n5.

  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Key mechanisms: Responder evaluation based on fairness. In this task, responders decide to accept or reject proposals primarily according to the fairness of the proposed split. A key psychological mechanism is how far the proposed percentage deviates from what is perceived as fair (here taken as 50%). This deviation is weighted by an individual\u2019s sensitivity to fairness and added to a baseline bias to produce a subjective utility.\n2. Mechanism interaction: The proposal is first compared with a reference value (50%). A weighted difference quantifies how favorable or unfavorable the offer is relative to fairness. An intercept (baseline bias) captures any predisposition toward acceptance or rejection irrespective of the offer.\n3. Mathematical form: A simple linear equation is used to compute the utility: U = baseline + sensitivity*(proposed_perc \u2013 50). Since utility is then mapped to acceptance probability via a logistic transformation, U < 0 will correspond to a lower than 50% acceptance chance.\n4. Parameters needed: Two learnable parameters are needed:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 b0 (baseline) \u2013 models an inherent tendency to accept or reject proposals.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 b1 (offer_sensitivity) \u2013 scales the influence of how much the offered percentage deviates from 50%.\n   Finite, generous bounds are provided to avoid parameter covariance.\n5. Mapping to observable behavior: The model uses the offered percentage from the dataset (proposed_perc) as the key input, computes utility, and then, via a logistic function (applied in subsequent analysis), predicts the binary behavior (accept/reject) captured by the target variable \u201caccept\u201d.\n\nBelow is the formal specification:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = b0 + b1*(proposed_perc - 50)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposal\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"b0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Baseline bias parameter representing intrinsic tendency to accept or reject\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -100,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"b1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Offer sensitivity parameter scaling the deviation of the proposed percentage from fairness (50%)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"proposed_perc\": {\n      \"description\": \"Percentage of tokens proposed to be allocated to the responder\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>accept</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA two-parameter linear utility model where utility is computed as a baseline bias plus a sensitivity-weighted deviation of the proposed percentage from a fairness benchmark (50%).
