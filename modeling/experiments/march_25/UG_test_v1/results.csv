1,,,,U = beta * (proposed_perc - tau),"A parsimonious fairness-based model in which the utility of accepting an offer is determined by how much the proposed percentage for the responder deviates from a fairness threshold. The model computes utility as a scaled difference between the observed proposed percentage (from the offer) and a free fairness threshold. When the utility is below 0 the probability of acceptance is less than 50% (via logistic transformation). The two learnable parameters are a sensitivity parameter (beta) and the fairness threshold (tau), both of which have generous but finite bounds.",v1
2,,,,U = beta0 + theta * (splitperc_self - 50),A simple linear utility model for responder behavior where the computed utility is a function of a baseline bias and the deviation of the offered percentage from a fair 50% share. This utility is later passed through a logistic function to predict the binary acceptance response.,v1
3,,,,U = beta0 + beta_offer*(proposed_perc - 50),A linear utility model for responder decisions that combines a baseline acceptance tendency with sensitivity to deviations from a 50% fair offer. The computed utility is later transformed into a choice probability via a logistic function.,v1
4,,,,U = beta0 + beta_offer * (proposed_perc - 50),"A simple linear utility model for responder behavior in which the utility is computed as a baseline bias plus a sensitivity to how much the proposerâ€™s offer (proposed_perc) deviates from a fair split (50%). The utility is then passed through a logistic function (outside the model) to predict acceptance. This parsimonious model uses two learnable parameters with finite, generous bounds.",v1
5,,,,U = b0 + b1*(proposed_perc - 50),A two-parameter linear utility model where utility is computed as a baseline bias plus a sensitivity-weighted deviation of the proposed percentage from a fairness benchmark (50%). This utility is then used to predict the binary accept/reject decision via a logistic function.,v1
