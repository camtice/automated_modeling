1,,,,P_accept = 1/(1+exp(-beta*(proposed_perc - theta))),A two-parameter logistic utility model in which the utility of accepting is given by beta scaled difference between the offered percentage and an internal fairness threshold theta. The probability of acceptance is determined by a logistic transform of this utility.,v2
