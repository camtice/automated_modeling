1,160.05381334899843,,,U = bias + lambda_f * ( split_self - (combined_earning * token_self / (token_self + token_opp) ) ),A logistic choice model where the utility for accepting an offer is computed by comparing the proposed share to the fairness norm (determined by the participant’s relative token count) and adding a baseline bias. The model uses two learnable parameters—bias and fairness sensitivity—to predict acceptance behavior.,v3,0.7851445027739039,0.8442563886568302
