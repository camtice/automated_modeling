accept ~ Bernoulli(p)",A parsimonious model for responder behavior where the utility of accepting a proposal is computed as a linear combination of a baseline bias and the sensitivity-weighted fairness discrepancy between the offered and the fair share (calculated from token contributions and combined earnings).

U = beta0 + beta_fair*(split_self - (token_self/(token_self+token_opp))*combined_earning)",A logistic utility model where the latent utility is the sum of a baseline intercept and a fairness-sensitive component. The fairness component is computed as the deviation of the offered share from the fair share derived from token contributions and combined earnings. This utility is mapped into the probability of accepting the proposal.,v4,,,,0.8390163124172078,0.8136290145874558,,,,,

P_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(-U))",A logistic choice model for responders that computes utility as a sum of a baseline bias and a fairness deviation weighted by sensitivity. The fairness deviation is defined as the difference between the offered share and the fair share determined by token contributions. This utility is then converted to a probability using a logistic transformation to predict accept/reject decisions.,v4,,,,,,,,0.8379115165110733,0.7500964900879042,

P_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(-U))",A model of responder decisions where the latent utility is derived from the deviation between the proposed percentage share and the fairness norm (determined by the proportional token count). The model uses a logistic transformation to map utility to the probability of acceptance and includes two learnable parameters (an intercept beta0 and a fairness sensitivity beta1) with finite bounds.,v4,,,,0.5586111403839994,,,,,,0.7008841018280173

The utility is computed as a weighted unfairness (difference between offered and fair shares) plus a baseline intercept, and acceptance probability is given by a logistic function applied to this utility.",v4,0.5816207408958685,0.3378603843403945,0.14702547655643666,,,,,,,
