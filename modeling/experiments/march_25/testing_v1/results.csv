p = 1/(1+exp(-U))",A fairness-based decision model in which the responder compares the offered share to a normatively fair share based on token contributions and combined earnings. The model features two learnable parameters—a baseline bias (beta0) and fairness sensitivity (beta_fair)—to compute a utility that is passed through a logistic function to predict the binary acceptance decision.,v1,0.15542779683435193,0.19018244946646984,,
2,52.18350354108439,,,P(accept=1) = 1/(1+exp(- (alpha + beta*(splitperc_self - 100*(token_self/(token_self+token_opp)) )))),A binary choice model for responder behavior in which the probability of accepting a proposal is determined by the discrepancy between the offered percentage and a fair share percentage based on token contributions. The model uses a logistic function driven by two learnable parameters: an intercept and a fairness sensitivity. This simple specification ensures low covariance among the parameters while capturing key fairness considerations.,v1,,,0.2829860261843158,0.3250551995248372
