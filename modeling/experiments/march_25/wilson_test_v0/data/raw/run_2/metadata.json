  "task_description": "Participants played 320 games (in four blocks of 80 games) of our Horizon task (see Figure\n1A). Each game lasted either five or 10 trials and the two game lengths were interleaved and\ncounter-balanced such that there were 160 games of each length.\nIn each game, participants made repeated decisions between two options. Each option paid\nout between 1 and 100 points that was sampled (rounded to the nearest integer) from a\nGaussian distribution with a fixed standard deviation of 8 points. The generative means of\nthe underlying Gaussians were different for the two options and remained stable within a\ngame. In each game, the mean of one option was set to either 40 or 60 points and the mean\nof the other was set relative to the mean of the first, such that the difference between the two\nwas sampled from 4, 8, 12, 20, and 30. Both the identity and the difference in means were\ncounterbalanced over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were instructed in the task with the use of a set of illustrated onscreen\ninstructions. These explicitly conveyed that the means of the two options were constant over\na game and that the variability in the options was constant over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were told to maximize the points they earned and that one option was always\nbetter on average. The full text of the instructions is provided in the Supplementary Material.\nChoice and outcome history in each game remained onscreen inside each of the slot\nmachines (Figure 1A). After a particular option was played, the reward on that trial was\nadded to the slot machine, whereas the corresponding space for the unplayed option was\nfilled with an \u201cXX.\u201d\nThe first four trials of each game were forced-choice trials, in which only one of the options\n(cued by a green square inside the next available space) was available for participants to\nchoose. We used these forced-choice trials to manipulate the information participants had\nabout the two options from experience (Hertwig, Barron, Weber, & Erev, 2004) before their\nfirst free choice, while maintaining their active engagement in the task. The four forcedchoice trials set up two information conditions: \u201cunequal information\u201d (or [1 3]), in which\none option was forced to be played once and the other three times, and \u201cequal information\u201d\n(or [2 2]), in which each option was forced to be played twice.\nCrucially, this manipulation ensured that participants were exposed to a specified amount of\ninformation about each option, regardless of how rewarding it was. Furthermore, the relative\namount of information provided about each option was independent of the relative difference\nin their means. Thus on the first free choice (the fifth trial in each game), the difference in\nthe number of times each option had been sampled (and hence the difference in available\ninformation) had no effect on the difference in mean payout of that option (repeatedmeasures ANOVA,\nF(2, 89) = 0.09,\np = .91) thus removing the reward\u2013information\nconfound on this trial.\nAfter the forced-choice trials, participants made either one or six free choices (Figure 1B).\nAt the beginning of each game, the number of upcoming free-choice trials (i.e., the horizon)\n\n\nBelow is the description of each variable in the dataset, which will be followed by information about the data type of the variable:\n\nparticipant = [Unique identifier for each human subject in the experiment]\ntask = [Identifier for the specific game/round the participant is playing]\ntrial = [Sequential number indicating which decision point this is within a game]\nchoice = [The option (0 or 1) that the participant selected on this trial]\nreward = [The number of points (1-100) received after making a choice]\nRT = [Reaction time measuring how long it took the participant to make their decision]\nexpected_reward0 = [The observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous forced/free plays]\nexpected_reward1 = [The observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous forced/free plays]\nforced_choice = [Boolean indicator of whether this was a forced-choice trial (1) or free-choice trial (0)]\nhorizon = [The number of free choices available in the current game (either 1 or 6)]\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- Unnamed: 0 (int64)\n- ID (int64)\n- task (int64)\n- trial (int64)\n- choice (int64)\n- reward (float64)\n- RT (float64)\n- expected_reward0 (int64)\n- expected_reward1 (int64)\n- forced_choice (bool)\n- horizon (int64)\n\nNumber of observations: 144000\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- Unnamed: 0 (int64)\n- ID (int64)\n- task (int64)\n- trial (int64)\n- choice (int64)\n- reward (float64)\n- RT (float64)\n- expected_reward0 (int64)\n- expected_reward1 (int64)\n- forced_choice (bool)\n- horizon (int64)\n\nNumber of observations: 144000",

      "output": "Below is my step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning and final model specification.\n\nStep\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n1. Key psychological mechanisms include the integration of learned reward estimates (exploitation) and an exploration bonus that favors options with less information (i.e. more uncertainty). In our task participants learn expected rewards from previous outcomes (available as expected_reward0 and expected_reward1) and also are exposed to different sampling frequencies (via the forced\u2010choice trials) that affect uncertainty about each option.\n2. These mechanisms interact by combining the difference in the expected rewards with an \u201cinformation bonus\u201d determined by the relative number of times each option has been sampled. In addition, a bias term can capture any unspecific preference.\n3. A simple way to mathematically capture this is to assign, for each option i, a utility U_i composed of its current estimated reward (expected_reward_i) plus a bonus that is inversely related to the square root of the number of times option i has been sampled (n_i). The exploration bonus is further modulated by the horizon (the number of free choices available) since exploration is more beneficial when more choices are in the future.\n4. The model thus needs three learnable parameters: an inverse temperature (beta) that scales the overall sensitivity to utility differences, an exploration bonus weight (gamma), and an intercept bias (bias). To avoid high covariance between parameters we use a simple additive model with only three free parameters and restrict their numerical bounds to generous but finite ranges.\n5. The observable behavior is the choice the participant makes on free-choice trials. We map the utilities to choice probability with a logistic function of the difference in utilities between the two options.\n\nThe formal mathematical model uses the available expected rewards, a calculated count of previous samples (n0 and n1) from the game history (which can be derived using the forced_choice indicator and trial information), and the provided horizon variable.\n\nBelow is the formal specification.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n<MODEL>\np(choice=1) = 1/(1 + exp(- beta * ( (expected_reward1 - expected_reward0) + gamma * (horizon - 1) * (1/sqrt(n1) - 1/sqrt(n0)) + bias ) ))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"expected_reward0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous forced/free plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous forced/free plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"horizon\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of free choices available in the current game (1 or 6)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"n0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of times option 0 has been sampled up to the current trial (forced and past free choices)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 320,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"n1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of times option 1 has been sampled up to the current trial (forced and past free choices)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 320,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Inverse temperature parameter controlling sensitivity to utility difference\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.001,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"gamma\": {\n      \"description\": \"Exploration bonus weight parameter modulating the influence of uncertainty differences\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"bias\": {\n      \"description\": \"Intercept bias capturing any overall tendency toward an option\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>choice</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA binary choice model in which the utility of each option is the sum of its observed mean reward and an exploration bonus that is inversely proportional to the square root of its sampling count.

  "full_reasoning": "Below is my step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning and final model specification.\n\nStep\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n1. Key psychological mechanisms include the integration of learned reward estimates (exploitation) and an exploration bonus that favors options with less information (i.e. more uncertainty). In our task participants learn expected rewards from previous outcomes (available as expected_reward0 and expected_reward1) and also are exposed to different sampling frequencies (via the forced\u2010choice trials) that affect uncertainty about each option.\n2. These mechanisms interact by combining the difference in the expected rewards with an \u201cinformation bonus\u201d determined by the relative number of times each option has been sampled. In addition, a bias term can capture any unspecific preference.\n3. A simple way to mathematically capture this is to assign, for each option i, a utility U_i composed of its current estimated reward (expected_reward_i) plus a bonus that is inversely related to the square root of the number of times option i has been sampled (n_i). The exploration bonus is further modulated by the horizon (the number of free choices available) since exploration is more beneficial when more choices are in the future.\n4. The model thus needs three learnable parameters: an inverse temperature (beta) that scales the overall sensitivity to utility differences, an exploration bonus weight (gamma), and an intercept bias (bias). To avoid high covariance between parameters we use a simple additive model with only three free parameters and restrict their numerical bounds to generous but finite ranges.\n5. The observable behavior is the choice the participant makes on free-choice trials. We map the utilities to choice probability with a logistic function of the difference in utilities between the two options.\n\nThe formal mathematical model uses the available expected rewards, a calculated count of previous samples (n0 and n1) from the game history (which can be derived using the forced_choice indicator and trial information), and the provided horizon variable.\n\nBelow is the formal specification.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n<MODEL>\np(choice=1) = 1/(1 + exp(- beta * ( (expected_reward1 - expected_reward0) + gamma * (horizon - 1) * (1/sqrt(n1) - 1/sqrt(n0)) + bias ) ))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"expected_reward0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous forced/free plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous forced/free plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"horizon\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of free choices available in the current game (1 or 6)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"n0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of times option 0 has been sampled up to the current trial (forced and past free choices)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 320,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"n1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of times option 1 has been sampled up to the current trial (forced and past free choices)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 320,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Inverse temperature parameter controlling sensitivity to utility difference\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.001,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"gamma\": {\n      \"description\": \"Exploration bonus weight parameter modulating the influence of uncertainty differences\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"bias\": {\n      \"description\": \"Intercept bias capturing any overall tendency toward an option\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>choice</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA binary choice model in which the utility of each option is the sum of its observed mean reward and an exploration bonus that is inversely proportional to the square root of its sampling count.

The bonus is scaled by the horizon (with no bonus when the horizon is 1) and weighted by a learnable exploration parameter gamma. The decision is made via a logistic function applying an inverse temperature beta and an overall bias term.\nTarget Variable: choice\nPrediction Type: utility\nBIC: 3253.066033327937\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- beta: r = -0.025\n- gamma: r = 0.112\n- bias: r = 0.529"
