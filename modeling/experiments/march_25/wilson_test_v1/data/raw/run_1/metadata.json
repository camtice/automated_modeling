  "task_description": "Participants played 320 games (in four blocks of 80 games) of our Horizon task (see Figure\n1A). Each game lasted either five or 10 trials and the two game lengths were interleaved and\ncounter-balanced such that there were 160 games of each length.\nIn each game, participants made repeated decisions between two options. Each option paid\nout between 1 and 100 points that was sampled (rounded to the nearest integer) from a\nGaussian distribution with a fixed standard deviation of 8 points. The generative means of\nthe underlying Gaussians were different for the two options and remained stable within a\ngame. In each game, the mean of one option was set to either 40 or 60 points and the mean\nof the other was set relative to the mean of the first, such that the difference between the two\nwas sampled from 4, 8, 12, 20, and 30. Both the identity and the difference in means were\ncounterbalanced over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were instructed in the task with the use of a set of illustrated onscreen\ninstructions. These explicitly conveyed that the means of the two options were constant over\na game and that the variability in the options was constant over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were told to maximize the points they earned and that one option was always\nbetter on average. The full text of the instructions is provided in the Supplementary Material.\nChoice and outcome history in each game remained onscreen inside each of the slot\nmachines (Figure 1A). After a particular option was played, the reward on that trial was\nadded to the slot machine, whereas the corresponding space for the unplayed option was\nfilled with an \u201cXX.\u201d\nThe first four trials of each game were forced-choice trials, in which only one of the options\n(cued by a green square inside the next available space) was available for participants to\nchoose. We used these forced-choice trials to manipulate the information participants had\nabout the two options from experience (Hertwig, Barron, Weber, & Erev, 2004) before their\nfirst free choice, while maintaining their active engagement in the task. The four forcedchoice trials set up two information conditions: \u201cunequal information\u201d (or [1 3]), in which\none option was forced to be played once and the other three times, and \u201cequal information\u201d\n(or [2 2]), in which each option was forced to be played twice.\nCrucially, this manipulation ensured that participants were exposed to a specified amount of\ninformation about each option, regardless of how rewarding it was. Furthermore, the relative\namount of information provided about each option was independent of the relative difference\nin their means. Thus on the first free choice (the fifth trial in each game), the difference in\nthe number of times each option had been sampled (and hence the difference in available\ninformation) had no effect on the difference in mean payout of that option (repeatedmeasures ANOVA,\nF(2, 89) = 0.09,\np = .91) thus removing the reward\u2013information\nconfound on this trial.\nAfter the forced-choice trials, participants made either one or six free choices (Figure 1B).\nAt the beginning of each game, the number of upcoming free-choice trials (i.e., the horizon)\n\n\nBelow is the description of each variable in the dataset, which will be followed by information about the data type of the variable:\n\nparticipant = [Unique identifier for each human subject in the experiment]\ntask = [Identifier for the specific game/round the participant is playing]\ntrial = [Sequential number indicating which decision point this is within a game]\nchoice = [The option (0 or 1) that the participant selected on this trial]\nreward = [The number of points (1-100) received after making a choice]\nRT = [Reaction time measuring how long it took the participant to make their decision]\nexpected_reward0 = [The observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous forced/free plays]\nexpected_reward1 = [The observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous forced/free plays]\nforced_choice = [Boolean indicator of whether this was a forced-choice trial (1) or free-choice trial (0)]\nhorizon = [The number of free choices available in the current game (either 1 or 6)]\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- Unnamed: 0 (int64)\n- ID (int64)\n- task (int64)\n- trial (int64)\n- choice (int64)\n- reward (float64)\n- RT (float64)\n- expected_reward0 (int64)\n- expected_reward1 (int64)\n- forced_choice (bool)\n- horizon (int64)\n\nNumber of observations: 144000\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- Unnamed: 0 (int64)\n- ID (int64)\n- task (int64)\n- trial (int64)\n- choice (int64)\n- reward (float64)\n- RT (float64)\n- expected_reward0 (int64)\n- expected_reward1 (int64)\n- forced_choice (bool)\n- horizon (int64)\n\nNumber of observations: 144000",

      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Key psychological mechanisms:\n   \u2022 Participants base their decisions on estimates of the rewards from each option that they have accumulated from forced (and previous free) trials. These estimates drive exploitation.\n   \u2022 At the time of the first free-choice (and possibly later free-choices) participants weigh the observed (sampled) expected rewards from each option.\n   \u2022 The decision is made probabilistically (binary choice) based on the difference in these value estimates.\n   \u2022 Although the task design manipulates the amount of information (forced having provided different numbers of samples for the two options), on the first free-choice this manipulation does not confound with reward, so the model can use the difference of observed mean rewards directly.\n   \n2. How these mechanisms interact:\n   \u2022 The expected rewards (observed from prior sampling) directly influence the subjective utility of each option.\n   \u2022 The model combines the reward difference with a decision sensitivity parameter.\n   \u2022 A bias term is also included to capture any baseline preference independent of reward difference.\n   \n3. Mathematical form to capture these interactions:\n   \u2022 For each free-choice trial (forced_choice = FALSE) we define a decision variable as the difference of the expected rewards scaled by a sensitivity (exploitation) parameter.\n   \u2022 Adding a global bias (or baseline term) gives: decision variable = \u03b2 \u00b7 (expected_reward1 \u2212 expected_reward0) + \u03b1.\n   \u2022 This variable is then passed through a logistic function to obtain a probability (between 0 and 1) of choosing option 1.\n   \n4. Parameters needed to calibrate the model:\n   \u2022 \u03b2 (beta): Decision (reward) sensitivity parameter. It controls how strongly the difference in expected rewards influences the decision.

  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Key psychological mechanisms:\n   \u2022 Participants base their decisions on estimates of the rewards from each option that they have accumulated from forced (and previous free) trials. These estimates drive exploitation.\n   \u2022 At the time of the first free-choice (and possibly later free-choices) participants weigh the observed (sampled) expected rewards from each option.\n   \u2022 The decision is made probabilistically (binary choice) based on the difference in these value estimates.\n   \u2022 Although the task design manipulates the amount of information (forced having provided different numbers of samples for the two options), on the first free-choice this manipulation does not confound with reward, so the model can use the difference of observed mean rewards directly.\n   \n2. How these mechanisms interact:\n   \u2022 The expected rewards (observed from prior sampling) directly influence the subjective utility of each option.\n   \u2022 The model combines the reward difference with a decision sensitivity parameter.\n   \u2022 A bias term is also included to capture any baseline preference independent of reward difference.\n   \n3. Mathematical form to capture these interactions:\n   \u2022 For each free-choice trial (forced_choice = FALSE) we define a decision variable as the difference of the expected rewards scaled by a sensitivity (exploitation) parameter.\n   \u2022 Adding a global bias (or baseline term) gives: decision variable = \u03b2 \u00b7 (expected_reward1 \u2212 expected_reward0) + \u03b1.\n   \u2022 This variable is then passed through a logistic function to obtain a probability (between 0 and 1) of choosing option 1.\n   \n4. Parameters needed to calibrate the model:\n   \u2022 \u03b2 (beta): Decision (reward) sensitivity parameter. It controls how strongly the difference in expected rewards influences the decision. A larger value indicates more deterministic choices based on reward differences.\n   \u2022 \u03b1 (alpha): A choice bias or intercept term which captures any overall tendency toward one option regardless of the expected rewards.\n   \u2022 Finite numerical bounds are assigned: for example, \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 20] and \u03b1 \u2208 [\u221220, 20]. These bounds are generous.\n   \n5. How the model variables map to observable behavior:\n   \u2022 The outcomes \u201cexpected_reward0\u201d and \u201cexpected_reward1\u201d (computed from previous forced/free plays) serve as inputs.\n   \u2022 The model predicts the binary \u201cchoice\u201d variable (when forced_choice is FALSE) using the logistic function over the numerical input computed from these rewards.\n   \u2022 Reaction time and other variables are not needed for this simple utility model.\n\nBelow is the formal specification.\n\n<MODEL>\nP(choice=1) = 1/(1 + exp(- (beta * (expected_reward1 - expected_reward0) + alpha)))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Decision sensitivity parameter controlling the influence of the reward difference on choice\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"low\": 0,\n          \"high\": 20\n        }\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Choice bias parameter controlling an overall tendency towards one option\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -20,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"low\": -20,\n          \"high\": 20\n        }\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous forced/free plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous forced/free plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>choice</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA binary logistic choice model in which the decision variable is a linear function of the difference between the observed mean rewards of the two options, scaled by a reward sensitivity parameter and shifted by a bias term.
