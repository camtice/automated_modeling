  "task_description": "Participants played 320 games (in four blocks of 80 games) of our Horizon task (see Figure\n1A). Each game lasted either five or 10 trials and the two game lengths were interleaved and\ncounter-balanced such that there were 160 games of each length.\nIn each game, participants made repeated decisions between two options. Each option paid\nout between 1 and 100 points that was sampled (rounded to the nearest integer) from a\nGaussian distribution with a fixed standard deviation of 8 points. The generative means of\nthe underlying Gaussians were different for the two options and remained stable within a\ngame. In each game, the mean of one option was set to either 40 or 60 points and the mean\nof the other was set relative to the mean of the first, such that the difference between the two\nwas sampled from 4, 8, 12, 20, and 30. Both the identity and the difference in means were\ncounterbalanced over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were instructed in the task with the use of a set of illustrated onscreen\ninstructions. These explicitly conveyed that the means of the two options were constant over\na game and that the variability in the options was constant over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were told to maximize the points they earned and that one option was always\nbetter on average. The full text of the instructions is provided in the Supplementary Material.\nChoice and outcome history in each game remained onscreen inside each of the slot\nmachines (Figure 1A). After a particular option was played, the reward on that trial was\nadded to the slot machine, whereas the corresponding space for the unplayed option was\nfilled with an \u201cXX.\u201d\nThe first four trials of each game were forced-choice trials, in which only one of the options\n(cued by a green square inside the next available space) was available for participants to\nchoose. We used these forced-choice trials to manipulate the information participants had\nabout the two options from experience (Hertwig, Barron, Weber, & Erev, 2004) before their\nfirst free choice, while maintaining their active engagement in the task. The four forcedchoice trials set up two information conditions: \u201cunequal information\u201d (or [1 3]), in which\none option was forced to be played once and the other three times, and \u201cequal information\u201d\n(or [2 2]), in which each option was forced to be played twice.\nCrucially, this manipulation ensured that participants were exposed to a specified amount of\ninformation about each option, regardless of how rewarding it was.

      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Psychological mechanisms: Participants learn about each option\u2019s potential based on observed rewards during forced trials (via expected_reward0 and expected_reward1) and then use these estimates when making free choices. In addition, the horizon (number of free choices available: 1 vs. 6) acts as a contextual cue that promotes exploration when many future choices are available. Finally, a general response bias might be present.\n2. Interactions: The participant\u2019s decision in a free-choice trial is assumed to arise from a combination of the difference in estimated rewards across options (exploitation) and the influence of horizon (exploration bonus when horizon is high), along with an overall bias. The difference in expected rewards is weighted by a parameter that reflects sensitivity (or inverse temperature), while the horizon factor is included as a bonus when the horizon is long.\n3. Mathematical form: A logistic regression (softmax) formulation is used so that the computed utility difference is mapped onto the probability of choosing option 1. In our model, the utility difference is a linear combination of (a) the difference in expected rewards, (b) a horizon factor, and (c) an intercept bias.\n4. Required parameters: \n   \u2022 A reward sensitivity parameter, beta_reward, which scales the expected reward difference.\n   \u2022 A horizon effect parameter, beta_horizon, which scales how much an elevated number of free choices influences utility; the horizon variable is normalized to an indicator (0 for horizon=1 and 1 for horizon=6).\n   \u2022 An intercept bias parameter, bias.\n   Finite bounds are provided for each learnable parameter.\n5. Mapping to observable behavior: The model uses the observed expected_reward0, expected_reward1, and horizon from the dataset (only for free-choice trials where forced_choice == FALSE) to compute a utility difference. This utility then feeds a logistic function to yield the probability of choosing option 1, thereby predicting the 'choice' variable.\n\nBelow is the formal specification.\n\n<MODEL>\np = 1/(1+exp(-(beta_reward*(expected_reward1 - expected_reward0) + beta_horizon*((horizon-1)/5) + bias)))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"p\": {\n      \"description\": \"Probability of choosing option 1 on a free-choice trial\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta_reward\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to the difference in expected rewards between option 1 and option 0\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta_horizon\": {\n      \"description\": \"Scaling parameter for the horizon effect, applied to indicator variable (0 for horizon=1, 1 for horizon=6)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"bias\": {\n      \"description\": \"Intercept bias parameter reflecting overall tendency to choose option 1\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous plays in the game\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous plays in the game\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"horizon\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of free-choice trials available in the current game (1 or 6)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>choice</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA logistic choice model where free-choice behavior is driven by the weighted difference in observed expected rewards between the two options and a bonus factor associated with longer horizons, plus an intercept bias.

  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Psychological mechanisms: Participants learn about each option\u2019s potential based on observed rewards during forced trials (via expected_reward0 and expected_reward1) and then use these estimates when making free choices. In addition, the horizon (number of free choices available: 1 vs. 6) acts as a contextual cue that promotes exploration when many future choices are available. Finally, a general response bias might be present.\n2. Interactions: The participant\u2019s decision in a free-choice trial is assumed to arise from a combination of the difference in estimated rewards across options (exploitation) and the influence of horizon (exploration bonus when horizon is high), along with an overall bias. The difference in expected rewards is weighted by a parameter that reflects sensitivity (or inverse temperature), while the horizon factor is included as a bonus when the horizon is long.\n3. Mathematical form: A logistic regression (softmax) formulation is used so that the computed utility difference is mapped onto the probability of choosing option 1. In our model, the utility difference is a linear combination of (a) the difference in expected rewards, (b) a horizon factor, and (c) an intercept bias.\n4. Required parameters: \n   \u2022 A reward sensitivity parameter, beta_reward, which scales the expected reward difference.\n   \u2022 A horizon effect parameter, beta_horizon, which scales how much an elevated number of free choices influences utility; the horizon variable is normalized to an indicator (0 for horizon=1 and 1 for horizon=6).\n   \u2022 An intercept bias parameter, bias.\n   Finite bounds are provided for each learnable parameter.\n5. Mapping to observable behavior: The model uses the observed expected_reward0, expected_reward1, and horizon from the dataset (only for free-choice trials where forced_choice == FALSE) to compute a utility difference. This utility then feeds a logistic function to yield the probability of choosing option 1, thereby predicting the 'choice' variable.\n\nBelow is the formal specification.\n\n<MODEL>\np = 1/(1+exp(-(beta_reward*(expected_reward1 - expected_reward0) + beta_horizon*((horizon-1)/5) + bias)))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"p\": {\n      \"description\": \"Probability of choosing option 1 on a free-choice trial\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta_reward\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to the difference in expected rewards between option 1 and option 0\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta_horizon\": {\n      \"description\": \"Scaling parameter for the horizon effect, applied to indicator variable (0 for horizon=1, 1 for horizon=6)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"bias\": {\n      \"description\": \"Intercept bias parameter reflecting overall tendency to choose option 1\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous plays in the game\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous plays in the game\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"horizon\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of free-choice trials available in the current game (1 or 6)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>choice</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA logistic choice model where free-choice behavior is driven by the weighted difference in observed expected rewards between the two options and a bonus factor associated with longer horizons, plus an intercept bias.
