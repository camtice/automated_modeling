  "task_description": "Participants played 320 games (in four blocks of 80 games) of our Horizon task (see Figure\n1A). Each game lasted either five or 10 trials and the two game lengths were interleaved and\ncounter-balanced such that there were 160 games of each length.\nIn each game, participants made repeated decisions between two options. Each option paid\nout between 1 and 100 points that was sampled (rounded to the nearest integer) from a\nGaussian distribution with a fixed standard deviation of 8 points. The generative means of\nthe underlying Gaussians were different for the two options and remained stable within a\ngame. In each game, the mean of one option was set to either 40 or 60 points and the mean\nof the other was set relative to the mean of the first, such that the difference between the two\nwas sampled from 4, 8, 12, 20, and 30. Both the identity and the difference in means were\ncounterbalanced over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were instructed in the task with the use of a set of illustrated onscreen\ninstructions. These explicitly conveyed that the means of the two options were constant over\na game and that the variability in the options was constant over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were told to maximize the points they earned and that one option was always\nbetter on average. The full text of the instructions is provided in the Supplementary Material.\nChoice and outcome history in each game remained onscreen inside each of the slot\nmachines (Figure 1A). After a particular option was played, the reward on that trial was\nadded to the slot machine, whereas the corresponding space for the unplayed option was\nfilled with an \u201cXX.\u201d\nThe first four trials of each game were forced-choice trials, in which only one of the options\n(cued by a green square inside the next available space) was available for participants to\nchoose. We used these forced-choice trials to manipulate the information participants had\nabout the two options from experience (Hertwig, Barron, Weber, & Erev, 2004) before their\nfirst free choice, while maintaining their active engagement in the task. The four forcedchoice trials set up two information conditions: \u201cunequal information\u201d (or [1 3]), in which\none option was forced to be played once and the other three times, and \u201cequal information\u201d\n(or [2 2]), in which each option was forced to be played twice.\nCrucially, this manipulation ensured that participants were exposed to a specified amount of\ninformation about each option, regardless of how rewarding it was. Furthermore, the relative\namount of information provided about each option was independent of the relative difference\nin their means.

      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Key psychological mechanisms: In this task participants use sample\u2010based estimates of rewards (i.e., the sample mean values from forced and free plays) to compute an expected value (exploitation). In addition, they are known to incorporate an \u201cinformation bonus\u201d (exploration) that values options with less sampling (i.e., greater uncertainty). Moreover, the number of upcoming free choices (horizon) can modulate the weight on exploration.\n2. How they interact: On free-choice trials, the decision process is assumed to weight the difference in expected rewards as well as any bonus for the option with lower sampling. A softmax (logistic) policy then converts the overall utility difference into a binary choice.\n3. Mathematical form: For each option i, we assume a utility U_i = expected_reward_i + exploration_bonus. The exploration bonus is given by a term proportional to the inverse square\u2010root of the number of observations (n_i) (since variance decreases roughly as 1/n) and is scaled by a factor gamma and by the horizon value (i.e., number of free choices). The decision variable is then the difference in utility between the two options.\n4. Parameters:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 beta_temp: inverse temperature, controlling sensitivity to utility differences.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 gamma: exploration bonus weight parameter, scaling the bonus derived from uncertainty (i.e., fewer observations give a positive bonus).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 bias: an additive intercept capturing any overall bias.\n\u2003\u2003Additionally, the number of forced observations (n0 and n1) for options 0 and 1 (which can be computed from the forced_choice trials in the current game) modulate the exploration bonus.\n5. Mapping to observed behavior: The computed utilities using expected_reward0 and expected_reward1 plus the exploration bonus combine into a value difference that is then transformed via a logistic function to yield the probability of choosing option 1 (the target variable \u2018choice\u2019 on free\u2010choice trials).\n\nThe formal model is provided below.\n\n<MODEL>\np(choice=1) = 1/(1 + exp(- ( beta_temp * ( (expected_reward1 - expected_reward0) + gamma * horizon * ((n1)^(-0.5) - (n0)^(-0.5)) ) + bias ))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"expected_reward0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 0 based on prior plays in the current game\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 1 based on prior plays in the current game\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"horizon\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of free-choice trials available in the current game (1 or 6)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"n0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of times option 0 was sampled (from forced choices and previous free choices) before the current decision\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 320,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"n1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of times option 1 was sampled (from forced choices and previous free choices) before the current decision\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 320,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta_temp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Inverse temperature parameter controlling sensitivity to utility differences\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"gamma\": {\n      \"description\": \"Exploration bonus weight parameter scaling the inverse-square-root uncertainty bonus\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -50,\n        \"max\": 50,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"bias\": {\n      \"description\": \"Additive bias term capturing any overall preference\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -100,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>choice</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA binary choice model where on free\u2010choice trials each option\u2019s utility is computed as its observed mean reward augmented by an exploration bonus that is proportional to the inverse square-root of the observed count.

  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Key psychological mechanisms: In this task participants use sample\u2010based estimates of rewards (i.e., the sample mean values from forced and free plays) to compute an expected value (exploitation). In addition, they are known to incorporate an \u201cinformation bonus\u201d (exploration) that values options with less sampling (i.e., greater uncertainty). Moreover, the number of upcoming free choices (horizon) can modulate the weight on exploration.\n2. How they interact: On free-choice trials, the decision process is assumed to weight the difference in expected rewards as well as any bonus for the option with lower sampling. A softmax (logistic) policy then converts the overall utility difference into a binary choice.\n3. Mathematical form: For each option i, we assume a utility U_i = expected_reward_i + exploration_bonus. The exploration bonus is given by a term proportional to the inverse square\u2010root of the number of observations (n_i) (since variance decreases roughly as 1/n) and is scaled by a factor gamma and by the horizon value (i.e., number of free choices). The decision variable is then the difference in utility between the two options.\n4. Parameters:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 beta_temp: inverse temperature, controlling sensitivity to utility differences.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 gamma: exploration bonus weight parameter, scaling the bonus derived from uncertainty (i.e., fewer observations give a positive bonus).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 bias: an additive intercept capturing any overall bias.\n\u2003\u2003Additionally, the number of forced observations (n0 and n1) for options 0 and 1 (which can be computed from the forced_choice trials in the current game) modulate the exploration bonus.\n5. Mapping to observed behavior: The computed utilities using expected_reward0 and expected_reward1 plus the exploration bonus combine into a value difference that is then transformed via a logistic function to yield the probability of choosing option 1 (the target variable \u2018choice\u2019 on free\u2010choice trials).\n\nThe formal model is provided below.\n\n<MODEL>\np(choice=1) = 1/(1 + exp(- ( beta_temp * ( (expected_reward1 - expected_reward0) + gamma * horizon * ((n1)^(-0.5) - (n0)^(-0.5)) ) + bias ))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"expected_reward0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 0 based on prior plays in the current game\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 1 based on prior plays in the current game\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"horizon\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of free-choice trials available in the current game (1 or 6)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"n0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of times option 0 was sampled (from forced choices and previous free choices) before the current decision\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 320,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"n1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of times option 1 was sampled (from forced choices and previous free choices) before the current decision\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 320,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta_temp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Inverse temperature parameter controlling sensitivity to utility differences\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"gamma\": {\n      \"description\": \"Exploration bonus weight parameter scaling the inverse-square-root uncertainty bonus\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -50,\n        \"max\": 50,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"bias\": {\n      \"description\": \"Additive bias term capturing any overall preference\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -100,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>choice</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA binary choice model where on free\u2010choice trials each option\u2019s utility is computed as its observed mean reward augmented by an exploration bonus that is proportional to the inverse square-root of the observed count.

The bonus is scaled by the horizon and a learnable exploration parameter. The difference in utilities is then mapped through a logistic function, with an additional bias term, to predict the probability of choosing option 1.\nTarget Variable: choice\nPrediction Type: utility\nBIC: 3258.2905742047633\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- beta_temp: r = 0.331\n- gamma: r = -0.004\n- bias: r = 0.578"
