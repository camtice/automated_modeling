  "task_description": "Participants played 320 games (in four blocks of 80 games) of our Horizon task (see Figure\n1A). Each game lasted either five or 10 trials and the two game lengths were interleaved and\ncounter-balanced such that there were 160 games of each length.\nIn each game, participants made repeated decisions between two options. Each option paid\nout between 1 and 100 points that was sampled (rounded to the nearest integer) from a\nGaussian distribution with a fixed standard deviation of 8 points. The generative means of\nthe underlying Gaussians were different for the two options and remained stable within a\ngame. In each game, the mean of one option was set to either 40 or 60 points and the mean\nof the other was set relative to the mean of the first, such that the difference between the two\nwas sampled from 4, 8, 12, 20, and 30. Both the identity and the difference in means were\ncounterbalanced over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were instructed in the task with the use of a set of illustrated onscreen\ninstructions. These explicitly conveyed that the means of the two options were constant over\na game and that the variability in the options was constant over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were told to maximize the points they earned and that one option was always\nbetter on average. The full text of the instructions is provided in the Supplementary Material.\nChoice and outcome history in each game remained onscreen inside each of the slot\nmachines (Figure 1A). After a particular option was played, the reward on that trial was\nadded to the slot machine, whereas the corresponding space for the unplayed option was\nfilled with an \u201cXX.\u201d\nThe first four trials of each game were forced-choice trials, in which only one of the options\n(cued by a green square inside the next available space) was available for participants to\nchoose. We used these forced-choice trials to manipulate the information participants had\nabout the two options from experience (Hertwig, Barron, Weber, & Erev, 2004) before their\nfirst free choice, while maintaining their active engagement in the task. The four forcedchoice trials set up two information conditions: \u201cunequal information\u201d (or [1 3]), in which\none option was forced to be played once and the other three times, and \u201cequal information\u201d\n(or [2 2]), in which each option was forced to be played twice.\nCrucially, this manipulation ensured that participants were exposed to a specified amount of\ninformation about each option, regardless of how rewarding it was.

      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The key mechanism is that participants compare the expected rewards of the two options based on their prior experience (as captured by expected_reward0 and expected_reward1). In addition, the \u201chorizon\u201d variable (1 or 6 free choices) is used to capture a potential exploration bonus: when the horizon is long (horizon==6) participants may be more prone to explore, altering their decision even if the expected reward difference is similar.\n\n2. These mechanisms interact so that the overall value of each option is a combination of its observed expected reward plus an additive bonus when the decision is made in a long-horizon context. We model the decision as a binary choice where the probability of choosing option 1 depends on the difference in these utilities through a logistic (sigmoid) function.\n\n3. In mathematical form, we first compute the difference in expected rewards (d = expected_reward1 \u2013 expected_reward0). We then add an exploration (or horizon) bonus that is active when the horizon is long. This bonus is determined by a learnable parameter multiplied by an indicator variable for long horizon. The weighted sum of these components is passed through a logistic function to yield the probability of choosing option 1.\n\n4. The model uses two learnable parameters: a reward sensitivity parameter (beta) and an exploration bonus parameter (eta). The parameter beta scales the influence of the difference in expected rewards and is constrained to be positive. The parameter eta adds (or subtracts) utility when the trial is in a long-horizon game, with generous finite bounds.\n\n5. Observable behavior (i.e., the binary choice recorded in the choice variable) is mapped via the logistic function applied to the weighted difference (reward difference plus exploration bonus) to generate a choice probability. A higher probability of choosing option 1 indicates that the net utility (reward plus potential exploration bonus) is relatively high.\n\nBelow is the formal specification of the model:\n\n<MODEL>\np = 1/(1 + exp(- (beta*(expected_reward1 - expected_reward0) + eta*H)))\n</MODEL>\n\nIn this formula, H is an indicator variable defined as H = 1 if horizon = 6 and H = 0 if horizon = 1.\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"expected_reward0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"horizon\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of free choices available in the current game (1 or 6)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"H\": {\n      \"description\": \"Horizon indicator variable (1 if horizon equals 6, otherwise 0)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Reward sensitivity parameter scaling the difference in expected rewards\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.001,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"eta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Exploration bonus parameter that adds utility when horizon equals 6\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -20,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"p\": {\n      \"description\": \"Probability of choosing option 1 as computed by the logistic function\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>choice</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA logistic choice model where the probability of a free-choice decision for option 1 is determined by the weighted difference in observed expected rewards and an exploration bonus that is active in long-horizon (6 free choices) games, using two learnable parameters: a reward sensitivity (beta) and an exploration bonus (eta).\n</SUMMARY>"

  "target_variable": "choice",
  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The key mechanism is that participants compare the expected rewards of the two options based on their prior experience (as captured by expected_reward0 and expected_reward1). In addition, the \u201chorizon\u201d variable (1 or 6 free choices) is used to capture a potential exploration bonus: when the horizon is long (horizon==6) participants may be more prone to explore, altering their decision even if the expected reward difference is similar.\n\n2. These mechanisms interact so that the overall value of each option is a combination of its observed expected reward plus an additive bonus when the decision is made in a long-horizon context. We model the decision as a binary choice where the probability of choosing option 1 depends on the difference in these utilities through a logistic (sigmoid) function.\n\n3. In mathematical form, we first compute the difference in expected rewards (d = expected_reward1 \u2013 expected_reward0). We then add an exploration (or horizon) bonus that is active when the horizon is long. This bonus is determined by a learnable parameter multiplied by an indicator variable for long horizon. The weighted sum of these components is passed through a logistic function to yield the probability of choosing option 1.\n\n4. The model uses two learnable parameters: a reward sensitivity parameter (beta) and an exploration bonus parameter (eta). The parameter beta scales the influence of the difference in expected rewards and is constrained to be positive. The parameter eta adds (or subtracts) utility when the trial is in a long-horizon game, with generous finite bounds.\n\n5. Observable behavior (i.e., the binary choice recorded in the choice variable) is mapped via the logistic function applied to the weighted difference (reward difference plus exploration bonus) to generate a choice probability. A higher probability of choosing option 1 indicates that the net utility (reward plus potential exploration bonus) is relatively high.\n\nBelow is the formal specification of the model:\n\n<MODEL>\np = 1/(1 + exp(- (beta*(expected_reward1 - expected_reward0) + eta*H)))\n</MODEL>\n\nIn this formula, H is an indicator variable defined as H = 1 if horizon = 6 and H = 0 if horizon = 1.\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"expected_reward0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"horizon\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of free choices available in the current game (1 or 6)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"H\": {\n      \"description\": \"Horizon indicator variable (1 if horizon equals 6, otherwise 0)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Reward sensitivity parameter scaling the difference in expected rewards\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.001,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"eta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Exploration bonus parameter that adds utility when horizon equals 6\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -20,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"p\": {\n      \"description\": \"Probability of choosing option 1 as computed by the logistic function\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>choice</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA logistic choice model where the probability of a free-choice decision for option 1 is determined by the weighted difference in observed expected rewards and an exploration bonus that is active in long-horizon (6 free choices) games, using two learnable parameters: a reward sensitivity (beta) and an exploration bonus (eta).\n</SUMMARY>",
