  "task_description": "Participants played 320 games (in four blocks of 80 games) of our Horizon task (see Figure\n1A). Each game lasted either five or 10 trials and the two game lengths were interleaved and\ncounter-balanced such that there were 160 games of each length.\nIn each game, participants made repeated decisions between two options. Each option paid\nout between 1 and 100 points that was sampled (rounded to the nearest integer) from a\nGaussian distribution with a fixed standard deviation of 8 points. The generative means of\nthe underlying Gaussians were different for the two options and remained stable within a\ngame. In each game, the mean of one option was set to either 40 or 60 points and the mean\nof the other was set relative to the mean of the first, such that the difference between the two\nwas sampled from 4, 8, 12, 20, and 30. Both the identity and the difference in means were\ncounterbalanced over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were instructed in the task with the use of a set of illustrated onscreen\ninstructions. These explicitly conveyed that the means of the two options were constant over\na game and that the variability in the options was constant over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were told to maximize the points they earned and that one option was always\nbetter on average. The full text of the instructions is provided in the Supplementary Material.\nChoice and outcome history in each game remained onscreen inside each of the slot\nmachines (Figure 1A). After a particular option was played, the reward on that trial was\nadded to the slot machine, whereas the corresponding space for the unplayed option was\nfilled with an \u201cXX.\u201d\nThe first four trials of each game were forced-choice trials, in which only one of the options\n(cued by a green square inside the next available space) was available for participants to\nchoose. We used these forced-choice trials to manipulate the information participants had\nabout the two options from experience (Hertwig, Barron, Weber, & Erev, 2004) before their\nfirst free choice, while maintaining their active engagement in the task. The four forcedchoice trials set up two information conditions: \u201cunequal information\u201d (or [1 3]), in which\none option was forced to be played once and the other three times, and \u201cequal information\u201d\n(or [2 2]), in which each option was forced to be played twice.\nCrucially, this manipulation ensured that participants were exposed to a specified amount of\ninformation about each option, regardless of how rewarding it was. Furthermore, the relative\namount of information provided about each option was independent of the relative difference\nin their means. Thus on the first free choice (the fifth trial in each game), the difference in\nthe number of times each option had been sampled (and hence the difference in available\ninformation) had no effect on the difference in mean payout of that option (repeatedmeasures ANOVA,\nF(2, 89) = 0.09,\np = .91) thus removing the reward\u2013information\nconfound on this trial.\nAfter the forced-choice trials, participants made either one or six free choices (Figure 1B).\nAt the beginning of each game, the number of upcoming free-choice trials (i.e., the horizon)\n\n\nBelow is the description of each variable in the dataset, which will be followed by information about the data type of the variable:\n\nparticipant = [Unique identifier for each human subject in the experiment]\ntask = [Identifier for the specific game/round the participant is playing]\ntrial = [Sequential number indicating which decision point this is within a game]\nchoice = [The option (0 or 1) that the participant selected on this trial]\nreward = [The number of points (1-100) received after making a choice]\nRT = [Reaction time measuring how long it took the participant to make their decision]\nexpected_reward0 = [The observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous forced/free plays]\nexpected_reward1 = [The observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous forced/free plays]\nforced_choice = [Boolean indicator of whether this was a forced-choice trial (1) or free-choice trial (0)]\nhorizon = [The number of free choices available in the current game (either 1 or 6)]\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- Unnamed: 0 (int64)\n- ID (int64)\n- task (int64)\n- trial (int64)\n- choice (int64)\n- reward (float64)\n- RT (float64)\n- expected_reward0 (int64)\n- expected_reward1 (int64)\n- forced_choice (bool)\n- horizon (int64)\n\nNumber of observations: 144000\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- Unnamed: 0 (int64)\n- ID (int64)\n- task (int64)\n- trial (int64)\n- choice (int64)\n- reward (float64)\n- RT (float64)\n- expected_reward0 (int64)\n- expected_reward1 (int64)\n- forced_choice (bool)\n- horizon (int64)\n\nNumber of observations: 144000",

      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Key psychological mechanisms: In this sequential decision task, participants must balance exploitation (choosing the option with the highest expected reward, given by their observed means) with exploration (choosing the option for which they have less information). The task\u2019s design\u2014with forced-choice trials that sometimes yield unequal amounts of information between the two options\u2014allows us to model an exploration bonus that favors the less-sampled option. In particular, when many free\u2010choices remain (i.e. a high horizon) an exploration bonus should bias choices toward the less-certain option.\n\n2. Interaction of mechanisms: We assume that on free-choice trials (forced_choice = FALSE), participants compute a \u201cutility\u201d for each option by combining the observed mean reward from previous forced and free plays (expected_reward) with an exploration bonus. That bonus is scaled by the horizon (so that exploration is weighted less when only one free choice is available) and is inversely related to the square\u2010root of the number of times that option was observed in the forced phase (N_i). This mechanism encapsulates the intuition that options sampled less (and hence more uncertain) receive a bonus to encourage exploration.\n\n3. Mathematical form: For each option i (i = 0, 1) we can write:\n\u2003\u2003U_i = expected_reward_i + xi * (horizon - 1) / sqrt(N_i)\nwhere xi is a learnable parameter that scales the exploration bonus and N_i is the number of forced observations for option i. The decision rule then uses the difference in utilities in a softmax (here, logistic) function:\n\u2003\u2003P(choice = 1) = 1 / (1 + exp( -tau * (U_1 - U_0) )),\nwith tau being the inverse temperature parameter determining choice stochasticity.\n\n4. Learnable parameters: We introduce two learnable parameters:\n\u2003\u2022 xi: The exploration bonus parameter with generous bounds ([-100, 100]).\n\u2003\u2022 tau: The inverse temperature parameter controlling decision noise (bounded in [0.0001, 100]).  \nTheir interaction is kept as simple as possible in order to avoid issues with parameter covariance.\n\n5. Mapping to observable behavior: On every free-choice trial, participants\u2019 choices (variable \"choice\") are predicted by comparing the utilities computed for the two options using the above formula. The expected_reward variables come directly from the dataset, and the forced trial counts (N_0 and N_1) are computed (or assumed known) from the forced-choice portion of each game.

  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Key psychological mechanisms: In this sequential decision task, participants must balance exploitation (choosing the option with the highest expected reward, given by their observed means) with exploration (choosing the option for which they have less information). The task\u2019s design\u2014with forced-choice trials that sometimes yield unequal amounts of information between the two options\u2014allows us to model an exploration bonus that favors the less-sampled option. In particular, when many free\u2010choices remain (i.e. a high horizon) an exploration bonus should bias choices toward the less-certain option.\n\n2. Interaction of mechanisms: We assume that on free-choice trials (forced_choice = FALSE), participants compute a \u201cutility\u201d for each option by combining the observed mean reward from previous forced and free plays (expected_reward) with an exploration bonus. That bonus is scaled by the horizon (so that exploration is weighted less when only one free choice is available) and is inversely related to the square\u2010root of the number of times that option was observed in the forced phase (N_i). This mechanism encapsulates the intuition that options sampled less (and hence more uncertain) receive a bonus to encourage exploration.\n\n3. Mathematical form: For each option i (i = 0, 1) we can write:\n\u2003\u2003U_i = expected_reward_i + xi * (horizon - 1) / sqrt(N_i)\nwhere xi is a learnable parameter that scales the exploration bonus and N_i is the number of forced observations for option i. The decision rule then uses the difference in utilities in a softmax (here, logistic) function:\n\u2003\u2003P(choice = 1) = 1 / (1 + exp( -tau * (U_1 - U_0) )),\nwith tau being the inverse temperature parameter determining choice stochasticity.\n\n4. Learnable parameters: We introduce two learnable parameters:\n\u2003\u2022 xi: The exploration bonus parameter with generous bounds ([-100, 100]).\n\u2003\u2022 tau: The inverse temperature parameter controlling decision noise (bounded in [0.0001, 100]).  \nTheir interaction is kept as simple as possible in order to avoid issues with parameter covariance.\n\n5. Mapping to observable behavior: On every free-choice trial, participants\u2019 choices (variable \"choice\") are predicted by comparing the utilities computed for the two options using the above formula. The expected_reward variables come directly from the dataset, and the forced trial counts (N_0 and N_1) are computed (or assumed known) from the forced-choice portion of each game. The horizon variable modulates the exploitation versus exploration trade-off.\n\nBelow is the formal specification.\n\n<MODEL>\nU_0 = expected_reward0 + xi * (horizon - 1) / sqrt(N_0)\nU_1 = expected_reward1 + xi * (horizon - 1) / sqrt(N_1)\nP(choice=1) = 1/(1+exp(-tau*(U_1-U_0)))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"expected_reward0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous forced/free plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous forced/free plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"horizon\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of free choices available in the current game\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"N_0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of forced trial observations for option 0 in the current game\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 3,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"N_1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of forced trial observations for option 1 in the current game\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 3,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"xi\": {\n      \"description\": \"Exploration bonus parameter weighting the uncertainty (unsampled options get a bonus)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -100,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"tau\": {\n      \"description\": \"Inverse temperature parameter governing the stochasticity of choice\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.0001,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"choice\": {\n      \"description\": \"Participant's binary choice on free-choice trials (0 or 1)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>choice</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA binary choice model that computes option utilities from observed expected rewards and an uncertainty bonus scaled by the game\u2019s horizon.
