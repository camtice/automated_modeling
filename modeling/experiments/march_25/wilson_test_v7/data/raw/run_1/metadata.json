  "task_description": "Participants played 320 games (in four blocks of 80 games) of our Horizon task (see Figure\n1A). Each game lasted either five or 10 trials and the two game lengths were interleaved and\ncounter-balanced such that there were 160 games of each length.\nIn each game, participants made repeated decisions between two options. Each option paid\nout between 1 and 100 points that was sampled (rounded to the nearest integer) from a\nGaussian distribution with a fixed standard deviation of 8 points. The generative means of\nthe underlying Gaussians were different for the two options and remained stable within a\ngame. In each game, the mean of one option was set to either 40 or 60 points and the mean\nof the other was set relative to the mean of the first, such that the difference between the two\nwas sampled from 4, 8, 12, 20, and 30. Both the identity and the difference in means were\ncounterbalanced over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were instructed in the task with the use of a set of illustrated onscreen\ninstructions. These explicitly conveyed that the means of the two options were constant over\na game and that the variability in the options was constant over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were told to maximize the points they earned and that one option was always\nbetter on average. The full text of the instructions is provided in the Supplementary Material.\nChoice and outcome history in each game remained onscreen inside each of the slot\nmachines (Figure 1A). After a particular option was played, the reward on that trial was\nadded to the slot machine, whereas the corresponding space for the unplayed option was\nfilled with an \u201cXX.\u201d\nThe first four trials of each game were forced-choice trials, in which only one of the options\n(cued by a green square inside the next available space) was available for participants to\nchoose. We used these forced-choice trials to manipulate the information participants had\nabout the two options from experience (Hertwig, Barron, Weber, & Erev, 2004) before their\nfirst free choice, while maintaining their active engagement in the task. The four forcedchoice trials set up two information conditions: \u201cunequal information\u201d (or [1 3]), in which\none option was forced to be played once and the other three times, and \u201cequal information\u201d\n(or [2 2]), in which each option was forced to be played twice.\nCrucially, this manipulation ensured that participants were exposed to a specified amount of\ninformation about each option, regardless of how rewarding it was. Furthermore, the relative\namount of information provided about each option was independent of the relative difference\nin their means. Thus on the first free choice (the fifth trial in each game), the difference in\nthe number of times each option had been sampled (and hence the difference in available\ninformation) had no effect on the difference in mean payout of that option (repeatedmeasures ANOVA,\nF(2, 89) = 0.09,\np = .91) thus removing the reward\u2013information\nconfound on this trial.\nAfter the forced-choice trials, participants made either one or six free choices (Figure 1B).\nAt the beginning of each game, the number of upcoming free-choice trials (i.e., the horizon)\n\n\nBelow is the description of each variable in the dataset, which will be followed by information about the data type of the variable:\n\nparticipant = [Unique identifier for each human subject in the experiment]\ntask = [Identifier for the specific game/round the participant is playing]\ntrial = [Sequential number indicating which decision point this is within a game]\nchoice = [The option (0 or 1) that the participant selected on this trial]\nreward = [The number of points (1-100) received after making a choice]\nRT = [Reaction time measuring how long it took the participant to make their decision]\nexpected_reward0 = [The observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous forced/free plays]\nexpected_reward1 = [The observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous forced/free plays]\nforced_choice = [Boolean indicator of whether this was a forced-choice trial (1) or free-choice trial (0)]\nhorizon = [The number of free choices available in the current game (either 1 or 6)]\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- Unnamed: 0 (int64)\n- ID (int64)\n- task (int64)\n- trial (int64)\n- choice (int64)\n- reward (float64)\n- RT (float64)\n- expected_reward0 (int64)\n- expected_reward1 (int64)\n- forced_choice (bool)\n- horizon (int64)\n\nNumber of observations: 144000\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- Unnamed: 0 (int64)\n- ID (int64)\n- task (int64)\n- trial (int64)\n- choice (int64)\n- reward (float64)\n- RT (float64)\n- expected_reward0 (int64)\n- expected_reward1 (int64)\n- forced_choice (bool)\n- horizon (int64)\n\nNumber of observations: 144000",

      "output": "Step 1 \u2013 Psychological Mechanisms:\n\u2022 Participants track the benefits of each option by integrating the outcomes shown during the forced\u2010choice trials. This gives rise to an exploitation signal based on the observed (sampled) mean rewards.\n\u2022 They also \u201cexplore\u201d when there is less information about an option. Because the forced-choice design sometimes exposes one option only once (unequal information) and the other three times, there is an asymmetric uncertainty (information) signal.\n\u2022 The net decision is assumed to arise from a combination of the exploitation (expected reward) and an exploration bonus that is weighted by the available horizon (free\u2010choice count).\n\u2022 Since in the design the forced\u2010choice sampling difference is independent of the underlying reward difference, the model should include an additive bonus term that factors in the predetermined information imbalance.\n\u2022 Mathematically, we can capture the process by taking a linear combination of the difference in the observed expected rewards and the (pre\u2010computed) information bonus. The bonus term is modulated by the horizon (with a factor of 0 when only one free choice is available and reaching full effect when six free choices are available).\n\u2022 The model has two learnable parameters: one scaling the exploitation value (alpha) and one scaling the exploration bonus (delta). Their bounds are set to generous finite values to aid parameter recovery.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Mathematical Form:\nFor each free\u2010choice trial (forced_choice = FALSE) we compute the utility difference between choosing option 1 and option 0 as\n\n\u2003\u2003U = alpha * (expected_reward1 \u2013 expected_reward0) + delta * ((horizon \u2013 1)/5) * info_bonus\n\nHere, info_bonus is a calculated variable that equals:\n\u2003\u2003+2 if option 1 was sampled less than option 0 (i.e. in the unequal forced\u2010choice condition),\n\u2003\u2003\u20132 if option 0 was sampled less than option 1,\n\u2003\u20030 if the forced sampling was equal.\n\nThis utility value is then fed into a logistic function (outside our model) to yield choice probabilities. Negative values of U make option 1 less likely, and positive values make it more likely.\n\nBelow is the formal model specification.\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha*(expected_reward1 - expected_reward0) + delta*((horizon - 1)/5)*info_bonus\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility difference between option 1 and option 0 used to drive binary choice\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight on the exploitation (observed expected reward difference) component\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"lower\": 0,\n          \"upper\": 100\n        }\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"delta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight on the exploration bonus (information imbalance) component\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -100,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"lower\": -100,\n          \"upper\": 100\n        }\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous forced/free plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous forced/free plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"horizon\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of free choices available in the current game (either 1 or 6)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"info_bonus\": {\n      \"description\": \"Calculated information bonus that reflects the forced-choice sampling imbalance: +2 if option 1 was sampled less, -2 if option 0 was sampled less, 0 if equal\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -2,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>choice</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA linear utility model where the decision utility is a weighted sum of the difference in observed expected rewards (exploitation) and a scaled exploration bonus determined by the forced-choice sampling imbalance and modulated by the available horizon.

This gives rise to an exploitation signal based on the observed (sampled) mean rewards.\n\u2022 They also \u201cexplore\u201d when there is less information about an option. Because the forced-choice design sometimes exposes one option only once (unequal information) and the other three times, there is an asymmetric uncertainty (information) signal.\n\u2022 The net decision is assumed to arise from a combination of the exploitation (expected reward) and an exploration bonus that is weighted by the available horizon (free\u2010choice count).\n\u2022 Since in the design the forced\u2010choice sampling difference is independent of the underlying reward difference, the model should include an additive bonus term that factors in the predetermined information imbalance.\n\u2022 Mathematically, we can capture the process by taking a linear combination of the difference in the observed expected rewards and the (pre\u2010computed) information bonus. The bonus term is modulated by the horizon (with a factor of 0 when only one free choice is available and reaching full effect when six free choices are available).\n\u2022 The model has two learnable parameters: one scaling the exploitation value (alpha) and one scaling the exploration bonus (delta). Their bounds are set to generous finite values to aid parameter recovery.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Mathematical Form:\nFor each free\u2010choice trial (forced_choice = FALSE) we compute the utility difference between choosing option 1 and option 0 as\n\n\u2003\u2003U = alpha * (expected_reward1 \u2013 expected_reward0) + delta * ((horizon \u2013 1)/5) * info_bonus\n\nHere, info_bonus is a calculated variable that equals:\n\u2003\u2003+2 if option 1 was sampled less than option 0 (i.e. in the unequal forced\u2010choice condition),\n\u2003\u2003\u20132 if option 0 was sampled less than option 1,\n\u2003\u20030 if the forced sampling was equal.\n\nThis utility value is then fed into a logistic function (outside our model) to yield choice probabilities. Negative values of U make option 1 less likely, and positive values make it more likely.\n\nBelow is the formal model specification.\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha*(expected_reward1 - expected_reward0) + delta*((horizon - 1)/5)*info_bonus\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility difference between option 1 and option 0 used to drive binary choice\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight on the exploitation (observed expected reward difference) component\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"lower\": 0,\n          \"upper\": 100\n        }\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"delta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight on the exploration bonus (information imbalance) component\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -100,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"lower\": -100,\n          \"upper\": 100\n        }\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous forced/free plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous forced/free plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"horizon\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of free choices available in the current game (either 1 or 6)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"info_bonus\": {\n      \"description\": \"Calculated information bonus that reflects the forced-choice sampling imbalance: +2 if option 1 was sampled less, -2 if option 0 was sampled less, 0 if equal\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -2,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>choice</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA linear utility model where the decision utility is a weighted sum of the difference in observed expected rewards (exploitation) and a scaled exploration bonus determined by the forced-choice sampling imbalance and modulated by the available horizon.
