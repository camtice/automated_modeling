1,40366.06761735654,,,U = alpha*(expected_reward1 - expected_reward0) + delta*((horizon - 1)/5)*info_bonus,A linear utility model where the decision utility is a weighted sum of the difference in observed expected rewards (exploitation) and a scaled exploration bonus determined by the forced-choice sampling imbalance and modulated by the available horizon. Two learnable parameters (alpha and delta) govern the reliance on these components.,v7,0.1101986360784381,-0.09402336309065375
