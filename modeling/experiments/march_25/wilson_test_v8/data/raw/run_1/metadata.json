  "task_description": "Participants played 320 games (in four blocks of 80 games) of our Horizon task (see Figure\n1A). Each game lasted either five or 10 trials and the two game lengths were interleaved and\ncounter-balanced such that there were 160 games of each length.\nIn each game, participants made repeated decisions between two options. Each option paid\nout between 1 and 100 points that was sampled (rounded to the nearest integer) from a\nGaussian distribution with a fixed standard deviation of 8 points. The generative means of\nthe underlying Gaussians were different for the two options and remained stable within a\ngame. In each game, the mean of one option was set to either 40 or 60 points and the mean\nof the other was set relative to the mean of the first, such that the difference between the two\nwas sampled from 4, 8, 12, 20, and 30. Both the identity and the difference in means were\ncounterbalanced over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were instructed in the task with the use of a set of illustrated onscreen\ninstructions. These explicitly conveyed that the means of the two options were constant over\na game and that the variability in the options was constant over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were told to maximize the points they earned and that one option was always\nbetter on average. The full text of the instructions is provided in the Supplementary Material.\nChoice and outcome history in each game remained onscreen inside each of the slot\nmachines (Figure 1A). After a particular option was played, the reward on that trial was\nadded to the slot machine, whereas the corresponding space for the unplayed option was\nfilled with an \u201cXX.\u201d\nThe first four trials of each game were forced-choice trials, in which only one of the options\n(cued by a green square inside the next available space) was available for participants to\nchoose. We used these forced-choice trials to manipulate the information participants had\nabout the two options from experience (Hertwig, Barron, Weber, & Erev, 2004) before their\nfirst free choice, while maintaining their active engagement in the task. The four forcedchoice trials set up two information conditions: \u201cunequal information\u201d (or [1 3]), in which\none option was forced to be played once and the other three times, and \u201cequal information\u201d\n(or [2 2]), in which each option was forced to be played twice.\nCrucially, this manipulation ensured that participants were exposed to a specified amount of\ninformation about each option, regardless of how rewarding it was. Furthermore, the relative\namount of information provided about each option was independent of the relative difference\nin their means. Thus on the first free choice (the fifth trial in each game), the difference in\nthe number of times each option had been sampled (and hence the difference in available\ninformation) had no effect on the difference in mean payout of that option (repeatedmeasures ANOVA,\nF(2, 89) = 0.09,\np = .91) thus removing the reward\u2013information\nconfound on this trial.\nAfter the forced-choice trials, participants made either one or six free choices (Figure 1B).\nAt the beginning of each game, the number of upcoming free-choice trials (i.e., the horizon)\n\n\nBelow is the description of each variable in the dataset, which will be followed by information about the data type of the variable:\n\nparticipant = [Unique identifier for each human subject in the experiment]\ntask = [Identifier for the specific game/round the participant is playing]\ntrial = [Sequential number indicating which decision point this is within a game]\nchoice = [The option (0 or 1) that the participant selected on this trial]\nreward = [The number of points (1-100) received after making a choice]\nRT = [Reaction time measuring how long it took the participant to make their decision]\nexpected_reward0 = [The observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous forced/free plays]\nexpected_reward1 = [The observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous forced/free plays]\nforced_choice = [Boolean indicator of whether this was a forced-choice trial (1) or free-choice trial (0)]\nhorizon = [The number of free choices available in the current game (either 1 or 6)]\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- Unnamed: 0 (int64)\n- ID (int64)\n- task (int64)\n- trial (int64)\n- choice (int64)\n- reward (float64)\n- RT (float64)\n- expected_reward0 (int64)\n- expected_reward1 (int64)\n- forced_choice (bool)\n- horizon (int64)\n\nNumber of observations: 144000\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- Unnamed: 0 (int64)\n- ID (int64)\n- task (int64)\n- trial (int64)\n- choice (int64)\n- reward (float64)\n- RT (float64)\n- expected_reward0 (int64)\n- expected_reward1 (int64)\n- forced_choice (bool)\n- horizon (int64)\n\nNumber of observations: 144000",

      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Key psychological mechanisms: Decisions are guided by the observed expected rewards (exploitation) but may also be swayed by an \u201cinformation bonus\u201d that favors the less-sampled (more uncertain) option, especially when more free choices (a longer horizon) allow exploration to pay off. The model thus weighs the trade\u2010off between exploitation (choosing the option with the higher expected reward) and exploration (choosing the option about which less is known).\n\n2. Interactions: The model assumes that the utility for an option is determined by its expected reward and an additional bonus derived from its uncertainty. In games with a long horizon (free choice count H=1 for horizon 6, 0 for horizon 1) the exploration bonus plays a role. Uncertainty is operationalized using the reciprocal of the number of forced observations for that option until the first free choice.\n\n3. Mathematical form: We define the utility difference for choosing option 1 (versus option 0) as a linear combination of (a) the difference in expected rewards and (b) the difference in \u201cinformation bonus\u201d values, the latter being active only in long-horizon games.\n\n4. Parameters: \u2022 beta0: An intercept capturing any baseline preference.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 beta_value: Sensitivity to the difference in expected reward.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 beta_info: Weight given to the information bonus (exploration bonus) in long-horizon games.  \nFinite numerical bounds are assigned to these parameters to avoid unbounded correlations: for example, beta0 \u2208 [-10,10], beta_value \u2208 [0,10] (assumed non-negative to ensure that a higher expected reward increases utility), and beta_info \u2208 [-10,10].\n\n5. Mapping to observable behavior: Q0 and Q1 are taken from expected_reward0 and expected_reward1 in the dataset. The forced sampling information is used to calculate n0 and n1 (the number of forced observations for each option in the current game before the first free-choice). The horizon variable indicates whether the free-choice phase is long (H = 1 for horizon 6) or short (H = 0 for horizon 1). The model output, U, is a latent utility difference that, when passed through a logistic function, predicts the binary choice on free-choice trials (forced_choice == FALSE).\n\nBelow is the formal mathematical specification and variable descriptions.\n\n<MODEL>\nU = beta0 + beta_value * (expected_reward1 - expected_reward0) + beta_info * H * ((1/n1) - (1/n0))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility difference between option 1 and option 0; higher U indicates greater likelihood of choosing option 1\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Intercept parameter capturing baseline preference\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta_value\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight on the difference in expected rewards between the two options\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta_info\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight on the exploration bonus derived from the difference in forced-choice sampling (uncertainty) active in long-horizon games\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous forced/free plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous forced/free plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"H\": {\n      \"description\": \"Horizon indicator: 1 if horizon equals 6 (long), 0 if horizon equals 1 (short)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"n0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of forced-choice samples for option 0 in the current game prior to the first free choice\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"n1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of forced-choice samples for option 1 in the current game prior to the first free choice\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>choice</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA dual-component linear utility model that computes the latent utility difference for a binary decision based on the difference in observed expected rewards and an exploration bonus driven by differences in sampling uncertainty from forced-choice trials.

  "target_variable": "choice",
  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Key psychological mechanisms: Decisions are guided by the observed expected rewards (exploitation) but may also be swayed by an \u201cinformation bonus\u201d that favors the less-sampled (more uncertain) option, especially when more free choices (a longer horizon) allow exploration to pay off. The model thus weighs the trade\u2010off between exploitation (choosing the option with the higher expected reward) and exploration (choosing the option about which less is known).\n\n2. Interactions: The model assumes that the utility for an option is determined by its expected reward and an additional bonus derived from its uncertainty. In games with a long horizon (free choice count H=1 for horizon 6, 0 for horizon 1) the exploration bonus plays a role. Uncertainty is operationalized using the reciprocal of the number of forced observations for that option until the first free choice.\n\n3. Mathematical form: We define the utility difference for choosing option 1 (versus option 0) as a linear combination of (a) the difference in expected rewards and (b) the difference in \u201cinformation bonus\u201d values, the latter being active only in long-horizon games.\n\n4. Parameters: \u2022 beta0: An intercept capturing any baseline preference.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 beta_value: Sensitivity to the difference in expected reward.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 beta_info: Weight given to the information bonus (exploration bonus) in long-horizon games.  \nFinite numerical bounds are assigned to these parameters to avoid unbounded correlations: for example, beta0 \u2208 [-10,10], beta_value \u2208 [0,10] (assumed non-negative to ensure that a higher expected reward increases utility), and beta_info \u2208 [-10,10].\n\n5. Mapping to observable behavior: Q0 and Q1 are taken from expected_reward0 and expected_reward1 in the dataset. The forced sampling information is used to calculate n0 and n1 (the number of forced observations for each option in the current game before the first free-choice). The horizon variable indicates whether the free-choice phase is long (H = 1 for horizon 6) or short (H = 0 for horizon 1). The model output, U, is a latent utility difference that, when passed through a logistic function, predicts the binary choice on free-choice trials (forced_choice == FALSE).\n\nBelow is the formal mathematical specification and variable descriptions.\n\n<MODEL>\nU = beta0 + beta_value * (expected_reward1 - expected_reward0) + beta_info * H * ((1/n1) - (1/n0))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility difference between option 1 and option 0; higher U indicates greater likelihood of choosing option 1\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"beta0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Intercept parameter capturing baseline preference\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta_value\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight on the difference in expected rewards between the two options\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta_info\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight on the exploration bonus derived from the difference in forced-choice sampling (uncertainty) active in long-horizon games\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous forced/free plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous forced/free plays\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"H\": {\n      \"description\": \"Horizon indicator: 1 if horizon equals 6 (long), 0 if horizon equals 1 (short)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"n0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of forced-choice samples for option 0 in the current game prior to the first free choice\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"n1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of forced-choice samples for option 1 in the current game prior to the first free choice\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>choice</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA dual-component linear utility model that computes the latent utility difference for a binary decision based on the difference in observed expected rewards and an exploration bonus driven by differences in sampling uncertainty from forced-choice trials.

The exploration bonus is active only in long-horizon games.
