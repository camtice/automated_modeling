  "task_description": "Participants played 320 games (in four blocks of 80 games) of our Horizon task (see Figure\n1A). Each game lasted either five or 10 trials and the two game lengths were interleaved and\ncounter-balanced such that there were 160 games of each length.\nIn each game, participants made repeated decisions between two options. Each option paid\nout between 1 and 100 points that was sampled (rounded to the nearest integer) from a\nGaussian distribution with a fixed standard deviation of 8 points. The generative means of\nthe underlying Gaussians were different for the two options and remained stable within a\ngame. In each game, the mean of one option was set to either 40 or 60 points and the mean\nof the other was set relative to the mean of the first, such that the difference between the two\nwas sampled from 4, 8, 12, 20, and 30. Both the identity and the difference in means were\ncounterbalanced over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were instructed in the task with the use of a set of illustrated onscreen\ninstructions. These explicitly conveyed that the means of the two options were constant over\na game and that the variability in the options was constant over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were told to maximize the points they earned and that one option was always\nbetter on average. The full text of the instructions is provided in the Supplementary Material.\nChoice and outcome history in each game remained onscreen inside each of the slot\nmachines (Figure 1A). After a particular option was played, the reward on that trial was\nadded to the slot machine, whereas the corresponding space for the unplayed option was\nfilled with an \u201cXX.\u201d\nThe first four trials of each game were forced-choice trials, in which only one of the options\n(cued by a green square inside the next available space) was available for participants to\nchoose. We used these forced-choice trials to manipulate the information participants had\nabout the two options from experience (Hertwig, Barron, Weber, & Erev, 2004) before their\nfirst free choice, while maintaining their active engagement in the task. The four forcedchoice trials set up two information conditions: \u201cunequal information\u201d (or [1 3]), in which\none option was forced to be played once and the other three times, and \u201cequal information\u201d\n(or [2 2]), in which each option was forced to be played twice.\nCrucially, this manipulation ensured that participants were exposed to a specified amount of\ninformation about each option, regardless of how rewarding it was. Furthermore, the relative\namount of information provided about each option was independent of the relative difference\nin their means. Thus on the first free choice (the fifth trial in each game), the difference in\nthe number of times each option had been sampled (and hence the difference in available\ninformation) had no effect on the difference in mean payout of that option (repeatedmeasures ANOVA,\nF(2, 89) = 0.09,\np = .91) thus removing the reward\u2013information\nconfound on this trial.\nAfter the forced-choice trials, participants made either one or six free choices (Figure 1B).\nAt the beginning of each game, the number of upcoming free-choice trials (i.e., the horizon)\n\n\nBelow is the description of each variable in the dataset, which will be followed by information about the data type of the variable:\n\nparticipant = [Unique identifier for each human subject in the experiment]\ntask = [Identifier for the specific game/round the participant is playing]\ntrial = [Sequential number indicating which decision point this is within a game]\nchoice = [The option (0 or 1) that the participant selected on this trial]\nreward = [The number of points (1-100) received after making a choice]\nRT = [Reaction time measuring how long it took the participant to make their decision]\nexpected_reward0 = [The observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous forced/free plays]\nexpected_reward1 = [The observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous forced/free plays]\nforced_choice = [Boolean indicator of whether this was a forced-choice trial (1) or free-choice trial (0)]\nhorizon = [The number of free choices available in the current game (either 1 or 6)]\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- Unnamed: 0 (int64)\n- ID (int64)\n- task (int64)\n- trial (int64)\n- choice (int64)\n- reward (float64)\n- RT (float64)\n- expected_reward0 (int64)\n- expected_reward1 (int64)\n- forced_choice (bool)\n- horizon (int64)\n\nNumber of observations: 144000\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- Unnamed: 0 (int64)\n- ID (int64)\n- task (int64)\n- trial (int64)\n- choice (int64)\n- reward (float64)\n- RT (float64)\n- expected_reward0 (int64)\n- expected_reward1 (int64)\n- forced_choice (bool)\n- horizon (int64)\n\nNumber of observations: 144000",

      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Key psychological mechanisms include exploitation of known rewards (using the \u201cexpected_reward\u201d values) and directed exploration driven by uncertainty about the options. In our task the forced\u2010choice phase provides differing amounts of information about the two options (equal information [2,2] vs. unequal [1,3]). When one option is less sampled, its uncertainty is higher, motivating exploration\u2014especially when the horizon (free\u2010choice trials remaining) is long.\n2. These mechanisms interact by linearly combining the exploitation value (the difference in \u201cexpected_reward\u201d) with an exploration bonus that is applied only when the information is unequal. Moreover, because the benefit of exploring is greater when there are more free choices (horizon = 6), the exploration bonus is scaled by (horizon \u2212 1).\n3. A simple mathematical form is to assume that the decision variable (utility) is a weighted sum of the reward difference and an exploration term. The exploration term is defined as an \u201cinformation difference\u201d variable (I) that takes the value +1 if option 1 was sampled fewer times (and is thus more uncertain), \u22121 if option 0 was sampled fewer times, and 0 when both options have equal forced-sample counts.\n4. We need three learnable parameters: a baseline bias (beta_bias), a reward sensitivity weight (beta_reward) for the difference in expected rewards, and an exploration bonus weight (beta_explore) that multiplies both the information difference and the horizon effect. Finite bounds are assigned to each to ensure identifiability and facilitate parameter recovery.\n5. In mapping to observable behavior, the computed utility (U) (a continuous, unbounded value) is transformed later via a logistic function into a probability for choosing option 1.

  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Key psychological mechanisms include exploitation of known rewards (using the \u201cexpected_reward\u201d values) and directed exploration driven by uncertainty about the options. In our task the forced\u2010choice phase provides differing amounts of information about the two options (equal information [2,2] vs. unequal [1,3]). When one option is less sampled, its uncertainty is higher, motivating exploration\u2014especially when the horizon (free\u2010choice trials remaining) is long.\n2. These mechanisms interact by linearly combining the exploitation value (the difference in \u201cexpected_reward\u201d) with an exploration bonus that is applied only when the information is unequal. Moreover, because the benefit of exploring is greater when there are more free choices (horizon = 6), the exploration bonus is scaled by (horizon \u2212 1).\n3. A simple mathematical form is to assume that the decision variable (utility) is a weighted sum of the reward difference and an exploration term. The exploration term is defined as an \u201cinformation difference\u201d variable (I) that takes the value +1 if option 1 was sampled fewer times (and is thus more uncertain), \u22121 if option 0 was sampled fewer times, and 0 when both options have equal forced-sample counts.\n4. We need three learnable parameters: a baseline bias (beta_bias), a reward sensitivity weight (beta_reward) for the difference in expected rewards, and an exploration bonus weight (beta_explore) that multiplies both the information difference and the horizon effect. Finite bounds are assigned to each to ensure identifiability and facilitate parameter recovery.\n5. In mapping to observable behavior, the computed utility (U) (a continuous, unbounded value) is transformed later via a logistic function into a probability for choosing option 1.

The utility is computed as a weighted sum of the difference in expected rewards and an exploration bonus that is activated when the forced-choice sampling is unequal and scaled by the free-choice horizon. Three parameters (baseline bias, reward sensitivity, and exploration bonus) modulate the decision utility, which is later transformed via a logistic function to predict binary free-choice behavior.\nTarget Variable: choice\nPrediction Type: utility\nBIC: 29568.15187868654\nOverall Accuracy: 0.6137\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- beta_bias: r = 0.123\n- beta_reward: r = -0.071\n- beta_explore: r = -0.072"
