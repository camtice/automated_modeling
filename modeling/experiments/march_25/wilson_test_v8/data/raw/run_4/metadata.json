  "task_description": "Participants played 320 games (in four blocks of 80 games) of our Horizon task (see Figure\n1A). Each game lasted either five or 10 trials and the two game lengths were interleaved and\ncounter-balanced such that there were 160 games of each length.\nIn each game, participants made repeated decisions between two options. Each option paid\nout between 1 and 100 points that was sampled (rounded to the nearest integer) from a\nGaussian distribution with a fixed standard deviation of 8 points. The generative means of\nthe underlying Gaussians were different for the two options and remained stable within a\ngame. In each game, the mean of one option was set to either 40 or 60 points and the mean\nof the other was set relative to the mean of the first, such that the difference between the two\nwas sampled from 4, 8, 12, 20, and 30. Both the identity and the difference in means were\ncounterbalanced over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were instructed in the task with the use of a set of illustrated onscreen\ninstructions. These explicitly conveyed that the means of the two options were constant over\na game and that the variability in the options was constant over the entire experiment.\nParticipants were told to maximize the points they earned and that one option was always\nbetter on average. The full text of the instructions is provided in the Supplementary Material.\nChoice and outcome history in each game remained onscreen inside each of the slot\nmachines (Figure 1A). After a particular option was played, the reward on that trial was\nadded to the slot machine, whereas the corresponding space for the unplayed option was\nfilled with an \u201cXX.\u201d\nThe first four trials of each game were forced-choice trials, in which only one of the options\n(cued by a green square inside the next available space) was available for participants to\nchoose. We used these forced-choice trials to manipulate the information participants had\nabout the two options from experience (Hertwig, Barron, Weber, & Erev, 2004) before their\nfirst free choice, while maintaining their active engagement in the task. The four forcedchoice trials set up two information conditions: \u201cunequal information\u201d (or [1 3]), in which\none option was forced to be played once and the other three times, and \u201cequal information\u201d\n(or [2 2]), in which each option was forced to be played twice.\nCrucially, this manipulation ensured that participants were exposed to a specified amount of\ninformation about each option, regardless of how rewarding it was. Furthermore, the relative\namount of information provided about each option was independent of the relative difference\nin their means. Thus on the first free choice (the fifth trial in each game), the difference in\nthe number of times each option had been sampled (and hence the difference in available\ninformation) had no effect on the difference in mean payout of that option (repeatedmeasures ANOVA,\nF(2, 89) = 0.09,\np = .91) thus removing the reward\u2013information\nconfound on this trial.\nAfter the forced-choice trials, participants made either one or six free choices (Figure 1B).\nAt the beginning of each game, the number of upcoming free-choice trials (i.e., the horizon)\n\n\nBelow is the description of each variable in the dataset, which will be followed by information about the data type of the variable:\n\nparticipant = [Unique identifier for each human subject in the experiment]\ntask = [Identifier for the specific game/round the participant is playing]\ntrial = [Sequential number indicating which decision point this is within a game]\nchoice = [The option (0 or 1) that the participant selected on this trial]\nreward = [The number of points (1-100) received after making a choice]\nRT = [Reaction time measuring how long it took the participant to make their decision]\nexpected_reward0 = [The observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous forced/free plays]\nexpected_reward1 = [The observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous forced/free plays]\nforced_choice = [Boolean indicator of whether this was a forced-choice trial (1) or free-choice trial (0)]\nhorizon = [The number of free choices available in the current game (either 1 or 6)]\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- Unnamed: 0 (int64)\n- ID (int64)\n- task (int64)\n- trial (int64)\n- choice (int64)\n- reward (float64)\n- RT (float64)\n- expected_reward0 (int64)\n- expected_reward1 (int64)\n- forced_choice (bool)\n- horizon (int64)\n\nNumber of observations: 144000\n\nDataset:\n\nDataset Structure:\nVariables available:\n- Unnamed: 0 (int64)\n- ID (int64)\n- task (int64)\n- trial (int64)\n- choice (int64)\n- reward (float64)\n- RT (float64)\n- expected_reward0 (int64)\n- expected_reward1 (int64)\n- forced_choice (bool)\n- horizon (int64)\n\nNumber of observations: 144000",

This bonus is scaled by the horizon \u2013 when more free choices are available (horizon = 6), exploration is more \u201cworth it.\u201d\n\u2003\n\u2022 Mathematical form:\n\u2003\u2013 For each option i (i \u2208 {0, 1}), compute a utility as:\n\u2003\u2003U_i = expected_reward_i + (exploration_weight) \u00d7 (horizon) \u00d7 (uncertainty_i)\n\u2003\u2013 Uncertainty is formalized as a function of the number of times each option i has been sampled (n_i); here we use 1/\u221a(n_i) so that fewer samples yield a higher exploration bonus.\n\u2003\u2013 Because logistic choice functions are applied on a utility difference, we set the model\u2019s output to be the difference between the utility of option 1 and utility of option 0.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Parameters required:\n\u2003\u2013 exploration_weight (a learnable parameter with generous finite bounds) determines the degree of bonus given to options with low sample count.\n\u2003\u2013 The scaling on expected rewards is fixed (reward weight=1) to avoid high covariance among learnable parameters.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Mapping to observable behavior:\n\u2003\u2013 expected_reward0 and expected_reward1 are provided from the data.\n\u2003\u2013 The counts n0 and n1 for each option (to be calculated given the forced_choice history within the current game) capture the relative uncertainty.\n\u2003\u2013 horizon modulates the exploration bonus.\n\u2003\u2013 The output utility is then fed into a logistic function to yield the probability of choosing option 1 (with a negative utility making it less probable and positive more probable), which is then compared to the observed choice (0 or 1) in free-choice trials (forced_choice = FALSE).\n\nBelow is the formal specification.\n\n<MODEL>\nV = (expected_reward1 - expected_reward0) + exploration_weight * horizon * (1/sqrt(n1) - 1/sqrt(n0))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"V\": {\n      \"description\": \"Difference in utility between option 1 and option 0, combining exploitation and exploration bonus.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous plays.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous plays.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"horizon\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of available free-choice trials in the current game.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"n0\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of times option 0 has been sampled in the current game before the current trial.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 320,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"n1\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of times option 1 has been sampled in the current game before the current trial.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 320,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"exploration_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"A parameter that scales the exploration bonus based on uncertainty; higher weight increases the bonus for less sampled options.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -50,\n        \"max\": 50,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>choice</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA binary-choice utility model that combines an exploitation term (difference in expected rewards) with an exploration term (bonus proportional to the inverse square-root of the number of samples, reflecting uncertainty) scaled by the horizon.

This bonus is scaled by the horizon \u2013 when more free choices are available (horizon = 6), exploration is more \u201cworth it.\u201d\n\u2003\n\u2022 Mathematical form:\n\u2003\u2013 For each option i (i \u2208 {0, 1}), compute a utility as:\n\u2003\u2003U_i = expected_reward_i + (exploration_weight) \u00d7 (horizon) \u00d7 (uncertainty_i)\n\u2003\u2013 Uncertainty is formalized as a function of the number of times each option i has been sampled (n_i); here we use 1/\u221a(n_i) so that fewer samples yield a higher exploration bonus.\n\u2003\u2013 Because logistic choice functions are applied on a utility difference, we set the model\u2019s output to be the difference between the utility of option 1 and utility of option 0.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Parameters required:\n\u2003\u2013 exploration_weight (a learnable parameter with generous finite bounds) determines the degree of bonus given to options with low sample count.\n\u2003\u2013 The scaling on expected rewards is fixed (reward weight=1) to avoid high covariance among learnable parameters.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Mapping to observable behavior:\n\u2003\u2013 expected_reward0 and expected_reward1 are provided from the data.\n\u2003\u2013 The counts n0 and n1 for each option (to be calculated given the forced_choice history within the current game) capture the relative uncertainty.\n\u2003\u2013 horizon modulates the exploration bonus.\n\u2003\u2013 The output utility is then fed into a logistic function to yield the probability of choosing option 1 (with a negative utility making it less probable and positive more probable), which is then compared to the observed choice (0 or 1) in free-choice trials (forced_choice = FALSE).\n\nBelow is the formal specification.\n\n<MODEL>\nV = (expected_reward1 - expected_reward0) + exploration_weight * horizon * (1/sqrt(n1) - 1/sqrt(n0))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"V\": {\n      \"description\": \"Difference in utility between option 1 and option 0, combining exploitation and exploration bonus.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward0\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 0 based on previous plays.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"expected_reward1\": {\n      \"description\": \"Observed mean reward for option 1 based on previous plays.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"horizon\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of available free-choice trials in the current game.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"n0\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of times option 0 has been sampled in the current game before the current trial.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 320,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"n1\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of times option 1 has been sampled in the current game before the current trial.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 320,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"exploration_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"A parameter that scales the exploration bonus based on uncertainty; higher weight increases the bonus for less sampled options.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -50,\n        \"max\": 50,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<target_variable>choice</target_variable>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA binary-choice utility model that combines an exploitation term (difference in expected rewards) with an exploration term (bonus proportional to the inverse square-root of the number of samples, reflecting uncertainty) scaled by the horizon.
