      "output": "Let me think step-by-step:\n\n### The key psychological mechanisms involved:\nWe observe from previous models that responders react both to monetary gains and fairness concerns. We've tested various inequity aversion models, expectation models (proportional contribution fairness), binary dominance, and loss aversion models. However, we've yet to test a simple, psychologically plausible fairness threshold model. Psychological evidence suggests that individuals might not continuously penalize small unfairness increments; rather, they might exhibit a threshold (tolerance), beyond which unfairness notably reduces utility. Such threshold-based utility models have intuitive appeal and are psychologically realistic.\n\n### How these mechanisms interact:\n- Absolute monetary payoff always positively contributes to utility.\n- Responders may tolerate some level of unfairness without penalty.\n- Beyond an internalized threshold, responders experience discrete negative mental cost or disutility, causing their utility to decrease sharply if the unfairness exceeds this \"fairness tolerance\".\n- This threshold could be defined behaviorally as a specific percentage below their proportional contribution.\n\n### What mathematical form could capture these interactions:\nA threshold model could be analytically represented using an indicator function conditioned on the violation of a fairness threshold based on proportional fairness. Utility would depend linearly positively on monetary outcome, combined with a discrete penalty if unfairness goes beyond the tolerated threshold.\n\n### What parameters would be needed to calibrate the model:\nWe would introduce only two learnable parameters due to constraints:\n\n- Alpha (\u03b1): Linear scaling of absolute monetary payoff.\n- Threshold penalty (theta_penalty): Fixed discrete penalty if unfairness surpasses a psychologically rooted tolerance threshold.\n\nTo fix the threshold clearly from the data without introducing another parameter (to keep learned parameters at 2), we can set the threshold at a specific psychologically-reasonable cutoff. For instance, we can set the threshold at a 10% proportional fairness violation threshold; thus, it is not a parameter, but a predetermined psychological assumption of tolerance.\n\n### How the model variables map to observable behavior:\n- split_self: directly maps to monetary gains (positive utility).\n- token_self and token_opp: used to calculate proportional fairness; deviation from fairness >10% maps discretely to negative utility.\n\nGiven the previous explorations, this simple and psychologically-grounded threshold model is fundamentally different, non-linear, intuitive, and may effectively capture a different underlying psychological strategy responders might adopt, particularly participants who exhibit clear \"threshold\" thinking rather than smooth penalization.\n\nNow formally state the model clearly:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * split_self - theta_penalty * I(((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) - (splitperc_self / 100)) > 0.10)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of the responder for a proposed offer\",\n      \"range\": { \n        \"min\": \"-inf\", \n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility scaling for absolute monetary payoffs received by responder\",\n      \"range\": { \n        \"min\": 0, \n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"theta_penalty\": {\n      \"description\": \"Discrete utility penalty if fairness violation exceeds 10% deviation below expected proportional fairness\",\n      \"range\": { \n        \"min\": 0, \n        \"max\": 50,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed monetary share for the responder\",\n      \"range\": { \n        \"min\": 0, \n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"splitperc_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Offered percentage share of combined earning to the responder\",\n      \"range\": { \n        \"min\": 0, \n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Tokens initially found by the responder, measure of contribution\",\n      \"range\": { \n         \"min\": 0, \n         \"max\": \"inf\",\n         \"inclusive_min\": true,\n         \"inclusive_max\": false\n       },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Tokens initially found by the opponent, contribution reference\",\n      \"range\": { \n        \"min\": 0, \n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"I(((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) - (splitperc_self / 100)) > 0.10)\": {\n      \"description\": \"Indicator function that equals 1 if the responder receives at least 10% less than proportional fairness based on token contributions, else 0.\",\n      \"range\": { \n        \"min\": 0, \n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA threshold-based fairness penalty model combining absolute monetary payoff (scaled by alpha) with a discrete fairness penalty (theta_penalty) triggered only if the responder receives an offer at least 10% worse than their proportional contribution.

For instance, we can set the threshold at a 10% proportional fairness violation threshold; thus, it is not a parameter, but a predetermined psychological assumption of tolerance.\n\n### How the model variables map to observable behavior:\n- split_self: directly maps to monetary gains (positive utility).\n- token_self and token_opp: used to calculate proportional fairness; deviation from fairness >10% maps discretely to negative utility.\n\nGiven the previous explorations, this simple and psychologically-grounded threshold model is fundamentally different, non-linear, intuitive, and may effectively capture a different underlying psychological strategy responders might adopt, particularly participants who exhibit clear \"threshold\" thinking rather than smooth penalization.\n\nNow formally state the model clearly:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * split_self - theta_penalty * I(((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) - (splitperc_self / 100)) > 0.10)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of the responder for a proposed offer\",\n      \"range\": { \n        \"min\": \"-inf\", \n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility scaling for absolute monetary payoffs received by responder\",\n      \"range\": { \n        \"min\": 0, \n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"theta_penalty\": {\n      \"description\": \"Discrete utility penalty if fairness violation exceeds 10% deviation below expected proportional fairness\",\n      \"range\": { \n        \"min\": 0, \n        \"max\": 50,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed monetary share for the responder\",\n      \"range\": { \n        \"min\": 0, \n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"splitperc_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Offered percentage share of combined earning to the responder\",\n      \"range\": { \n        \"min\": 0, \n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Tokens initially found by the responder, measure of contribution\",\n      \"range\": { \n         \"min\": 0, \n         \"max\": \"inf\",\n         \"inclusive_min\": true,\n         \"inclusive_max\": false\n       },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Tokens initially found by the opponent, contribution reference\",\n      \"range\": { \n        \"min\": 0, \n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"I(((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) - (splitperc_self / 100)) > 0.10)\": {\n      \"description\": \"Indicator function that equals 1 if the responder receives at least 10% less than proportional fairness based on token contributions, else 0.\",\n      \"range\": { \n        \"min\": 0, \n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA threshold-based fairness penalty model combining absolute monetary payoff (scaled by alpha) with a discrete fairness penalty (theta_penalty) triggered only if the responder receives an offer at least 10% worse than their proportional contribution.
