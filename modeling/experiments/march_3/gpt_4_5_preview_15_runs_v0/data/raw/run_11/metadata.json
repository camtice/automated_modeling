Specifically, utility decreases if the absolute payoff received falls below the participant's original token-based contribution (valued at \u00a33 per token).

      "output": "Let me think through this step by step...\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Key Psychological Mechanisms Involved**:\n   - Responders likely assess the fairness of an offer relative to their contribution of tokens.\n   - Responders might be sensitive to their payoff being below or above their proportional entitlement derived from their relative number of tokens found.\n   - Previous models have explored simple proportional fairness (linear), heuristic (fixed 50%), absolute monetary inequity, dominance conditions, threshold conditions and proportional expectation discrepancy.\n   - Another possible psychological mechanism not yet explicitly tested is **relative proportional discrepancy**: participants might not just care linearly about absolute unfairness, but rather about unfairness proportionate to their deserved share. For instance, a 10-pound shortfall might feel different if they're entitled to 20 pounds (50% discrepancy) compared to if they're entitled to 100 pounds (10% discrepancy). Thus participants may psychologically respond strongly to relative gaps from proportional fairness.\n\n2. **How these mechanisms interact**:\n   - Responders gain positive utility from their received monetary payoff (`split_self`).\n   - Responders experience negative utility when their monetary payoff is systematically smaller as a proportion of what they \"deserve\" based on their own tokens relative to total tokens.\n\n3. **Mathematical form that captures interactions**:\n   - Positive utility from monetary payoff: linear in monetary payoff (`split_self`) scaled by a parameter `alpha`.\n   - Negative utility from \"relative proportional unfairness\": calculated by `(expected amount based on proportional contribution - actual received amount) / expected amount`, scaled by another learnable parameter (`rel_prop_unfairness_weight`). Negative utility applies only if the received amount is smaller than proportional expectation; else the unfairness term is zero.\n\n   Mathematical formulation of \"relative proportional unfairness\" is thus expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\max\\left(\\frac{\\text{token_self}}{\\text{token_self + token_opp}} \\times \\text{combined_earning} - \\text{split_self}, 0\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{\\text{token_self}}{\\text{token_self + token_opp}} \\times \\text{combined_earning}\\right)}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Parameters needed**:\n   - `alpha`: represents the absolute valuation of the monetary payoff.\n   - `rel_prop_unfairness_weight`: represents the penalty sensitivity for the relative proportional shortfall.\n   - Two parameters total.\n\n5. **High covariance between parameters**:\n   - There's a clear interpretative and mathematical separation here. \"alpha\" governs absolute utility from payoff. The second parameter governs relative proportional unfairness. Both constructs should be reasonably distinct and interpretable, minimizing covariance problems.\n\n6. **Mapping variables to observable behavior**:\n   - Increased utility positively relates to acceptance likelihood.\n   - Relative unfairness causes utility decrement, thus reducing likelihood of acceptance.\n\nNow I present formally:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * split_self - rel_prop_unfairness_weight * (max(((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning - split_self), 0) / ((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposed share\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Linear utility weight for monetary payoff received\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"rel_prop_unfairness_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Penalty weight for the relative proportional shortfall from proportional entitlement (ratio-based)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 50,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The absolute monetary amount proposed to the participant (\u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money earned by both participant and opponent (\u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model combining absolute monetary self-interest utility (scaled by alpha) with a relative proportional unfairness penalty.

Negative utility applies only if the received amount is smaller than proportional expectation; else the unfairness term is zero.\n\n   Mathematical formulation of \"relative proportional unfairness\" is thus expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\max\\left(\\frac{\\text{token_self}}{\\text{token_self + token_opp}} \\times \\text{combined_earning} - \\text{split_self}, 0\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{\\text{token_self}}{\\text{token_self + token_opp}} \\times \\text{combined_earning}\\right)}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Parameters needed**:\n   - `alpha`: represents the absolute valuation of the monetary payoff.\n   - `rel_prop_unfairness_weight`: represents the penalty sensitivity for the relative proportional shortfall.\n   - Two parameters total.\n\n5. **High covariance between parameters**:\n   - There's a clear interpretative and mathematical separation here. \"alpha\" governs absolute utility from payoff. The second parameter governs relative proportional unfairness. Both constructs should be reasonably distinct and interpretable, minimizing covariance problems.\n\n6. **Mapping variables to observable behavior**:\n   - Increased utility positively relates to acceptance likelihood.\n   - Relative unfairness causes utility decrement, thus reducing likelihood of acceptance.\n\nNow I present formally:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * split_self - rel_prop_unfairness_weight * (max(((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning - split_self), 0) / ((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the proposed share\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Linear utility weight for monetary payoff received\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"rel_prop_unfairness_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Penalty weight for the relative proportional shortfall from proportional entitlement (ratio-based)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 50,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The absolute monetary amount proposed to the participant (\u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money earned by both participant and opponent (\u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model combining absolute monetary self-interest utility (scaled by alpha) with a relative proportional unfairness penalty.

This unfairness penalty is proportional to the relative shortfall from the responder's expected proportional entitlement based on tokens contributed. Participants experience reduced utility if the amount received falls below their fair share, with the reduction scaled by a learnable penalty parameter (rel_prop_unfairness_weight).\nBIC: 31.446116784861577\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.890\n- rel_prop_unfairness_weight: r = 0.875"
