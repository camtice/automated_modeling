Participants gain proportional utility from the absolute monetary offer (weighted by \"alpha\"), and incur negative utility proportional to disadvantageous inequity (weighted by \"beta_inequity\"). The inequity component penalizes offers lower than proportional fairness based on tokens contributed.\nBIC: 32.313398129961634\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.816\n- beta_inequity: r = 0.746\nModel 2:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - beta_adv_inequity * max((splitperc_self / 100) - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)), 0)\nSummary: A linear utility model combining absolute monetary self-interest utility with a penalty for advantageous inequity. Participants gain positive utility proportional to the received monetary amount (scaled by alpha), and experience a utility decrement if receiving more than their proportional share based on their relative token contribution (scaled by beta_adv_inequity).\nBIC: 45.57939973827636\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.796\n- beta_adv_inequity: r = 0.074\nModel 3:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - beta_equity * abs((splitperc_self / 100) - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)))\nSummary: A linear utility model combining self-interest (monetary payoff to self, scaled by alpha) and general fairness sensitivity (scaled by beta_equity). The fairness component penalizes any deviation (both advantageous and disadvantageous inequities equally) from the participant's proportional contribution to the group pot. This captures absolute self-interest and fairness motivations with two learnable parameters.\nBIC: 33.78274620257657\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.755\n- beta_equity: r = 0.485\nModel 4:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - gamma * abs(splitperc_self - 50)\nSummary: A heuristic fairness utility model combining absolute monetary payoffs (scaled by alpha) with a penalty for deviations from an equal 50%-50% outcome (scaled by gamma). The model explicitly tests whether responders utilize a fixed intrinsic fairness heuristic, penalizing any departure away from perfect equality independently of individual token contributions.\nBIC: 33.27089971692903\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.479\n- gamma: r = 0.733\nModel 5:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - delta_loss * max((3 * token_self - split_self), 0)\nSummary: A linear utility model capturing responder utility with two distinct psychological components: absolute monetary self-interest benefit (scaled by alpha), and a fairness-related penalty if the offer does not match the participant's actual absolute contribution to the shared pot, scaled by delta_loss. Specifically, utility decreases if the absolute payoff received falls below the participant's original token-based contribution (valued at \u00a33 per token). This model explicitly emphasizes absolute \"ownership\" fairness rather than proportional or heuristic equity.\nBIC: 31.02825541230998\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.812\n- delta_loss: r = 0.854\nModel 6:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - opponent_dominance_penalty * I(split_opp > split_self)\nSummary: A linear utility model combining absolute monetary payoffs received by the responder (scaled by alpha) and a distinct binary penalty for situations where responders receive strictly less absolute money than their opponents (scaled by opponent_dominance_penalty). The model explicitly tests sensitivity to absolute opponent-dominance independently from the participants' proportional token contributions.\nBIC: 35.093547975736996\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.680\n- opponent_dominance_penalty: r = 0.811\nModel 7:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - beta_mon_disadv * max(split_opp - split_self, 0)\nSummary: A linear utility model for responder behavior combining absolute monetary self-interest (\"alpha\") and linear sensitivity to disadvantageous monetary outcomes (\"beta_mon_disadv\"). The model explicitly penalizes absolute monetary disadvantage, when responders receive strictly less money than their opponents, independently of proportionality or absolute contributions.\nBIC: 31.381471598971157\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.848\n- beta_mon_disadv: r = 0.848\nModel 8:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self + beta_advantageous_mon_dominance * I(split_self > split_opp)\nSummary: A linear additive utility model combining absolute self-interested monetary payoffs (scaled by alpha) with a discrete boost in utility derived from advantageous monetary dominance\u2014receiving strictly more money than one's opponent (scaled by beta_advantageous_mon_dominance). This captures both absolute payoff utility and psychological reward for \"winning,\" independent of proportionality or fairness of the monetary split.\nBIC: 45.609034860667876\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.829\n- beta_advantageous_mon_dominance: r = -0.032\nModel 9:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - expectation_penalty * max(((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning - split_self), 0)\nSummary: A linear expectation-based utility model combining absolute monetary payoff (scaled by alpha) with a linear penalty for receiving less monetary payoff than expected based on proportional token contributions (scaled by expectation_penalty). This explicitly models responder sensitivity to violations of proportional expectation-based fairness.\nBIC: 30.756923372005172\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.788\n- expectation_penalty: r = 0.859\nModel 10:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - theta_penalty * I(((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) - (splitperc_self / 100)) > 0.10)\nSummary: A threshold-based fairness penalty model combining absolute monetary payoff (scaled by alpha) with a discrete fairness penalty (theta_penalty) triggered only if the responder receives an offer at least 10% worse than their proportional contribution. This model explicitly tests whether responders possess a tolerance threshold for unfairness rather than a strictly linear fairness sensitivity.\nBIC: 33.89427359734884\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.809\n- theta_penalty: r = 0.832\nModel 11:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - rel_prop_unfairness_weight * (max(((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning - split_self), 0) / ((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning))\nSummary: A utility model combining absolute monetary self-interest utility (scaled by alpha) with a relative proportional unfairness penalty. This unfairness penalty is proportional to the relative shortfall from the responder's expected proportional entitlement based on tokens contributed. Participants experience reduced utility if the amount received falls below their fair share, with the reduction scaled by a learnable penalty parameter (rel_prop_unfairness_weight).\nBIC: 31.446116784861577\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.890\n- rel_prop_unfairness_weight: r = 0.875\nModel 12:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - beta_envy * split_opp\nSummary: A linear utility model capturing responder behavior determined by absolute monetary self-interest and opponent envy. Participants gain utility proportional to their own monetary payoffs (scaled by alpha) and experience negative utility directly proportional to absolute monetary payoffs awarded to their opponent (scaled by beta_envy). This explicitly tests whether responders systematically penalize high absolute opponent payoffs independently of proportional fairness or equality.\nBIC: 31.384325134632306\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.753\n- beta_envy: r = 0.785\nModel 13:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - beta_effortLoss * max(1 - (split_self / (3 * token_self)), 0)\nSummary: A linear absolute-effort-fairness model predicting responder utility from the absolute monetary payoff received scaled by alpha, combined with a penalty (beta_effortLoss) applied to offers falling below the responder's absolute \"effort expectation\". Effort expectation is defined explicitly as the monetary value of the responder's token contribution (each token valued at \u00a33). Responders linearly penalize offers paying strictly below their individual absolute effort contributed (ratio < 1).\nBIC: 31.91872336347605\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.768\n- beta_effortLoss: r = 0.693\nModel 14:\nSpecification: U = beta_proportional * splitperc_self\nSummary: A minimalist proportional-heuristic utility model of responder behavior assuming utility is influenced only by the percentage share of the total pot offered. The single learnable parameter (beta_proportional) scales how strongly percentage shares directly drive acceptance decisions. This explicitly tests proportional heuristic-driven acceptance independently of fairness defined by tokens, absolute payoff, or opponent outcomes.\nBIC: 195.80027913206703\nParameter Recovery:\n- beta_proportional: r = 0.271",

If there are no previous models, start with one learnable parameter, then ensure the space of possible models is thoroughly explored with one parameter before moving to two parameters, etc.\n\nYour results will be scored on a combination of BIC with a penalization for number of learned parameters, the ability to recover those learned parameters, and the ability of those parameters to account for the differences in behaviors among varying groups of people.\n\nPrevious Models:\nModel 1:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - beta_inequity * max((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) - (splitperc_self / 100), 0)\nSummary: A linear utility model capturing responder behavior based on absolute self-interest and disadvantageous inequity aversion. Participants gain proportional utility from the absolute monetary offer (weighted by \"alpha\"), and incur negative utility proportional to disadvantageous inequity (weighted by \"beta_inequity\"). The inequity component penalizes offers lower than proportional fairness based on tokens contributed.\nBIC: 32.313398129961634\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.816\n- beta_inequity: r = 0.746\nModel 2:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - beta_adv_inequity * max((splitperc_self / 100) - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)), 0)\nSummary: A linear utility model combining absolute monetary self-interest utility with a penalty for advantageous inequity. Participants gain positive utility proportional to the received monetary amount (scaled by alpha), and experience a utility decrement if receiving more than their proportional share based on their relative token contribution (scaled by beta_adv_inequity).\nBIC: 45.57939973827636\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.796\n- beta_adv_inequity: r = 0.074\nModel 3:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - beta_equity * abs((splitperc_self / 100) - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)))\nSummary: A linear utility model combining self-interest (monetary payoff to self, scaled by alpha) and general fairness sensitivity (scaled by beta_equity). The fairness component penalizes any deviation (both advantageous and disadvantageous inequities equally) from the participant's proportional contribution to the group pot. This captures absolute self-interest and fairness motivations with two learnable parameters.\nBIC: 33.78274620257657\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.755\n- beta_equity: r = 0.485\nModel 4:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - gamma * abs(splitperc_self - 50)\nSummary: A heuristic fairness utility model combining absolute monetary payoffs (scaled by alpha) with a penalty for deviations from an equal 50%-50% outcome (scaled by gamma). The model explicitly tests whether responders utilize a fixed intrinsic fairness heuristic, penalizing any departure away from perfect equality independently of individual token contributions.\nBIC: 33.27089971692903\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.479\n- gamma: r = 0.733\nModel 5:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - delta_loss * max((3 * token_self - split_self), 0)\nSummary: A linear utility model capturing responder utility with two distinct psychological components: absolute monetary self-interest benefit (scaled by alpha), and a fairness-related penalty if the offer does not match the participant's actual absolute contribution to the shared pot, scaled by delta_loss. Specifically, utility decreases if the absolute payoff received falls below the participant's original token-based contribution (valued at \u00a33 per token). This model explicitly emphasizes absolute \"ownership\" fairness rather than proportional or heuristic equity.\nBIC: 31.02825541230998\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.812\n- delta_loss: r = 0.854\nModel 6:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - opponent_dominance_penalty * I(split_opp > split_self)\nSummary: A linear utility model combining absolute monetary payoffs received by the responder (scaled by alpha) and a distinct binary penalty for situations where responders receive strictly less absolute money than their opponents (scaled by opponent_dominance_penalty). The model explicitly tests sensitivity to absolute opponent-dominance independently from the participants' proportional token contributions.\nBIC: 35.093547975736996\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.680\n- opponent_dominance_penalty: r = 0.811\nModel 7:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - beta_mon_disadv * max(split_opp - split_self, 0)\nSummary: A linear utility model for responder behavior combining absolute monetary self-interest (\"alpha\") and linear sensitivity to disadvantageous monetary outcomes (\"beta_mon_disadv\"). The model explicitly penalizes absolute monetary disadvantage, when responders receive strictly less money than their opponents, independently of proportionality or absolute contributions.\nBIC: 31.381471598971157\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.848\n- beta_mon_disadv: r = 0.848\nModel 8:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self + beta_advantageous_mon_dominance * I(split_self > split_opp)\nSummary: A linear additive utility model combining absolute self-interested monetary payoffs (scaled by alpha) with a discrete boost in utility derived from advantageous monetary dominance\u2014receiving strictly more money than one's opponent (scaled by beta_advantageous_mon_dominance). This captures both absolute payoff utility and psychological reward for \"winning,\" independent of proportionality or fairness of the monetary split.\nBIC: 45.609034860667876\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.829\n- beta_advantageous_mon_dominance: r = -0.032\nModel 9:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - expectation_penalty * max(((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning - split_self), 0)\nSummary: A linear expectation-based utility model combining absolute monetary payoff (scaled by alpha) with a linear penalty for receiving less monetary payoff than expected based on proportional token contributions (scaled by expectation_penalty). This explicitly models responder sensitivity to violations of proportional expectation-based fairness.\nBIC: 30.756923372005172\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.788\n- expectation_penalty: r = 0.859\nModel 10:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - theta_penalty * I(((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) - (splitperc_self / 100)) > 0.10)\nSummary: A threshold-based fairness penalty model combining absolute monetary payoff (scaled by alpha) with a discrete fairness penalty (theta_penalty) triggered only if the responder receives an offer at least 10% worse than their proportional contribution. This model explicitly tests whether responders possess a tolerance threshold for unfairness rather than a strictly linear fairness sensitivity.\nBIC: 33.89427359734884\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.809\n- theta_penalty: r = 0.832\nModel 11:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - rel_prop_unfairness_weight * (max(((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning - split_self), 0) / ((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning))\nSummary: A utility model combining absolute monetary self-interest utility (scaled by alpha) with a relative proportional unfairness penalty. This unfairness penalty is proportional to the relative shortfall from the responder's expected proportional entitlement based on tokens contributed. Participants experience reduced utility if the amount received falls below their fair share, with the reduction scaled by a learnable penalty parameter (rel_prop_unfairness_weight).\nBIC: 31.446116784861577\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.890\n- rel_prop_unfairness_weight: r = 0.875\nModel 12:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - beta_envy * split_opp\nSummary: A linear utility model capturing responder behavior determined by absolute monetary self-interest and opponent envy. Participants gain utility proportional to their own monetary payoffs (scaled by alpha) and experience negative utility directly proportional to absolute monetary payoffs awarded to their opponent (scaled by beta_envy). This explicitly tests whether responders systematically penalize high absolute opponent payoffs independently of proportional fairness or equality.\nBIC: 31.384325134632306\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.753\n- beta_envy: r = 0.785\nModel 13:\nSpecification: U = alpha * split_self - beta_effortLoss * max(1 - (split_self / (3 * token_self)), 0)\nSummary: A linear absolute-effort-fairness model predicting responder utility from the absolute monetary payoff received scaled by alpha, combined with a penalty (beta_effortLoss) applied to offers falling below the responder's absolute \"effort expectation\". Effort expectation is defined explicitly as the monetary value of the responder's token contribution (each token valued at \u00a33). Responders linearly penalize offers paying strictly below their individual absolute effort contributed (ratio < 1).\nBIC: 31.91872336347605\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.768\n- beta_effortLoss: r = 0.693\nModel 14:\nSpecification: U = beta_proportional * splitperc_self\nSummary: A minimalist proportional-heuristic utility model of responder behavior assuming utility is influenced only by the percentage share of the total pot offered. The single learnable parameter (beta_proportional) scales how strongly percentage shares directly drive acceptance decisions. This explicitly tests proportional heuristic-driven acceptance independently of fairness defined by tokens, absolute payoff, or opponent outcomes.\nBIC: 195.80027913206703\nParameter Recovery:\n- beta_proportional: r = 0.271\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions.",
      "output": "Let me think through this step by step:\n\nStep 1: Key psychological mechanisms involved  \nParticipants acting as responders likely consider their absolute monetary gains as a primary determinant of utility. Additionally, responders may show diminished incremental utility from additional monetary gains (\"diminishing marginal returns\"), a fundamental and well-known psychological and economic principle (concave utility function).\n\nStep 2: How these mechanisms interact  \nWhile previous models primarily utilized linear relationships (where each additional pound held equal value), adding a nonlinear concave function allows us to explicitly capture diminishing marginal utility for monetary outcomes. Here, each additional unit of monetary payoff offers less incremental psychological satisfaction.\n\nStep 3: Mathematical form that captures these interactions clearly  \nDiminishing marginal returns can be well represented by a concave function (e.g., power function or log function). Log functions explicitly enforce diminishing marginal returns elegantly: ln(split_self + c), where \"c\" ensures we don't take the log of zero.\n\nStep 4: Parameters needed to calibrate the model clearly and to avoid high covariance  \nWe will have two learnable parameters:  \n- alpha (weight parameter scaling the monetary payoff in log form)  \n- c (shift constant to avoid log(0), learnable to adjust curvature)\n\nA two-parameter log function capturing diminishing returns should be independently recoverable, provided we give parameters clear differentiable functions (scaling vs shifting behaviour).\n\nStep 5: How observable behavior maps clearly  \nHigher responder utilities explicitly correspond to higher subjective utility, increasing likelihood of acceptance (handled externally by separate temperature/noise parameter).

Log functions explicitly enforce diminishing marginal returns elegantly: ln(split_self + c), where \"c\" ensures we don't take the log of zero.\n\nStep 4: Parameters needed to calibrate the model clearly and to avoid high covariance  \nWe will have two learnable parameters:  \n- alpha (weight parameter scaling the monetary payoff in log form)  \n- c (shift constant to avoid log(0), learnable to adjust curvature)\n\nA two-parameter log function capturing diminishing returns should be independently recoverable, provided we give parameters clear differentiable functions (scaling vs shifting behaviour).\n\nStep 5: How observable behavior maps clearly  \nHigher responder utilities explicitly correspond to higher subjective utility, increasing likelihood of acceptance (handled externally by separate temperature/noise parameter). Offers increasing absolutely yield diminishing increments in utility. \n\nGiven we are only predicting responder behavior here, this clearly maps responders seeking maximal achievable utility given offered splits.\n\n<Model Justification>:  \nTwo-parameter log-utility model explicitly adds the psychological realism of diminishing marginal returns to money, a well-supported principle not yet captured clearly in prior tested models.\n\nThus, the formal mathematical formulation is:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * ln(split_self + c)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offered monetary amount.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight parameter scaling the marginal utility obtained from log monetary payoffs received, representing sensitivity to monetary outcomes under diminishing returns.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.001,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Absolute monetary payoff offered to the responder (\u00a3).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"c\": {\n      \"description\": \"Shift constant added inside the log function to avoid log(0) and ensure stable diminishing returns curvature adjustment.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.001,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model incorporating diminishing marginal returns on absolute monetary payoffs using a logarithmic function.

The learnable parameters include alpha (a scaling parameter determining the strength of marginal utility from monetary payoff) and c (a shift parameter inside the log function ensuring numerical stability and flexible curvature). This model explicitly tests diminishing returns psychology in responder behavior independently of fairness or proportionality concerns.\nBIC: 45.460669658811554\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.693\n- c: r = 0.100"
