      "output": "Let me first reason step by step about the computational model:\n\n### Key Psychological Mechanisms:\n\n1. **Self-interest (Greed Utility)**: Participants likely respond positively to greater amounts of absolute monetary gains.\n2. **Contribution-proportional Social Norms (Deservingness Utility)**: People might consider it fairer to receive shares of the payoff that closely reflect the relative contributions (tokens earned by participant relative to opponent).\n3. **Advantageous Inequity**: Beyond just penalizing disadvantageous inequity (already tested), participants might also experience discomfort when receiving more than their \"fair share,\" thus expressing advantageous inequity aversion.\n\n### How These Mechanisms Interact:\n\nModel 1 already explored disadvantageous inequity (being worse off than one's relative contribution). A natural next step is to test advantageous inequity\u2014receiving more than one's fair share relative to contributions. Thus, utility would result from self-interest and a penalty component applied when the participant receives more than their proportional share\u2014capturing advantageous inequity aversion.\n\n### Mathematical form:\n\nTo capture advantageous inequity explicitly, let's define the \"fair proportion\" as the proportion of tokens self-earned relative to the total earning, and penalize situations where the received proportion exceeds this fair proportion. This can be represented by a piecewise-linear inequity penalty term, triggered only if the share received exceeds the \"fair\" proportion.\n\nA suitable mathematical formulation could be:\n\nDefinitions:\n\n- Fair proportion (fair_share) = token_self / (token_self + token_opp)\n- Advantageous inequity occurs if (splitperc_self/100) > fair_share\n\nThen, the model could be represented as:\n\n\\[\nU = \\alpha \\cdot split\\_self - \\beta\\_adv\\_inequity \\cdot \\max\\left(\\frac{splitperc\\_self}{100} - \\frac{token\\_self}{token\\_self+token\\_opp},\\:0\\right)\n\\]\n\nIn this model, \u03b1 captures pure monetary self-interest (linear), while \u03b2_adv_inequity penalizes advantageous inequity proportionate to how much the received proportion deviates positively from the fair contribution proportion.\n\n### Parameters needed:\n\nThis model requires two parameters:\n\n1. **alpha (\u03b1)**: captures sensitivity to absolute monetary gain.\n2. **beta_adv_inequity (\u03b2_adv_inequity)**: advantageous inequity aversion parameter (penalty magnitude for getting more than the perceived fair share).\n\nThese parameters map directly to observable behavior: as alpha grows, acceptance becomes more likely purely based on monetary incentives; as \u03b2_adv_inequity grows, responders become more sensitive to fairness violations benefiting themselves, suggesting some responders might accept less advantageously inequitable outcomes.\n\nNow, let's formally specify the model:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * split_self - beta_adv_inequity * max((splitperc_self / 100) - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)), 0)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting an offered split\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Monetary self-interest parameter, scaling utility from self-directed monetary amount\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 10.0,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta_adv_inequity\": {\n      \"description\": \"Advantageous inequity aversion parameter, penalizing utility proportionately if participant receives more than a contribution-based fair share\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 10.0,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The monetary amount (in \u00a3) proposed for the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"splitperc_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Percentage of total earnings allocated to participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens contributed by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens contributed by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA linear utility model combining absolute monetary self-interest utility with a penalty for advantageous inequity.

Participants gain positive utility proportional to the received monetary amount (scaled by alpha), and experience a utility decrement if receiving more than their proportional share based on their relative token contribution (scaled by beta_adv_inequity).",
  "full_reasoning": "Let me first reason step by step about the computational model:\n\n### Key Psychological Mechanisms:\n\n1. **Self-interest (Greed Utility)**: Participants likely respond positively to greater amounts of absolute monetary gains.\n2. **Contribution-proportional Social Norms (Deservingness Utility)**: People might consider it fairer to receive shares of the payoff that closely reflect the relative contributions (tokens earned by participant relative to opponent).\n3. **Advantageous Inequity**: Beyond just penalizing disadvantageous inequity (already tested), participants might also experience discomfort when receiving more than their \"fair share,\" thus expressing advantageous inequity aversion.\n\n### How These Mechanisms Interact:\n\nModel 1 already explored disadvantageous inequity (being worse off than one's relative contribution). A natural next step is to test advantageous inequity\u2014receiving more than one's fair share relative to contributions. Thus, utility would result from self-interest and a penalty component applied when the participant receives more than their proportional share\u2014capturing advantageous inequity aversion.\n\n### Mathematical form:\n\nTo capture advantageous inequity explicitly, let's define the \"fair proportion\" as the proportion of tokens self-earned relative to the total earning, and penalize situations where the received proportion exceeds this fair proportion. This can be represented by a piecewise-linear inequity penalty term, triggered only if the share received exceeds the \"fair\" proportion.\n\nA suitable mathematical formulation could be:\n\nDefinitions:\n\n- Fair proportion (fair_share) = token_self / (token_self + token_opp)\n- Advantageous inequity occurs if (splitperc_self/100) > fair_share\n\nThen, the model could be represented as:\n\n\\[\nU = \\alpha \\cdot split\\_self - \\beta\\_adv\\_inequity \\cdot \\max\\left(\\frac{splitperc\\_self}{100} - \\frac{token\\_self}{token\\_self+token\\_opp},\\:0\\right)\n\\]\n\nIn this model, \u03b1 captures pure monetary self-interest (linear), while \u03b2_adv_inequity penalizes advantageous inequity proportionate to how much the received proportion deviates positively from the fair contribution proportion.\n\n### Parameters needed:\n\nThis model requires two parameters:\n\n1. **alpha (\u03b1)**: captures sensitivity to absolute monetary gain.\n2. **beta_adv_inequity (\u03b2_adv_inequity)**: advantageous inequity aversion parameter (penalty magnitude for getting more than the perceived fair share).\n\nThese parameters map directly to observable behavior: as alpha grows, acceptance becomes more likely purely based on monetary incentives; as \u03b2_adv_inequity grows, responders become more sensitive to fairness violations benefiting themselves, suggesting some responders might accept less advantageously inequitable outcomes.\n\nNow, let's formally specify the model:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * split_self - beta_adv_inequity * max((splitperc_self / 100) - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)), 0)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting an offered split\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Monetary self-interest parameter, scaling utility from self-directed monetary amount\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 10.0,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta_adv_inequity\": {\n      \"description\": \"Advantageous inequity aversion parameter, penalizing utility proportionately if participant receives more than a contribution-based fair share\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 10.0,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The monetary amount (in \u00a3) proposed for the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"splitperc_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Percentage of total earnings allocated to participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens contributed by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens contributed by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA linear utility model combining absolute monetary self-interest utility with a penalty for advantageous inequity.
