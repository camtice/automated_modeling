      "output": "First, let's reason carefully step by step.\n\nStep 1: Key psychological mechanisms involved  \nGiven the context of the task:  \n- Participants act as respondents to monetary split proposals.\n- Individuals care about absolute outcomes (money to self) and fairness.\n- We already have models assessing disadvantageous and advantageous inequity separately, but not combined into a single model.\n- The relative contribution (tokens found by self vs. opponent) matters since fairness perception depends on relative input and outcome distributions.\n- Individuals might penalize both disadvantageous (receiving less than proportional fair share) and advantageous inequity (receiving more than proportional fair share).  \n\nStep 2: Interaction of these mechanisms  \n- A participant's utility likely increases with increased individual monetary share (economic self-interest).\n- Participant utility might decrease when there's disadvantageous inequity (participant receives less than fair amount given contribution ratios).\n- Utility might also decrease proportionally to advantageous inequity (participant receives more than their fair contribution ratio, possibly indicating discomfort with overly favorable inequity).\n\nStep 3: Mathematical form to capture these interactions  \nWe should capture both inequity types in one equation:\n- Utility is linearly increasing with the absolute amount to self (split_self).\n- Utility is reduced by disadvantageous inequity (DI), defined as \"proportional fairness - actual percent to self\", when the participant receives less.\n- Utility is reduced by advantageous inequity (AI), defined as \"actual percent to self - proportional fairness\", when participant receives more.\n\nStep 4: Parameters needed  \nWe need two learnable parameters:  \n- A single monetary self-interest sensitivity parameter (alpha).  \n- A single fairness/inequity aversion parameter (beta_equity) that penalizes both disadvantageous and advantageous inequity equally.  \nThis allows capturing fairness as a balance-seeking psychological mechanism, thus avoiding separate parameters for advantageous and disadvantageous inequities.\n\nStep 5: Mapping model variables to observable data  \nThe utility can directly map onto acceptances: higher predicted utility from an offer increases its probability of acceptance. Negative utilities represent lower likelihoods of acceptance.  \n\nGiven these considerations, the simplest unexplored modeled scenario is one with:  \n- Utility proportional to self-share monetary payoff.\n- Inequity component captures both directions (advantageous and disadvantageous inequity) in one fairness-based equity parameter.\n\nNow defining formally:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * split_self - beta_equity * abs((splitperc_self / 100) - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility for accepting the proposed share for the responder\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Self-interested sensitivity parameter determining how much utility increases per unit of monetary gain received by participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"min\": 0,\n          \"max\": 10\n        }\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Absolute amount of money (\u00a3) proposed to the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"beta_equity\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fairness sensitivity parameter penalizing deviation from proportional fairness in either advantageous or disadvantageous direction\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"min\": 0,\n          \"max\": 20\n        }\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"splitperc_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Percent (%) of the total earning proposed to the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA linear utility model combining self-interest (monetary payoff to self, scaled by alpha) and general fairness sensitivity (scaled by beta_equity).

Negative utilities represent lower likelihoods of acceptance.  \n\nGiven these considerations, the simplest unexplored modeled scenario is one with:  \n- Utility proportional to self-share monetary payoff.\n- Inequity component captures both directions (advantageous and disadvantageous inequity) in one fairness-based equity parameter.\n\nNow defining formally:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * split_self - beta_equity * abs((splitperc_self / 100) - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility for accepting the proposed share for the responder\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Self-interested sensitivity parameter determining how much utility increases per unit of monetary gain received by participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"min\": 0,\n          \"max\": 10\n        }\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Absolute amount of money (\u00a3) proposed to the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"beta_equity\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fairness sensitivity parameter penalizing deviation from proportional fairness in either advantageous or disadvantageous direction\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"min\": 0,\n          \"max\": 20\n        }\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"splitperc_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Percent (%) of the total earning proposed to the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA linear utility model combining self-interest (monetary payoff to self, scaled by alpha) and general fairness sensitivity (scaled by beta_equity).

The fairness component penalizes any deviation (both advantageous and disadvantageous inequities equally) from the participant's proportional contribution to the group pot. This captures absolute self-interest and fairness motivations with two learnable parameters.\nBIC: 33.78274620257657\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.755\n- beta_equity: r = 0.485"
