      "output": "Let's first systematically reason step by step:\n\n## Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### 1. Key psychological mechanisms involved:\nPrevious models have thoroughly explored inequity-aversion (advantageous, disadvantageous, and symmetrical). However, one basic psychological mechanism not yet explicitly tested is that respondents may purely value their relative share of earnings in a more heuristic, simplified manner. That is, participants might not strongly calculate contribution fairness explicitly but instead focus on the percentage outcome itself,\u2014i.e., just their relative percentage (splitperc_self). It may be that responders implicitly have a preferred fixed normative reference point for a 'fair' percentage split independent of token finding effort, potentially influenced by common conventions like 50%-50% splits, and penalize deviations from this intrinsic fairness reference.\n\n### 2. How these mechanisms interact:\nA simpler heuristic mechanism would be:\n- Participants gain positive utility based on their absolute monetary earnings.\n- Participants implicitly penalize splits that deviate from a fixed, intrinsic \"reference\" percentage outcome (could be 50%, a common equity heuristic, independent of explicit effort). Any deviation from that reference percentage yields negative utility.\n\nThus, the interaction naturally results in a trade-off between personal monetary gain (absolute self-interest) and the conceived fairness heuristics in terms of relative splits.\n\n### 3. Mathematical form that could capture these interactions:\nWe propose the utility formalization as follows:\n\n\\[\nU = \\alpha \\text{(absolute monetary gain)} - \\gamma|\\text{actual share percentage} - 50\\%|\n\\]\n\nThis would mean that participants experience psychological discomfort proportional to their deviation from an even (50%) outcome, regardless of their own or others' prior token contributions. Here, we explicitly assume the intrinsic heuristic fairness reference is a simple 50%-50% split.\n\n### 4. Parameters needed to calibrate the model:\nWe require at most two parameters to calibrate this heuristic:\n- \u03b1 (alpha) to scale absolute monetary gains.\n- \u03b3 (gamma) to scale the sensitivity of deviations from the 50%-50% heuristic intrinsic fairness point.\n\n### 5.

  "full_reasoning": "Let's first systematically reason step by step:\n\n## Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### 1. Key psychological mechanisms involved:\nPrevious models have thoroughly explored inequity-aversion (advantageous, disadvantageous, and symmetrical). However, one basic psychological mechanism not yet explicitly tested is that respondents may purely value their relative share of earnings in a more heuristic, simplified manner. That is, participants might not strongly calculate contribution fairness explicitly but instead focus on the percentage outcome itself,\u2014i.e., just their relative percentage (splitperc_self). It may be that responders implicitly have a preferred fixed normative reference point for a 'fair' percentage split independent of token finding effort, potentially influenced by common conventions like 50%-50% splits, and penalize deviations from this intrinsic fairness reference.\n\n### 2. How these mechanisms interact:\nA simpler heuristic mechanism would be:\n- Participants gain positive utility based on their absolute monetary earnings.\n- Participants implicitly penalize splits that deviate from a fixed, intrinsic \"reference\" percentage outcome (could be 50%, a common equity heuristic, independent of explicit effort). Any deviation from that reference percentage yields negative utility.\n\nThus, the interaction naturally results in a trade-off between personal monetary gain (absolute self-interest) and the conceived fairness heuristics in terms of relative splits.\n\n### 3. Mathematical form that could capture these interactions:\nWe propose the utility formalization as follows:\n\n\\[\nU = \\alpha \\text{(absolute monetary gain)} - \\gamma|\\text{actual share percentage} - 50\\%|\n\\]\n\nThis would mean that participants experience psychological discomfort proportional to their deviation from an even (50%) outcome, regardless of their own or others' prior token contributions. Here, we explicitly assume the intrinsic heuristic fairness reference is a simple 50%-50% split.\n\n### 4. Parameters needed to calibrate the model:\nWe require at most two parameters to calibrate this heuristic:\n- \u03b1 (alpha) to scale absolute monetary gains.\n- \u03b3 (gamma) to scale the sensitivity of deviations from the 50%-50% heuristic intrinsic fairness point.\n\n### 5.
