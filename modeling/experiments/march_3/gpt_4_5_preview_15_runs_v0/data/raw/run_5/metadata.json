      "output": "Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n**Key psychological mechanisms involved:**\n- Responders likely consider absolute monetary returns of the offer to themselves (self-interest).\n- Responders may consider relative fairness compared to an opponent's contribution.\n- Responders may base fairness not purely on proportions, but rather on whether the offer matches or surpasses the absolute number of tokens they personally contributed to the group pot (absolute contribution fairness). This mechanism is especially distinct from previously tried mechanisms (proportional fairness or equal split heuristic).\n\n**How these mechanisms interact:**\n- Utility derives positively from receiving money (absolute monetary utility, self-interest).\n- Utility is negatively impacted if the absolute monetary amount to self is lower than the total value of the tokens personally contributed.

Specifically, utility decreases if the absolute payoff received falls below the participant's original token-based contribution (valued at \u00a33 per token). This model explicitly emphasizes absolute \"ownership\" fairness rather than proportional or heuristic equity.\nBIC: 31.02825541230998\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.812\n- delta_loss: r = 0.854"
