      "output": "Step by step reasoning:\n\nKey psychological mechanisms involved:\n- Responders may assess the fairness of proposals based not only on their absolute payoffs, but also by how much they are receiving relative to their own contribution and/or the opponent's contribution.\n- Responses could be driven strongly by absolute outcomes (\"how much money do I get?\"), by relative equity (\"Am I receiving a proportional share?\"), or by a social heuristic related to the perception of being dominated or advantaged by the opponent's contribution.\n- Previous models already tested include disadvantageous inequity (model 1), advantageous inequity (model 2), combined inequity aversion (model 3), equal split heuristic (model 4), and absolute ownership fairness (model 5).  \n- One fundamental and different psychological mechanism not yet explicitly explored is the possibility that responders specifically penalize the situation when the opponent's absolute reward exceeds theirs (opponent-dominance aversion), separately from own absolute payoff. Such behavior presupposes a natural aversion toward a state where the responder is paid less than the opponent in absolute monetary terms, regardless of the proportion of contributions. \n\nHow these mechanisms interact:\n- Utility could reflect a combination of absolute self-interest and a penalty specifically triggered by the opponent receiving explicitly more monetary payoff. Participants likely respond negatively when faced with a situation where the opponent dominates in absolute financial terms, independent from the proportional fairness of dividing tokens.\n- Such opponent-dominance aversion could be represented simply as a binary condition, triggered whenever the opponent's monetary payoff strictly exceeds participant's payoff.\n- This dominance penalty operates separate from absolute gain, and penalizes any situation in which responders are monetarily inferior.\n\nMathematical form (candidate for clarity and simplicity):\n- A linear function of absolute monetary payoff that includes a penalty term triggered if and only if the opponent receives a strictly higher payoff than the participant.\n\nParameters needed:\n- A self-interest parameter capturing sensitivity to absolute monetary payoff (alpha).\n- An opponent-dominance aversion parameter capturing sensitivity to receiving less than the opponent in absolute payoff terms (opponent_dominance_penalty).\n\nSuitability of number and interpretability of parameters:\n- This model incorporates only two learnable parameters clearly differentiable in psychological interpretation.
