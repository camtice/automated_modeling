      "output": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Key Psychological Mechanisms\nPreviously explored models accounted significantly for inequity aversion (advantageous and disadvantageous), equal splits fairness, absolute contributions, and absolute dominance-driven penalties. One possible psychological mechanism not thoroughly tested yet is \"relative advantage sensitivity,\" specifically whether responders consider their relative advantage or disadvantage compared to the opponent in strictly monetary terms, rather than proportional or absolute terms. Prior models penalized proportional differences or absolute dominance but did not explicitly measure monetary advantage or disadvantage strictly as the difference in \u00a3 received.\n\n### Step 2: Interaction of Mechanisms\nThe participant utility would be based on two main effects:\n- Absolute money gain (self-interest) scaled by a parameter.\n- A penalty proportional to the absolute monetary difference between the responder's payoff and the opponent\u2019s payoff, if responder gets less. This explicitly measures sensitivity to \"monetary disadvantage\" explicitly and linearly, differentiating clearly from previous proportional or absolute dominance mechanisms.\n\n### Step 3: Mathematical Form\nThis suggests a linear utility structure composed of:\n- A positive weight for personal monetary gain (selfish utility).\n- A negative linear component penalizing for receiving less monetary payoff than the opponent.\n\nUtility form:\n\n\\[\nU = \\alpha \\cdot split\\_self - \\beta_{mon\\_disadv} \\cdot \\text{max}(split\\_opp - split\\_self, 0)\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Parameters Needed\nTwo learnable parameters are required:\n- \\(\\alpha\\) (alpha): Scales the absolute value of self monetary payoff (positive influence).\n- \\(\\beta_{mon\\_disadv}\\) (beta_mon_disadv): Scales negative sensitivity to amounts of monetary disadvantage relative to opponent.\n\n### Step 5: How Variables Map to Behavior\n- A large \\(\\beta_{mon\\_disadv}\\) would imply high sensitivity to monetary disadvantage: strongly disfavouring offers where the opponent gets more money (independent of proportional fairness or absolute token-based fairness).\n- A large \\(\\alpha\\) implies a primarily self-interested orientation towards absolute money.\n\nNow let's explicitly define the model and variables according to the provided format:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * split_self - beta_mon_disadv * max(split_opp - split_self, 0)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Responder's utility for accepting the proposal\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight for absolute monetary payoff (self-interest utility)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta_mon_disadv\": {\n      \"description\": \"Penalty applied per unit of absolute monetary disadvantage relative to opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Monetary payoff to the responder\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Monetary payoff to the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA linear utility model for responder behavior combining absolute monetary self-interest (\"alpha\") and linear sensitivity to disadvantageous monetary outcomes (\"beta_mon_disadv\").
