      "output": "Step by step reasoning:\n\nKey psychological mechanisms involved:\n\n- Previous models were strongly anchored in linear equity (proportional fairness based on contribution), heuristic equality, absolute loss of tokens converted to money, and opponent dominance (disadvantageous absolute differences). These prior mechanisms primarily evoke direct fairness/inequality concerns.\n- One important psychological construct not yet explicitly tested is whether responders derive utility directly from receiving relatively more money than opponents (\"advantageous monetary dominance\"). While model 6 considered disadvantageous opponent dominance and model 2 considered advantageous proportional inequity, neither explicitly captures a direct, linear utility increase from receiving strictly more money than their opponent, independent from proportionality and contributions. \n- Human participants may have a preference for \"winning\" or obtaining higher status, reflected by the utility of receiving strictly more money than their opponent. This may lead to a discrete utility increment whenever the participant obtains strictly greater monetary rewards compared to the opponent.\n- Therefore, the key psychological mechanisms we will test are: (1) absolute self-interest (monetary amount received), and (2) advantageous relative monetary dominance (explicit reward from being the one who receives strictly more money, a binary event separate from proportionality or absolute earnings).\n- These mechanisms could interact in a straightforward linear-additive fashion: Responders receive linear utility from the absolute amount received, plus an additional fixed boost whenever their share exceeds the absolute amount proposed to their opponent.\n- Given the concern about parameter covariance, it is advisable to have only one additional parameter besides absolute monetary interest (alpha). Thus, the second parameter will quantify a constant positive utility obtained whenever responders gain monetary dominance.\n\nMathematical form that could capture this interaction:\n\n- A linear additive model, combining a linear scale of own monetary payoff with a binary added positive utility whenever responders receive strictly more money than their opponent.\n\nParameters needed to calibrate the model:\n\n- alpha: scaling how much absolute amount matters.\n- beta_advantageous_mon_dominance: a learnable parameter capturing utility derived from strictly advantageous monetary dominance.\n\nHow the model variables map to observable behavior:\n\n- split_self and split_opp are used to determine whether the participant receives more money than their opponent.\n- If they do, \"beta_advantageous_mon_dominance\" positively shifts the utility of accepting the offer upwards.\n- Accepting such offers thus becomes more probable.\n\nFormal mathematical specification:\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * split_self + beta_advantageous_mon_dominance * I(split_self > split_opp)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the responder's current offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight on absolute monetary self-interest\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta_advantageous_mon_dominance\": {\n      \"description\": \"Incremental positive utility derived from receiving strictly more absolute money than opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Absolute monetary offer for the participant (in \u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Absolute monetary offer for the opponent (in \u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"I(split_self > split_opp)\": {\n      \"description\": \"Indicator function returning 1 if participant's monetary offer is strictly larger than opponent's offer, 0 otherwise\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA linear additive utility model combining absolute self-interested monetary payoffs (scaled by alpha) with a discrete boost in utility derived from advantageous monetary dominance\u2014receiving strictly more money than one's opponent (scaled by beta_advantageous_mon_dominance).
