Deviations from expected shares based purely on proportional contribution may cause negative utility through expectation violations.\n- Absolute Monetary Payoff: Participants naturally value higher monetary returns positively.\n\nInteraction of these mechanisms:\nResponders gain utility directly proportional to their absolute monetary payoff. However, they experience negative utility when the proposed offer deviates unfavorably from their proportional expectations of the combined earnings (thus negative deviation utility).\n\nPossible mathematical form:\nTo keep the model simple and psychologically interpretable, we consider a linear additive model with two components:\n- Absolute monetary payoff to responder (scaled by a learnable parameter), capturing pure self-interest.\n- Linear scaling of expectation violations defined as the absolute difference between expected fair payoff (proportional to tokens contributed) and actual absolute payoff received by the responder.\n\nParameters needed:\n- One parameter scaling absolute utility from monetary payoff (\"alpha\").\n- One parameter capturing sensitivity to deviations from proportional expectations (\"expectation_penalty\").\n\nVariable mapping to observable behavior:\n- Monetary absolute payoff (\"split_self\") is directly available from the dataset.\n- The deviation from proportional expectation can be calculated using tokens contributed (\"token_self\" and \"token_opp\") and total combined earnings (\"combined_earning\").\n\nThus, we define the following computational model clearly and explicitly below.\n\n<MODEL>\nU = alpha * split_self - expectation_penalty * max(((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning - split_self), 0)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offered split for the responder\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Scaling parameter for absolute monetary self-interest\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"expectation_penalty\": {\n      \"description\": \"Penalty parameter for receiving less money than the expected proportional share based on token contribution\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Absolute monetary amount proposed to the responder (\u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found initially by the responder\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total combined earnings contributed by responder and opponent (\u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA linear expectation-based utility model combining absolute monetary payoff (scaled by alpha) with a linear penalty for receiving less monetary payoff than expected based on proportional token contributions (scaled by expectation_penalty).
