If the offer falls short of this fair share, a penalty\u2014scaled by the inequity aversion parameter alpha\u2014is applied.

The fairness reference is computed from the participant\u2019s token share of the total tokens multiplied by the combined earning, and is modulated by the fairness scaling parameter tau.

The model uses a convex combination of split_self and a scaled fairness reference, where alpha (0 to 1) determines the weighting of fairness relative to pure self-interest, and tau (0 to 10) scales the fairness reference.\nBIC: 45.67592971143451\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.456\n- tau: r = 0.592\nModel 4:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nThen:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = { split_self\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003if split_self \u2265 fair_share\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003   split_self \u2013 alpha \u00b7 (fair_share \u2013 split_self)\u00b2\u2003if split_self < fair_share }\nSummary: A piecewise utility model for responder behavior where the utility of accepting an offer equals the monetary amount offered, except when the offer falls below a fairness reference computed from the participant\u2019s token share of the total earning. In such cases, a quadratic penalty\u2014scaled by the learnable inequity sensitivity parameter alpha\u2014is applied, capturing an escalating aversion to receiving an unfair split.\nBIC: 33.91799996790353\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.875\nModel 5:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThen, the utility for accepting an offer is defined as:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self + tau * log((split_self + epsilon) / fair_share)\nSummary: A model of responder behavior where the utility for accepting an offer integrates the direct monetary benefit with a logarithmic fairness adjustment. The fairness reference is derived from the participant's token share of the combined earnings, and a single learnable parameter, tau, scales the impact of deviations from this fairness standard.\nBIC: 33.930812889198855\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau: r = 0.951\nModel 6:\nSpecification: U_accept = split_self - beta * ( max(0, (token_self/(token_self + token_opp))*combined_earning - split_self) )^(gamma)\nSummary: A utility model for responder behavior that computes a fairness reference based on token contributions and total earnings, then applies a non-linear penalty to offers falling short of this reference. The utility is the actual monetary offer (split_self) reduced by beta times the fairness shortfall raised to the power of gamma.\nModel 7:\nSpecification: U_accept = log(1 + split_self) - alpha * log(1 + max(0, ((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) - split_self))\nSummary: A reference-dependent utility model that applies logarithmic (diminishing) sensitivity to both the offered monetary amount and any shortfall relative to a fairness benchmark computed from token contributions. The single learnable parameter, alpha, scales the penalty for offers below the fairness reference.\nBIC: 37.49636326995195\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.916\nModel 8:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning  \nLet d = max(0, fair_share - split_self)  \nU_accept = split_self - alpha * d - tau * (d)^2\nSummary: A two-parameter utility model for responder decisions where the utility of accepting an offer is the proposed monetary share reduced by a penalty applied when the offer falls short of a fairness benchmark (derived from the participant\u2019s token contribution). The penalty is composed of a linear term and an additional quadratic term, capturing both the immediate sensitivity and the escalating aversion to unfair splits.\nBIC: 34.81986374486485\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.508\n- tau: r = 0.364\nModel 9:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThen:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self - tau * (split_self - fair_share)^2.\nSummary: The model calculates a fairness reference based on the token ratio multiplied by the combined earnings. It then derives the utility for accepting an offer by subtracting a quadratic penalty\u2014scaled by a single learnable parameter tau\u2014from the offered monetary amount. This symmetric penalty for any deviation from the fairness benchmark captures the responder's sensitivity to unfair splits.\nBIC: 34.25802432850235\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau: r = 0.770\nModel 10:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nU_accept = [ (1 - tau_param) * (split_self)^(rho_param) + tau_param * (fair_share)^(rho_param) ]^(1/rho_param)\nSummary: This model computes the utility for a responder\u2019s acceptance decision as a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) aggregator between the actual offered amount (split_self) and a fairness reference derived from token contributions (fair_share). Two learnable parameters govern the integration: tau_param sets the relative weight of fairness and rho_param controls the curvature of substitution between self-interest and fairness.\nBIC: 66.80233137460259\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau_param: r = 0.341\n- rho_param: r = 0.336",

      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Key psychological mechanisms: In responder behavior, individuals compare the monetary offer (split_self) against an expected fair share derived from their token contribution relative to the group (computed as fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) \u00d7 combined_earning). Many studies indicate that deviations from this fairness reference matter. Moreover, responses can be asymmetric: people might experience additional negative feelings when offered less than what they consider fair (disadvantageous inequity), but they may also feel discomfort when receiving more than the fairness expectation (perhaps as guilt or social norm violation). Therefore, our model introduces distinct penalties for receiving an amount either below or above the fairness benchmark.\n\n2. Mechanism interactions: The offered amount (split_self) yields a base utility. In addition, any deviation from the fairness benchmark is penalized. To capture diminishing sensitivity, we apply a logarithmic transformation to both the reward and the deviations. Two separate learnable parameters (alpha and beta) are then used to scale the penalty for shortfalls (when split_self is less than fair_share) and surpluses (when split_self is above fair_share), respectively.\n\n3. Mathematical form: We define shortfall as max(0, fair_share \u2013 split_self) and surplus as max(0, split_self \u2013 fair_share). The utility is then given by a log-transformed benefit from split_self minus logarithmically scaled penalties on these deviations. \n\n4. Learnable parameter calibration: The two learnable parameters, alpha and beta, are defined with generous finite bounds (e.g., range [0, 10]). Alpha captures the sensitivity to receiving less than the fairness share while beta captures sensitivity to receiving more than the fairness share.\n\n5. Mapping to observable behavior: The model uses split_self as the observable offer and calculates a fairness benchmark based on token_self, token_opp, and combined_earning. The resulting utility U_accept (which may be negative for extreme deviations) serves as the decision variable\u2014lower utility corresponds to an unlikely acceptance of the offer.\n\nBased on this reasoning, here is our formal model specification:\n\n<MODEL>\nLet fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\nLet shortfall = max(0, fair_share - split_self)\nLet surplus = max(0, split_self - fair_share)\nU_accept = ln(1 + split_self) - alpha * ln(1 + shortfall) - beta * ln(1 + surplus)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer, combining the log-transformed reward and penalties for deviations from fairness\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"fair_share\": {\n      \"description\": \"The fairness benchmark computed as the proportional token share times the combined earning\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"shortfall\": {\n      \"description\": \"The amount by which the offer falls short of the fair share (zero if offer exceeds fair share)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"surplus\": {\n      \"description\": \"The amount by which the offer exceeds the fair share (zero if offer is below fair share)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Penalty sensitivity for disadvantageous inequity (when the offer is below the fairness benchmark)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 10.0,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Penalty sensitivity for advantageous inequity (when the offer is above the fairness benchmark)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 10.0,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money earned by the group, with conversion factor applied from tokens\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The proposed share for the participant (in money)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nThis model computes the utility of accepting an offer by first establishing a fairness benchmark based on the participant's token share of total tokens and combined earnings.

The utility is given by the log-transformed offered amount minus logarithmically scaled penalties for deviations from fairness. Two learnable parameters, alpha and beta, separately modulate sensitivity to receiving less than or more than the fairness benchmark.",
  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Key psychological mechanisms: In responder behavior, individuals compare the monetary offer (split_self) against an expected fair share derived from their token contribution relative to the group (computed as fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) \u00d7 combined_earning). Many studies indicate that deviations from this fairness reference matter. Moreover, responses can be asymmetric: people might experience additional negative feelings when offered less than what they consider fair (disadvantageous inequity), but they may also feel discomfort when receiving more than the fairness expectation (perhaps as guilt or social norm violation). Therefore, our model introduces distinct penalties for receiving an amount either below or above the fairness benchmark.\n\n2. Mechanism interactions: The offered amount (split_self) yields a base utility. In addition, any deviation from the fairness benchmark is penalized. To capture diminishing sensitivity, we apply a logarithmic transformation to both the reward and the deviations. Two separate learnable parameters (alpha and beta) are then used to scale the penalty for shortfalls (when split_self is less than fair_share) and surpluses (when split_self is above fair_share), respectively.\n\n3. Mathematical form: We define shortfall as max(0, fair_share \u2013 split_self) and surplus as max(0, split_self \u2013 fair_share). The utility is then given by a log-transformed benefit from split_self minus logarithmically scaled penalties on these deviations. \n\n4. Learnable parameter calibration: The two learnable parameters, alpha and beta, are defined with generous finite bounds (e.g., range [0, 10]). Alpha captures the sensitivity to receiving less than the fairness share while beta captures sensitivity to receiving more than the fairness share.\n\n5. Mapping to observable behavior: The model uses split_self as the observable offer and calculates a fairness benchmark based on token_self, token_opp, and combined_earning. The resulting utility U_accept (which may be negative for extreme deviations) serves as the decision variable\u2014lower utility corresponds to an unlikely acceptance of the offer.\n\nBased on this reasoning, here is our formal model specification:\n\n<MODEL>\nLet fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\nLet shortfall = max(0, fair_share - split_self)\nLet surplus = max(0, split_self - fair_share)\nU_accept = ln(1 + split_self) - alpha * ln(1 + shortfall) - beta * ln(1 + surplus)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer, combining the log-transformed reward and penalties for deviations from fairness\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"fair_share\": {\n      \"description\": \"The fairness benchmark computed as the proportional token share times the combined earning\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"shortfall\": {\n      \"description\": \"The amount by which the offer falls short of the fair share (zero if offer exceeds fair share)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"surplus\": {\n      \"description\": \"The amount by which the offer exceeds the fair share (zero if offer is below fair share)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Penalty sensitivity for disadvantageous inequity (when the offer is below the fairness benchmark)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 10.0,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Penalty sensitivity for advantageous inequity (when the offer is above the fairness benchmark)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 10.0,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money earned by the group, with conversion factor applied from tokens\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The proposed share for the participant (in money)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nThis model computes the utility of accepting an offer by first establishing a fairness benchmark based on the participant's token share of total tokens and combined earnings.

The utility is given by the log-transformed offered amount minus logarithmically scaled penalties for deviations from fairness. Two learnable parameters, alpha and beta, separately modulate sensitivity to receiving less than or more than the fairness benchmark.\nBIC: 40.96325099527113\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.870\n- beta: r = 0.519"
