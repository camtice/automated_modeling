If the offer falls short of this fair share, a penalty\u2014scaled by the inequity aversion parameter alpha\u2014is applied.

The fairness reference is computed from the participant\u2019s token share of the total tokens multiplied by the combined earning, and is modulated by the fairness scaling parameter tau. The inequity aversion parameter alpha determines the sensitivity to deviations below the (tau-scaled) reference.\nBIC: 35.25002573222929\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.501\n- tau: r = 0.863\nModel 3:\nSpecification: U_accept = (1 - alpha) * split_self + alpha * (tau * ((token_self) / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning)\nSummary: This model posits that responders compute the utility of accepting an offer by balancing the actual monetary offer with an expected fair share derived from their token contribution. The model uses a convex combination of split_self and a scaled fairness reference, where alpha (0 to 1) determines the weighting of fairness relative to pure self-interest, and tau (0 to 10) scales the fairness reference.\nBIC: 45.67592971143451\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.456\n- tau: r = 0.592\nModel 4:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nThen:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = { split_self\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003if split_self \u2265 fair_share\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003   split_self \u2013 alpha \u00b7 (fair_share \u2013 split_self)\u00b2\u2003if split_self < fair_share }\nSummary: A piecewise utility model for responder behavior where the utility of accepting an offer equals the monetary amount offered, except when the offer falls below a fairness reference computed from the participant\u2019s token share of the total earning. In such cases, a quadratic penalty\u2014scaled by the learnable inequity sensitivity parameter alpha\u2014is applied, capturing an escalating aversion to receiving an unfair split.\nBIC: 33.91799996790353\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.875\nModel 5:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThen, the utility for accepting an offer is defined as:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self + tau * log((split_self + epsilon) / fair_share)\nSummary: A model of responder behavior where the utility for accepting an offer integrates the direct monetary benefit with a logarithmic fairness adjustment. The fairness reference is derived from the participant's token share of the combined earnings, and a single learnable parameter, tau, scales the impact of deviations from this fairness standard.\nBIC: 33.930812889198855\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau: r = 0.951\nModel 6:\nSpecification: U_accept = split_self - beta * ( max(0, (token_self/(token_self + token_opp))*combined_earning - split_self) )^(gamma)\nSummary: A utility model for responder behavior that computes a fairness reference based on token contributions and total earnings, then applies a non-linear penalty to offers falling short of this reference. The utility is the actual monetary offer (split_self) reduced by beta times the fairness shortfall raised to the power of gamma.\nModel 7:\nSpecification: U_accept = log(1 + split_self) - alpha * log(1 + max(0, ((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) - split_self))\nSummary: A reference-dependent utility model that applies logarithmic (diminishing) sensitivity to both the offered monetary amount and any shortfall relative to a fairness benchmark computed from token contributions. The single learnable parameter, alpha, scales the penalty for offers below the fairness reference.\nBIC: 37.49636326995195\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.916\nModel 8:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning  \nLet d = max(0, fair_share - split_self)  \nU_accept = split_self - alpha * d - tau * (d)^2\nSummary: A two-parameter utility model for responder decisions where the utility of accepting an offer is the proposed monetary share reduced by a penalty applied when the offer falls short of a fairness benchmark (derived from the participant\u2019s token contribution). The penalty is composed of a linear term and an additional quadratic term, capturing both the immediate sensitivity and the escalating aversion to unfair splits.\nBIC: 34.81986374486485\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.508\n- tau: r = 0.364\nModel 9:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThen:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self - tau * (split_self - fair_share)^2.\nSummary: The model calculates a fairness reference based on the token ratio multiplied by the combined earnings. It then derives the utility for accepting an offer by subtracting a quadratic penalty\u2014scaled by a single learnable parameter tau\u2014from the offered monetary amount. This symmetric penalty for any deviation from the fairness benchmark captures the responder's sensitivity to unfair splits.\nBIC: 34.25802432850235\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau: r = 0.770\nModel 10:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nU_accept = [ (1 - tau_param) * (split_self)^(rho_param) + tau_param * (fair_share)^(rho_param) ]^(1/rho_param)\nSummary: This model computes the utility for a responder\u2019s acceptance decision as a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) aggregator between the actual offered amount (split_self) and a fairness reference derived from token contributions (fair_share). Two learnable parameters govern the integration: tau_param sets the relative weight of fairness and rho_param controls the curvature of substitution between self-interest and fairness.\nBIC: 66.80233137460259\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau_param: r = 0.341\n- rho_param: r = 0.336\nModel 11:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\nLet shortfall = max(0, fair_share - split_self)\nLet surplus = max(0, split_self - fair_share)\nU_accept = ln(1 + split_self) - alpha * ln(1 + shortfall) - beta * ln(1 + surplus)\nSummary: This model computes the utility of accepting an offer by first establishing a fairness benchmark based on the participant's token share of total tokens and combined earnings. The utility is given by the log-transformed offered amount minus logarithmically scaled penalties for deviations from fairness. Two learnable parameters, alpha and beta, separately modulate sensitivity to receiving less than or more than the fairness benchmark.\nBIC: 40.96325099527113\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.870\n- beta: r = 0.519",

The fairness reference is computed from the participant\u2019s token share of the total tokens multiplied by the combined earning, and is modulated by the fairness scaling parameter tau. The inequity aversion parameter alpha determines the sensitivity to deviations below the (tau-scaled) reference.\nBIC: 35.25002573222929\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.501\n- tau: r = 0.863\nModel 3:\nSpecification: U_accept = (1 - alpha) * split_self + alpha * (tau * ((token_self) / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning)\nSummary: This model posits that responders compute the utility of accepting an offer by balancing the actual monetary offer with an expected fair share derived from their token contribution. The model uses a convex combination of split_self and a scaled fairness reference, where alpha (0 to 1) determines the weighting of fairness relative to pure self-interest, and tau (0 to 10) scales the fairness reference.\nBIC: 45.67592971143451\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.456\n- tau: r = 0.592\nModel 4:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nThen:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = { split_self\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003if split_self \u2265 fair_share\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003   split_self \u2013 alpha \u00b7 (fair_share \u2013 split_self)\u00b2\u2003if split_self < fair_share }\nSummary: A piecewise utility model for responder behavior where the utility of accepting an offer equals the monetary amount offered, except when the offer falls below a fairness reference computed from the participant\u2019s token share of the total earning. In such cases, a quadratic penalty\u2014scaled by the learnable inequity sensitivity parameter alpha\u2014is applied, capturing an escalating aversion to receiving an unfair split.\nBIC: 33.91799996790353\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.875\nModel 5:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThen, the utility for accepting an offer is defined as:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self + tau * log((split_self + epsilon) / fair_share)\nSummary: A model of responder behavior where the utility for accepting an offer integrates the direct monetary benefit with a logarithmic fairness adjustment. The fairness reference is derived from the participant's token share of the combined earnings, and a single learnable parameter, tau, scales the impact of deviations from this fairness standard.\nBIC: 33.930812889198855\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau: r = 0.951\nModel 6:\nSpecification: U_accept = split_self - beta * ( max(0, (token_self/(token_self + token_opp))*combined_earning - split_self) )^(gamma)\nSummary: A utility model for responder behavior that computes a fairness reference based on token contributions and total earnings, then applies a non-linear penalty to offers falling short of this reference. The utility is the actual monetary offer (split_self) reduced by beta times the fairness shortfall raised to the power of gamma.\nModel 7:\nSpecification: U_accept = log(1 + split_self) - alpha * log(1 + max(0, ((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) - split_self))\nSummary: A reference-dependent utility model that applies logarithmic (diminishing) sensitivity to both the offered monetary amount and any shortfall relative to a fairness benchmark computed from token contributions. The single learnable parameter, alpha, scales the penalty for offers below the fairness reference.\nBIC: 37.49636326995195\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.916\nModel 8:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning  \nLet d = max(0, fair_share - split_self)  \nU_accept = split_self - alpha * d - tau * (d)^2\nSummary: A two-parameter utility model for responder decisions where the utility of accepting an offer is the proposed monetary share reduced by a penalty applied when the offer falls short of a fairness benchmark (derived from the participant\u2019s token contribution). The penalty is composed of a linear term and an additional quadratic term, capturing both the immediate sensitivity and the escalating aversion to unfair splits.\nBIC: 34.81986374486485\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.508\n- tau: r = 0.364\nModel 9:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThen:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self - tau * (split_self - fair_share)^2.\nSummary: The model calculates a fairness reference based on the token ratio multiplied by the combined earnings. It then derives the utility for accepting an offer by subtracting a quadratic penalty\u2014scaled by a single learnable parameter tau\u2014from the offered monetary amount. This symmetric penalty for any deviation from the fairness benchmark captures the responder's sensitivity to unfair splits.\nBIC: 34.25802432850235\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau: r = 0.770\nModel 10:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nU_accept = [ (1 - tau_param) * (split_self)^(rho_param) + tau_param * (fair_share)^(rho_param) ]^(1/rho_param)\nSummary: This model computes the utility for a responder\u2019s acceptance decision as a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) aggregator between the actual offered amount (split_self) and a fairness reference derived from token contributions (fair_share). Two learnable parameters govern the integration: tau_param sets the relative weight of fairness and rho_param controls the curvature of substitution between self-interest and fairness.\nBIC: 66.80233137460259\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau_param: r = 0.341\n- rho_param: r = 0.336\nModel 11:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\nLet shortfall = max(0, fair_share - split_self)\nLet surplus = max(0, split_self - fair_share)\nU_accept = ln(1 + split_self) - alpha * ln(1 + shortfall) - beta * ln(1 + surplus)\nSummary: This model computes the utility of accepting an offer by first establishing a fairness benchmark based on the participant's token share of total tokens and combined earnings. The utility is given by the log-transformed offered amount minus logarithmically scaled penalties for deviations from fairness. Two learnable parameters, alpha and beta, separately modulate sensitivity to receiving less than or more than the fairness benchmark.\nBIC: 40.96325099527113\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.870\n- beta: r = 0.519\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions.",
      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Key psychological mechanisms:\n\u2003\u2022 Responders compare the received monetary share (split_self) against a fairness reference determined by their proportional token contribution (fair_share = (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)) \u00b7 combined_earning).\n\u2003\u2022 They exhibit asymmetric sensitivity:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 When the offer falls short of fairness (split_self < fair_share), a penalty is applied.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 When the offer exceeds fairness (split_self > fair_share), an extra \u201cbonus\u201d might be experienced (though typically attenuated relative to the aversiveness of shortfalls). \n\u2003\u2022 The psychological response is smooth around the fairness point (no abrupt discontinuity) and captures diminishing sensitivity near the reference.\n\n2. Mechanism interactions:\n\u2003\u2022 The difference d = split_self \u2212 fair_share quantifies the deviation from the fairness benchmark.\n\u2003\u2022 A smooth, sigmoidal transformation (via logarithms of 1 + exp(\u00b7)) is applied both to negative and positive deviations\u2014ensuring that the penalty for shortfalls and bonus for surplus vary continuously.\n\n3. Mathematical form:\n\u2003\u2022 By defining two functions:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For negative deviations (d < 0): Use log(1 + exp(\u2013d)), which for large shortfalls approximates \u2013d.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For positive deviations (d > 0): Use log(1 + exp(d)), which approximates d.\n\u2003\u2022 Center each term by subtracting log2, so that at d = 0 no extra utility is added.\n\u2003\u2022 These terms are then weighted by two learnable parameters: alpha (sensitivity to shortfall) and beta (sensitivity to surplus).\n\n4. Required parameters:\n\u2003\u2022 Learnable parameter alpha (penalty weight) and beta (bonus weight).\n\u2003\u2022 Both parameters have generous but finite bounds.\n\n5. Mapping to observable behavior:\n\u2003\u2022 The utility of accepting an offer (U_accept) is computed as the actual monetary share (split_self), modulated by the logarithmically transformed deviation from a fairness reference.\n\u2003\u2022 Observed choices (accept/reject, via a later softmax with a temperature parameter) will depend on these computed utilities.\n\nThe final specification is provided below.\n\n<MODEL>\nLet fair_share = (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)) * combined_earning  \nLet d = split_self - fair_share  \nU_accept = split_self - alpha * ( log(1+exp(-d)) - log(2) ) + beta * ( log(1+exp(d)) - log(2) )\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting an offer, combining the monetary offer and adjustments for deviation from fairness.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The monetary share offered to the participant (in \u00a3).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant; used to compute fairness.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent; used to compute fairness.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total monetary amount to be split (in \u00a3), where each token is worth \u00a33.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Learnable sensitivity parameter for the penalty when the offer falls below the fairness reference.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Learnable sensitivity parameter for the bonus when the offer exceeds the fairness reference.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"d\": {\n      \"description\": \"The deviation of the offered monetary share from the fairness reference.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA smooth, reference-dependent utility model in which the utility of accepting an offer is given by the monetary amount (split_self) adjusted by asymmetrically penalizing shortfalls and optionally rewarding surpluses relative to a fairness benchmark computed as the participant\u2019s token share of the total earnings.

  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Key psychological mechanisms:\n\u2003\u2022 Responders compare the received monetary share (split_self) against a fairness reference determined by their proportional token contribution (fair_share = (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)) \u00b7 combined_earning).\n\u2003\u2022 They exhibit asymmetric sensitivity:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 When the offer falls short of fairness (split_self < fair_share), a penalty is applied.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 When the offer exceeds fairness (split_self > fair_share), an extra \u201cbonus\u201d might be experienced (though typically attenuated relative to the aversiveness of shortfalls). \n\u2003\u2022 The psychological response is smooth around the fairness point (no abrupt discontinuity) and captures diminishing sensitivity near the reference.\n\n2. Mechanism interactions:\n\u2003\u2022 The difference d = split_self \u2212 fair_share quantifies the deviation from the fairness benchmark.\n\u2003\u2022 A smooth, sigmoidal transformation (via logarithms of 1 + exp(\u00b7)) is applied both to negative and positive deviations\u2014ensuring that the penalty for shortfalls and bonus for surplus vary continuously.\n\n3. Mathematical form:\n\u2003\u2022 By defining two functions:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For negative deviations (d < 0): Use log(1 + exp(\u2013d)), which for large shortfalls approximates \u2013d.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For positive deviations (d > 0): Use log(1 + exp(d)), which approximates d.\n\u2003\u2022 Center each term by subtracting log2, so that at d = 0 no extra utility is added.\n\u2003\u2022 These terms are then weighted by two learnable parameters: alpha (sensitivity to shortfall) and beta (sensitivity to surplus).\n\n4. Required parameters:\n\u2003\u2022 Learnable parameter alpha (penalty weight) and beta (bonus weight).\n\u2003\u2022 Both parameters have generous but finite bounds.\n\n5. Mapping to observable behavior:\n\u2003\u2022 The utility of accepting an offer (U_accept) is computed as the actual monetary share (split_self), modulated by the logarithmically transformed deviation from a fairness reference.\n\u2003\u2022 Observed choices (accept/reject, via a later softmax with a temperature parameter) will depend on these computed utilities.\n\nThe final specification is provided below.\n\n<MODEL>\nLet fair_share = (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)) * combined_earning  \nLet d = split_self - fair_share  \nU_accept = split_self - alpha * ( log(1+exp(-d)) - log(2) ) + beta * ( log(1+exp(d)) - log(2) )\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting an offer, combining the monetary offer and adjustments for deviation from fairness.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The monetary share offered to the participant (in \u00a3).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant; used to compute fairness.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent; used to compute fairness.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total monetary amount to be split (in \u00a3), where each token is worth \u00a33.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Learnable sensitivity parameter for the penalty when the offer falls below the fairness reference.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Learnable sensitivity parameter for the bonus when the offer exceeds the fairness reference.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"d\": {\n      \"description\": \"The deviation of the offered monetary share from the fairness reference.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA smooth, reference-dependent utility model in which the utility of accepting an offer is given by the monetary amount (split_self) adjusted by asymmetrically penalizing shortfalls and optionally rewarding surpluses relative to a fairness benchmark computed as the participant\u2019s token share of the total earnings.
