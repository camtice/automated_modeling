If the offer falls short of this fair share, a penalty\u2014scaled by the inequity aversion parameter alpha\u2014is applied. The formulation captures a psychological sensitivity to disadvantageous inequity in a single-parameter specification.\nBIC: 34.61021336553505\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.922\nModel 2:\nSpecification: U_accept = split_self - alpha * max(0, (tau * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) - split_self)\nSummary: A two-parameter utility model for responder behavior where utility is derived from the actual offer (split_self) reduced by a penalty applied when the offer falls short of a scaled fairness reference. The fairness reference is computed from the participant\u2019s token share of the total tokens multiplied by the combined earning, and is modulated by the fairness scaling parameter tau. The inequity aversion parameter alpha determines the sensitivity to deviations below the (tau-scaled) reference.\nBIC: 35.25002573222929\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.501\n- tau: r = 0.863\nModel 3:\nSpecification: U_accept = (1 - alpha) * split_self + alpha * (tau * ((token_self) / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning)\nSummary: This model posits that responders compute the utility of accepting an offer by balancing the actual monetary offer with an expected fair share derived from their token contribution. The model uses a convex combination of split_self and a scaled fairness reference, where alpha (0 to 1) determines the weighting of fairness relative to pure self-interest, and tau (0 to 10) scales the fairness reference.\nBIC: 45.67592971143451\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.456\n- tau: r = 0.592\nModel 4:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nThen:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = { split_self\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003if split_self \u2265 fair_share\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003   split_self \u2013 alpha \u00b7 (fair_share \u2013 split_self)\u00b2\u2003if split_self < fair_share }\nSummary: A piecewise utility model for responder behavior where the utility of accepting an offer equals the monetary amount offered, except when the offer falls below a fairness reference computed from the participant\u2019s token share of the total earning. In such cases, a quadratic penalty\u2014scaled by the learnable inequity sensitivity parameter alpha\u2014is applied, capturing an escalating aversion to receiving an unfair split.\nBIC: 33.91799996790353\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.875\nModel 5:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThen, the utility for accepting an offer is defined as:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self + tau * log((split_self + epsilon) / fair_share)\nSummary: A model of responder behavior where the utility for accepting an offer integrates the direct monetary benefit with a logarithmic fairness adjustment. The fairness reference is derived from the participant's token share of the combined earnings, and a single learnable parameter, tau, scales the impact of deviations from this fairness standard.\nBIC: 33.930812889198855\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau: r = 0.951\nModel 6:\nSpecification: U_accept = split_self - beta * ( max(0, (token_self/(token_self + token_opp))*combined_earning - split_self) )^(gamma)\nSummary: A utility model for responder behavior that computes a fairness reference based on token contributions and total earnings, then applies a non-linear penalty to offers falling short of this reference. The utility is the actual monetary offer (split_self) reduced by beta times the fairness shortfall raised to the power of gamma.\nModel 7:\nSpecification: U_accept = log(1 + split_self) - alpha * log(1 + max(0, ((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) - split_self))\nSummary: A reference-dependent utility model that applies logarithmic (diminishing) sensitivity to both the offered monetary amount and any shortfall relative to a fairness benchmark computed from token contributions. The single learnable parameter, alpha, scales the penalty for offers below the fairness reference.\nBIC: 37.49636326995195\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.916\nModel 8:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning  \nLet d = max(0, fair_share - split_self)  \nU_accept = split_self - alpha * d - tau * (d)^2\nSummary: A two-parameter utility model for responder decisions where the utility of accepting an offer is the proposed monetary share reduced by a penalty applied when the offer falls short of a fairness benchmark (derived from the participant\u2019s token contribution). The penalty is composed of a linear term and an additional quadratic term, capturing both the immediate sensitivity and the escalating aversion to unfair splits.\nBIC: 34.81986374486485\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.508\n- tau: r = 0.364\nModel 9:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThen:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self - tau * (split_self - fair_share)^2.\nSummary: The model calculates a fairness reference based on the token ratio multiplied by the combined earnings. It then derives the utility for accepting an offer by subtracting a quadratic penalty\u2014scaled by a single learnable parameter tau\u2014from the offered monetary amount. This symmetric penalty for any deviation from the fairness benchmark captures the responder's sensitivity to unfair splits.\nBIC: 34.25802432850235\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau: r = 0.770\nModel 10:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nU_accept = [ (1 - tau_param) * (split_self)^(rho_param) + tau_param * (fair_share)^(rho_param) ]^(1/rho_param)\nSummary: This model computes the utility for a responder\u2019s acceptance decision as a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) aggregator between the actual offered amount (split_self) and a fairness reference derived from token contributions (fair_share). Two learnable parameters govern the integration: tau_param sets the relative weight of fairness and rho_param controls the curvature of substitution between self-interest and fairness.\nBIC: 66.80233137460259\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau_param: r = 0.341\n- rho_param: r = 0.336\nModel 11:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\nLet shortfall = max(0, fair_share - split_self)\nLet surplus = max(0, split_self - fair_share)\nU_accept = ln(1 + split_self) - alpha * ln(1 + shortfall) - beta * ln(1 + surplus)\nSummary: This model computes the utility of accepting an offer by first establishing a fairness benchmark based on the participant's token share of total tokens and combined earnings. The utility is given by the log-transformed offered amount minus logarithmically scaled penalties for deviations from fairness. Two learnable parameters, alpha and beta, separately modulate sensitivity to receiving less than or more than the fairness benchmark.\nBIC: 40.96325099527113\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.870\n- beta: r = 0.519\nModel 12:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)) * combined_earning  \nLet d = split_self - fair_share  \nU_accept = split_self - alpha * ( log(1+exp(-d)) - log(2) ) + beta * ( log(1+exp(d)) - log(2) )\nSummary: A smooth, reference-dependent utility model in which the utility of accepting an offer is given by the monetary amount (split_self) adjusted by asymmetrically penalizing shortfalls and optionally rewarding surpluses relative to a fairness benchmark computed as the participant\u2019s token share of the total earnings. The adjustments are implemented using centered logarithmic transforms of the deviation, weighted by two learnable parameters (alpha and beta).\nBIC: 34.82214294286025\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.317\n- beta: r = 0.319",

If there are no previous models, start with one learnable parameter, then ensure the space of possible models is thoroughly explored with one parameter before moving to two parameters, etc.\n\nYour results will be scored on a combination of BIC with a penalization for number of learned parameters, the ability to recover those learned parameters, and the ability of those parameters to account for the differences in behaviors among varying groups of people.\n\nPrevious Models:\nModel 1:\nSpecification: U_accept = split_self - alpha * max(0, ( (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning - split_self ))\nSummary: The model computes the utility for a responder\u2019s acceptance decision by comparing the actual monetary offer to a fair share calculated from the participant's proportional contribution. If the offer falls short of this fair share, a penalty\u2014scaled by the inequity aversion parameter alpha\u2014is applied. The formulation captures a psychological sensitivity to disadvantageous inequity in a single-parameter specification.\nBIC: 34.61021336553505\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.922\nModel 2:\nSpecification: U_accept = split_self - alpha * max(0, (tau * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) - split_self)\nSummary: A two-parameter utility model for responder behavior where utility is derived from the actual offer (split_self) reduced by a penalty applied when the offer falls short of a scaled fairness reference. The fairness reference is computed from the participant\u2019s token share of the total tokens multiplied by the combined earning, and is modulated by the fairness scaling parameter tau. The inequity aversion parameter alpha determines the sensitivity to deviations below the (tau-scaled) reference.\nBIC: 35.25002573222929\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.501\n- tau: r = 0.863\nModel 3:\nSpecification: U_accept = (1 - alpha) * split_self + alpha * (tau * ((token_self) / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning)\nSummary: This model posits that responders compute the utility of accepting an offer by balancing the actual monetary offer with an expected fair share derived from their token contribution. The model uses a convex combination of split_self and a scaled fairness reference, where alpha (0 to 1) determines the weighting of fairness relative to pure self-interest, and tau (0 to 10) scales the fairness reference.\nBIC: 45.67592971143451\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.456\n- tau: r = 0.592\nModel 4:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nThen:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = { split_self\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003if split_self \u2265 fair_share\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003   split_self \u2013 alpha \u00b7 (fair_share \u2013 split_self)\u00b2\u2003if split_self < fair_share }\nSummary: A piecewise utility model for responder behavior where the utility of accepting an offer equals the monetary amount offered, except when the offer falls below a fairness reference computed from the participant\u2019s token share of the total earning. In such cases, a quadratic penalty\u2014scaled by the learnable inequity sensitivity parameter alpha\u2014is applied, capturing an escalating aversion to receiving an unfair split.\nBIC: 33.91799996790353\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.875\nModel 5:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThen, the utility for accepting an offer is defined as:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self + tau * log((split_self + epsilon) / fair_share)\nSummary: A model of responder behavior where the utility for accepting an offer integrates the direct monetary benefit with a logarithmic fairness adjustment. The fairness reference is derived from the participant's token share of the combined earnings, and a single learnable parameter, tau, scales the impact of deviations from this fairness standard.\nBIC: 33.930812889198855\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau: r = 0.951\nModel 6:\nSpecification: U_accept = split_self - beta * ( max(0, (token_self/(token_self + token_opp))*combined_earning - split_self) )^(gamma)\nSummary: A utility model for responder behavior that computes a fairness reference based on token contributions and total earnings, then applies a non-linear penalty to offers falling short of this reference. The utility is the actual monetary offer (split_self) reduced by beta times the fairness shortfall raised to the power of gamma.\nModel 7:\nSpecification: U_accept = log(1 + split_self) - alpha * log(1 + max(0, ((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) - split_self))\nSummary: A reference-dependent utility model that applies logarithmic (diminishing) sensitivity to both the offered monetary amount and any shortfall relative to a fairness benchmark computed from token contributions. The single learnable parameter, alpha, scales the penalty for offers below the fairness reference.\nBIC: 37.49636326995195\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.916\nModel 8:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning  \nLet d = max(0, fair_share - split_self)  \nU_accept = split_self - alpha * d - tau * (d)^2\nSummary: A two-parameter utility model for responder decisions where the utility of accepting an offer is the proposed monetary share reduced by a penalty applied when the offer falls short of a fairness benchmark (derived from the participant\u2019s token contribution). The penalty is composed of a linear term and an additional quadratic term, capturing both the immediate sensitivity and the escalating aversion to unfair splits.\nBIC: 34.81986374486485\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.508\n- tau: r = 0.364\nModel 9:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThen:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self - tau * (split_self - fair_share)^2.\nSummary: The model calculates a fairness reference based on the token ratio multiplied by the combined earnings. It then derives the utility for accepting an offer by subtracting a quadratic penalty\u2014scaled by a single learnable parameter tau\u2014from the offered monetary amount. This symmetric penalty for any deviation from the fairness benchmark captures the responder's sensitivity to unfair splits.\nBIC: 34.25802432850235\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau: r = 0.770\nModel 10:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nU_accept = [ (1 - tau_param) * (split_self)^(rho_param) + tau_param * (fair_share)^(rho_param) ]^(1/rho_param)\nSummary: This model computes the utility for a responder\u2019s acceptance decision as a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) aggregator between the actual offered amount (split_self) and a fairness reference derived from token contributions (fair_share). Two learnable parameters govern the integration: tau_param sets the relative weight of fairness and rho_param controls the curvature of substitution between self-interest and fairness.\nBIC: 66.80233137460259\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau_param: r = 0.341\n- rho_param: r = 0.336\nModel 11:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\nLet shortfall = max(0, fair_share - split_self)\nLet surplus = max(0, split_self - fair_share)\nU_accept = ln(1 + split_self) - alpha * ln(1 + shortfall) - beta * ln(1 + surplus)\nSummary: This model computes the utility of accepting an offer by first establishing a fairness benchmark based on the participant's token share of total tokens and combined earnings. The utility is given by the log-transformed offered amount minus logarithmically scaled penalties for deviations from fairness. Two learnable parameters, alpha and beta, separately modulate sensitivity to receiving less than or more than the fairness benchmark.\nBIC: 40.96325099527113\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.870\n- beta: r = 0.519\nModel 12:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)) * combined_earning  \nLet d = split_self - fair_share  \nU_accept = split_self - alpha * ( log(1+exp(-d)) - log(2) ) + beta * ( log(1+exp(d)) - log(2) )\nSummary: A smooth, reference-dependent utility model in which the utility of accepting an offer is given by the monetary amount (split_self) adjusted by asymmetrically penalizing shortfalls and optionally rewarding surpluses relative to a fairness benchmark computed as the participant\u2019s token share of the total earnings. The adjustments are implemented using centered logarithmic transforms of the deviation, weighted by two learnable parameters (alpha and beta).\nBIC: 34.82214294286025\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.317\n- beta: r = 0.319\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions.",
      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Key psychological mechanism:\n\u2003\u2022 Responders compare the actual offer (split_self) with a fairness standard (fair_share) derived from their token contribution relative to the total tokens and the available combined earnings.\n\u2003\u2022 When the offer is below the fair share, the responder experiences a proportional penalty relative to the relative shortfall.\n\u2003\u2022 This reflects fairness sensitivity: the more the offer deviates proportionally from what is \u201cfair\u201d, the more the perceived value (utility) of accepting the offer is diminished.\n\n2. Interaction of mechanisms:\n\u2003\u2022 First, compute a fairness benchmark: fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) \u00d7 combined_earning.\n\u2003\u2022 Then, measure a relative shortfall if the offered monetary amount split_self is below fair_share.\n\u2003\u2022 The utility is then the received monetary offer adjusted (discounted) by the relative shortfall scaled by a fairness sensitivity parameter (tau). For offers at or above fair_share no penalty is applied.\n\n3. Mathematical form:\n\u2003\u2022 Let relative_short = max(0, (fair_share \u2212 split_self)) / fair_share.\n\u2003\u2022 Then, utility is given by U_accept = split_self \u00d7 (1 \u2212 tau \u00d7 relative_short).\n\n4. Parameters:\n\u2003\u2022 One learnable parameter, tau, represents the sensitivity to inequity. It is bounded (e.g., 0 \u2264 tau \u2264 1) so that higher values correspond to greater penalization relative to the proportional shortfall.\n\n5. Mapping to observable behavior:\n\u2003\u2022 Observed data provide token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, and split_self.\n\u2003\u2022 The model calculates a fairness reference (fair_share) for each trial.\n\u2003\u2022 The relative deviation is normalized (relative_short) and used to penalize the monetary offer accordingly.\n\u2003\u2022 The computed utility U_accept (which can take negative values when the penalty is severe) can then be used (by subsequent processing with a softmax or similar verbal procedure) to determine the probability that the responder accepts the offer.\n\nThe final formal model specification and variable descriptions are provided below.\n\n<MODEL>\nfair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\nrelative_short = max(0, fair_share - split_self) / fair_share\nU_accept = split_self * (1 - tau * relative_short)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer; computed as the adjusted offer after a fairness penalty.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"fair_share\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fairness benchmark computed as the participant's proportional share of combined earnings.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"relative_short\": {\n      \"description\": \"The relative shortfall when split_self is below fair_share, normalized by fair_share.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"tau\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fairness sensitivity parameter that controls the magnitude of penalty for offers below fair_share.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"low\": 0,\n          \"high\": 1\n        }\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total earnings (in \u00a3) available for splitting; each token is worth \u00a33.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Monetary amount (in \u00a3) offered to the participant.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA reference-dependent utility model for responders that computes a fairness benchmark based on token contributions and combined earnings.

When the monetary offer falls below this fairness standard, the utility is multiplicatively discounted by a factor proportional to the relative shortfall, scaled by the single fairness sensitivity parameter tau.",
  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Key psychological mechanism:\n\u2003\u2022 Responders compare the actual offer (split_self) with a fairness standard (fair_share) derived from their token contribution relative to the total tokens and the available combined earnings.\n\u2003\u2022 When the offer is below the fair share, the responder experiences a proportional penalty relative to the relative shortfall.\n\u2003\u2022 This reflects fairness sensitivity: the more the offer deviates proportionally from what is \u201cfair\u201d, the more the perceived value (utility) of accepting the offer is diminished.\n\n2. Interaction of mechanisms:\n\u2003\u2022 First, compute a fairness benchmark: fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) \u00d7 combined_earning.\n\u2003\u2022 Then, measure a relative shortfall if the offered monetary amount split_self is below fair_share.\n\u2003\u2022 The utility is then the received monetary offer adjusted (discounted) by the relative shortfall scaled by a fairness sensitivity parameter (tau). For offers at or above fair_share no penalty is applied.\n\n3. Mathematical form:\n\u2003\u2022 Let relative_short = max(0, (fair_share \u2212 split_self)) / fair_share.\n\u2003\u2022 Then, utility is given by U_accept = split_self \u00d7 (1 \u2212 tau \u00d7 relative_short).\n\n4. Parameters:\n\u2003\u2022 One learnable parameter, tau, represents the sensitivity to inequity. It is bounded (e.g., 0 \u2264 tau \u2264 1) so that higher values correspond to greater penalization relative to the proportional shortfall.\n\n5. Mapping to observable behavior:\n\u2003\u2022 Observed data provide token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, and split_self.\n\u2003\u2022 The model calculates a fairness reference (fair_share) for each trial.\n\u2003\u2022 The relative deviation is normalized (relative_short) and used to penalize the monetary offer accordingly.\n\u2003\u2022 The computed utility U_accept (which can take negative values when the penalty is severe) can then be used (by subsequent processing with a softmax or similar verbal procedure) to determine the probability that the responder accepts the offer.\n\nThe final formal model specification and variable descriptions are provided below.\n\n<MODEL>\nfair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\nrelative_short = max(0, fair_share - split_self) / fair_share\nU_accept = split_self * (1 - tau * relative_short)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer; computed as the adjusted offer after a fairness penalty.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"fair_share\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fairness benchmark computed as the participant's proportional share of combined earnings.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"relative_short\": {\n      \"description\": \"The relative shortfall when split_self is below fair_share, normalized by fair_share.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"tau\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fairness sensitivity parameter that controls the magnitude of penalty for offers below fair_share.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"low\": 0,\n          \"high\": 1\n        }\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total earnings (in \u00a3) available for splitting; each token is worth \u00a33.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Monetary amount (in \u00a3) offered to the participant.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {},\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA reference-dependent utility model for responders that computes a fairness benchmark based on token contributions and combined earnings.
