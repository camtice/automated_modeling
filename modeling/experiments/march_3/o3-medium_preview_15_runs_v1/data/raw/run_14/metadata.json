If the offer falls short of this fair share, a penalty\u2014scaled by the inequity aversion parameter alpha\u2014is applied. The formulation captures a psychological sensitivity to disadvantageous inequity in a single-parameter specification.\nBIC: 34.61021336553505\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.922\nModel 2:\nSpecification: U_accept = split_self - alpha * max(0, (tau * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) - split_self)\nSummary: A two-parameter utility model for responder behavior where utility is derived from the actual offer (split_self) reduced by a penalty applied when the offer falls short of a scaled fairness reference. The fairness reference is computed from the participant\u2019s token share of the total tokens multiplied by the combined earning, and is modulated by the fairness scaling parameter tau. The inequity aversion parameter alpha determines the sensitivity to deviations below the (tau-scaled) reference.\nBIC: 35.25002573222929\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.501\n- tau: r = 0.863\nModel 3:\nSpecification: U_accept = (1 - alpha) * split_self + alpha * (tau * ((token_self) / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning)\nSummary: This model posits that responders compute the utility of accepting an offer by balancing the actual monetary offer with an expected fair share derived from their token contribution. The model uses a convex combination of split_self and a scaled fairness reference, where alpha (0 to 1) determines the weighting of fairness relative to pure self-interest, and tau (0 to 10) scales the fairness reference.\nBIC: 45.67592971143451\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.456\n- tau: r = 0.592\nModel 4:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nThen:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = { split_self\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003if split_self \u2265 fair_share\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003   split_self \u2013 alpha \u00b7 (fair_share \u2013 split_self)\u00b2\u2003if split_self < fair_share }\nSummary: A piecewise utility model for responder behavior where the utility of accepting an offer equals the monetary amount offered, except when the offer falls below a fairness reference computed from the participant\u2019s token share of the total earning. In such cases, a quadratic penalty\u2014scaled by the learnable inequity sensitivity parameter alpha\u2014is applied, capturing an escalating aversion to receiving an unfair split.\nBIC: 33.91799996790353\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.875\nModel 5:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThen, the utility for accepting an offer is defined as:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self + tau * log((split_self + epsilon) / fair_share)\nSummary: A model of responder behavior where the utility for accepting an offer integrates the direct monetary benefit with a logarithmic fairness adjustment. The fairness reference is derived from the participant's token share of the combined earnings, and a single learnable parameter, tau, scales the impact of deviations from this fairness standard.\nBIC: 33.930812889198855\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau: r = 0.951\nModel 6:\nSpecification: U_accept = split_self - beta * ( max(0, (token_self/(token_self + token_opp))*combined_earning - split_self) )^(gamma)\nSummary: A utility model for responder behavior that computes a fairness reference based on token contributions and total earnings, then applies a non-linear penalty to offers falling short of this reference. The utility is the actual monetary offer (split_self) reduced by beta times the fairness shortfall raised to the power of gamma.\nModel 7:\nSpecification: U_accept = log(1 + split_self) - alpha * log(1 + max(0, ((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) - split_self))\nSummary: A reference-dependent utility model that applies logarithmic (diminishing) sensitivity to both the offered monetary amount and any shortfall relative to a fairness benchmark computed from token contributions. The single learnable parameter, alpha, scales the penalty for offers below the fairness reference.\nBIC: 37.49636326995195\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.916\nModel 8:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning  \nLet d = max(0, fair_share - split_self)  \nU_accept = split_self - alpha * d - tau * (d)^2\nSummary: A two-parameter utility model for responder decisions where the utility of accepting an offer is the proposed monetary share reduced by a penalty applied when the offer falls short of a fairness benchmark (derived from the participant\u2019s token contribution). The penalty is composed of a linear term and an additional quadratic term, capturing both the immediate sensitivity and the escalating aversion to unfair splits.\nBIC: 34.81986374486485\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.508\n- tau: r = 0.364\nModel 9:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThen:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self - tau * (split_self - fair_share)^2.\nSummary: The model calculates a fairness reference based on the token ratio multiplied by the combined earnings. It then derives the utility for accepting an offer by subtracting a quadratic penalty\u2014scaled by a single learnable parameter tau\u2014from the offered monetary amount. This symmetric penalty for any deviation from the fairness benchmark captures the responder's sensitivity to unfair splits.\nBIC: 34.25802432850235\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau: r = 0.770\nModel 10:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nU_accept = [ (1 - tau_param) * (split_self)^(rho_param) + tau_param * (fair_share)^(rho_param) ]^(1/rho_param)\nSummary: This model computes the utility for a responder\u2019s acceptance decision as a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) aggregator between the actual offered amount (split_self) and a fairness reference derived from token contributions (fair_share). Two learnable parameters govern the integration: tau_param sets the relative weight of fairness and rho_param controls the curvature of substitution between self-interest and fairness.\nBIC: 66.80233137460259\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau_param: r = 0.341\n- rho_param: r = 0.336\nModel 11:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\nLet shortfall = max(0, fair_share - split_self)\nLet surplus = max(0, split_self - fair_share)\nU_accept = ln(1 + split_self) - alpha * ln(1 + shortfall) - beta * ln(1 + surplus)\nSummary: This model computes the utility of accepting an offer by first establishing a fairness benchmark based on the participant's token share of total tokens and combined earnings. The utility is given by the log-transformed offered amount minus logarithmically scaled penalties for deviations from fairness. Two learnable parameters, alpha and beta, separately modulate sensitivity to receiving less than or more than the fairness benchmark.\nBIC: 40.96325099527113\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.870\n- beta: r = 0.519\nModel 12:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)) * combined_earning  \nLet d = split_self - fair_share  \nU_accept = split_self - alpha * ( log(1+exp(-d)) - log(2) ) + beta * ( log(1+exp(d)) - log(2) )\nSummary: A smooth, reference-dependent utility model in which the utility of accepting an offer is given by the monetary amount (split_self) adjusted by asymmetrically penalizing shortfalls and optionally rewarding surpluses relative to a fairness benchmark computed as the participant\u2019s token share of the total earnings. The adjustments are implemented using centered logarithmic transforms of the deviation, weighted by two learnable parameters (alpha and beta).\nBIC: 34.82214294286025\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.317\n- beta: r = 0.319\nModel 13:\nSpecification: fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\nrelative_short = max(0, fair_share - split_self) / fair_share\nU_accept = split_self * (1 - tau * relative_short)\nSummary: A reference-dependent utility model for responders that computes a fairness benchmark based on token contributions and combined earnings. When the monetary offer falls below this fairness standard, the utility is multiplicatively discounted by a factor proportional to the relative shortfall, scaled by the single fairness sensitivity parameter tau.\nBIC: 51.04425856409312\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau: r = 0.343",

Pay less attention to the names of the variables, and how they are actually interacting with the given behavioral data. If there are no previous models, start with one learnable parameter, then ensure the space of possible models is thoroughly explored with one parameter before moving to two parameters, etc.\n\nYour results will be scored on a combination of BIC with a penalization for number of learned parameters, the ability to recover those learned parameters, and the ability of those parameters to account for the differences in behaviors among varying groups of people.\n\nPrevious Models:\nModel 1:\nSpecification: U_accept = split_self - alpha * max(0, ( (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning - split_self ))\nSummary: The model computes the utility for a responder\u2019s acceptance decision by comparing the actual monetary offer to a fair share calculated from the participant's proportional contribution. If the offer falls short of this fair share, a penalty\u2014scaled by the inequity aversion parameter alpha\u2014is applied. The formulation captures a psychological sensitivity to disadvantageous inequity in a single-parameter specification.\nBIC: 34.61021336553505\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.922\nModel 2:\nSpecification: U_accept = split_self - alpha * max(0, (tau * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) - split_self)\nSummary: A two-parameter utility model for responder behavior where utility is derived from the actual offer (split_self) reduced by a penalty applied when the offer falls short of a scaled fairness reference. The fairness reference is computed from the participant\u2019s token share of the total tokens multiplied by the combined earning, and is modulated by the fairness scaling parameter tau. The inequity aversion parameter alpha determines the sensitivity to deviations below the (tau-scaled) reference.\nBIC: 35.25002573222929\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.501\n- tau: r = 0.863\nModel 3:\nSpecification: U_accept = (1 - alpha) * split_self + alpha * (tau * ((token_self) / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning)\nSummary: This model posits that responders compute the utility of accepting an offer by balancing the actual monetary offer with an expected fair share derived from their token contribution. The model uses a convex combination of split_self and a scaled fairness reference, where alpha (0 to 1) determines the weighting of fairness relative to pure self-interest, and tau (0 to 10) scales the fairness reference.\nBIC: 45.67592971143451\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.456\n- tau: r = 0.592\nModel 4:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nThen:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = { split_self\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003if split_self \u2265 fair_share\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003   split_self \u2013 alpha \u00b7 (fair_share \u2013 split_self)\u00b2\u2003if split_self < fair_share }\nSummary: A piecewise utility model for responder behavior where the utility of accepting an offer equals the monetary amount offered, except when the offer falls below a fairness reference computed from the participant\u2019s token share of the total earning. In such cases, a quadratic penalty\u2014scaled by the learnable inequity sensitivity parameter alpha\u2014is applied, capturing an escalating aversion to receiving an unfair split.\nBIC: 33.91799996790353\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.875\nModel 5:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThen, the utility for accepting an offer is defined as:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self + tau * log((split_self + epsilon) / fair_share)\nSummary: A model of responder behavior where the utility for accepting an offer integrates the direct monetary benefit with a logarithmic fairness adjustment. The fairness reference is derived from the participant's token share of the combined earnings, and a single learnable parameter, tau, scales the impact of deviations from this fairness standard.\nBIC: 33.930812889198855\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau: r = 0.951\nModel 6:\nSpecification: U_accept = split_self - beta * ( max(0, (token_self/(token_self + token_opp))*combined_earning - split_self) )^(gamma)\nSummary: A utility model for responder behavior that computes a fairness reference based on token contributions and total earnings, then applies a non-linear penalty to offers falling short of this reference. The utility is the actual monetary offer (split_self) reduced by beta times the fairness shortfall raised to the power of gamma.\nModel 7:\nSpecification: U_accept = log(1 + split_self) - alpha * log(1 + max(0, ((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) - split_self))\nSummary: A reference-dependent utility model that applies logarithmic (diminishing) sensitivity to both the offered monetary amount and any shortfall relative to a fairness benchmark computed from token contributions. The single learnable parameter, alpha, scales the penalty for offers below the fairness reference.\nBIC: 37.49636326995195\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.916\nModel 8:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning  \nLet d = max(0, fair_share - split_self)  \nU_accept = split_self - alpha * d - tau * (d)^2\nSummary: A two-parameter utility model for responder decisions where the utility of accepting an offer is the proposed monetary share reduced by a penalty applied when the offer falls short of a fairness benchmark (derived from the participant\u2019s token contribution). The penalty is composed of a linear term and an additional quadratic term, capturing both the immediate sensitivity and the escalating aversion to unfair splits.\nBIC: 34.81986374486485\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.508\n- tau: r = 0.364\nModel 9:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThen:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self - tau * (split_self - fair_share)^2.\nSummary: The model calculates a fairness reference based on the token ratio multiplied by the combined earnings. It then derives the utility for accepting an offer by subtracting a quadratic penalty\u2014scaled by a single learnable parameter tau\u2014from the offered monetary amount. This symmetric penalty for any deviation from the fairness benchmark captures the responder's sensitivity to unfair splits.\nBIC: 34.25802432850235\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau: r = 0.770\nModel 10:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nU_accept = [ (1 - tau_param) * (split_self)^(rho_param) + tau_param * (fair_share)^(rho_param) ]^(1/rho_param)\nSummary: This model computes the utility for a responder\u2019s acceptance decision as a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) aggregator between the actual offered amount (split_self) and a fairness reference derived from token contributions (fair_share). Two learnable parameters govern the integration: tau_param sets the relative weight of fairness and rho_param controls the curvature of substitution between self-interest and fairness.\nBIC: 66.80233137460259\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau_param: r = 0.341\n- rho_param: r = 0.336\nModel 11:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\nLet shortfall = max(0, fair_share - split_self)\nLet surplus = max(0, split_self - fair_share)\nU_accept = ln(1 + split_self) - alpha * ln(1 + shortfall) - beta * ln(1 + surplus)\nSummary: This model computes the utility of accepting an offer by first establishing a fairness benchmark based on the participant's token share of total tokens and combined earnings. The utility is given by the log-transformed offered amount minus logarithmically scaled penalties for deviations from fairness. Two learnable parameters, alpha and beta, separately modulate sensitivity to receiving less than or more than the fairness benchmark.\nBIC: 40.96325099527113\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.870\n- beta: r = 0.519\nModel 12:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)) * combined_earning  \nLet d = split_self - fair_share  \nU_accept = split_self - alpha * ( log(1+exp(-d)) - log(2) ) + beta * ( log(1+exp(d)) - log(2) )\nSummary: A smooth, reference-dependent utility model in which the utility of accepting an offer is given by the monetary amount (split_self) adjusted by asymmetrically penalizing shortfalls and optionally rewarding surpluses relative to a fairness benchmark computed as the participant\u2019s token share of the total earnings. The adjustments are implemented using centered logarithmic transforms of the deviation, weighted by two learnable parameters (alpha and beta).\nBIC: 34.82214294286025\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.317\n- beta: r = 0.319\nModel 13:\nSpecification: fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\nrelative_short = max(0, fair_share - split_self) / fair_share\nU_accept = split_self * (1 - tau * relative_short)\nSummary: A reference-dependent utility model for responders that computes a fairness benchmark based on token contributions and combined earnings. When the monetary offer falls below this fairness standard, the utility is multiplicatively discounted by a factor proportional to the relative shortfall, scaled by the single fairness sensitivity parameter tau.\nBIC: 51.04425856409312\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau: r = 0.343\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions.",
      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n\u2022 Psychological Mechanisms:\n\u2003\u2013 The responder evaluates the offer (split_self) not only based on its nominal monetary value, but also by comparing it to a fairness reference. That fairness reference is derived from the participant\u2019s contribution (token_self) relative to total tokens (token_self + token_opp) and the available combined earning.\n\u2003\u2013 If the offered amount is lower than what is \u201cfair\u201d based on the token distribution, then the perceived utility is discounted. In contrast, if the offer exceeds the fairness reference, the utility is enhanced.\n\u2003\u2013 This \u201cscaling\u201d or amplification/attenuation of the nominal offer is captured multiplicatively.\n\n\u2022 Interaction of Mechanisms:\n\u2003\u2013 The fairness reference is calculated as:\n\u2003\u2003fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) \u00d7 combined_earning.\n\u2003\u2013 The ratio (split_self/fair_share) measures how the offer compares with what is fair.\n\u2003\u2013 Raising this ratio to a sensitivity parameter \u03b1 controls how strongly deviations from fairness affect the utility. If \u03b1 > 0, then offers below fairness reduce utility (ratio < 1 leads to a factor less than 1), and offers above fairness enhance it (ratio > 1 leads to a factor greater than 1).\n\u2003\u2013 Multiplying the nominal offer (split_self) by this scaling factor yields the overall utility.\n\n\u2022 Mathematical Form:\n\u2003\u2013 We choose a multiplicative gain function:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self \u00d7 (split_self/fair_share)^\u03b1.\n\u2003\u2013 This formulation is reference\u2010dependent, smooth and continuous, and uses only one learnable parameter, \u03b1.\n\n\u2022 Learnable Parameter:\n\u2003\u2013 \u03b1 is the sole learnable parameter that modulates the sensitivity to fairness. Finite bounds are set to ensure recovery (for example, \u03b1 in [0, 10]).\n\n\u2022 Mapping to Observable Behavior:\n\u2003\u2013 split_self is directly observed as the monetary offer.\n\u2003\u2013 The fairness reference is computed from token_self, token_opp, and combined_earning.\n\u2003\u2013 The model\u2019s output, U_accept, represents the subjective utility of accepting an offer.

  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n\u2022 Psychological Mechanisms:\n\u2003\u2013 The responder evaluates the offer (split_self) not only based on its nominal monetary value, but also by comparing it to a fairness reference. That fairness reference is derived from the participant\u2019s contribution (token_self) relative to total tokens (token_self + token_opp) and the available combined earning.\n\u2003\u2013 If the offered amount is lower than what is \u201cfair\u201d based on the token distribution, then the perceived utility is discounted. In contrast, if the offer exceeds the fairness reference, the utility is enhanced.\n\u2003\u2013 This \u201cscaling\u201d or amplification/attenuation of the nominal offer is captured multiplicatively.\n\n\u2022 Interaction of Mechanisms:\n\u2003\u2013 The fairness reference is calculated as:\n\u2003\u2003fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) \u00d7 combined_earning.\n\u2003\u2013 The ratio (split_self/fair_share) measures how the offer compares with what is fair.\n\u2003\u2013 Raising this ratio to a sensitivity parameter \u03b1 controls how strongly deviations from fairness affect the utility. If \u03b1 > 0, then offers below fairness reduce utility (ratio < 1 leads to a factor less than 1), and offers above fairness enhance it (ratio > 1 leads to a factor greater than 1).\n\u2003\u2013 Multiplying the nominal offer (split_self) by this scaling factor yields the overall utility.\n\n\u2022 Mathematical Form:\n\u2003\u2013 We choose a multiplicative gain function:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self \u00d7 (split_self/fair_share)^\u03b1.\n\u2003\u2013 This formulation is reference\u2010dependent, smooth and continuous, and uses only one learnable parameter, \u03b1.\n\n\u2022 Learnable Parameter:\n\u2003\u2013 \u03b1 is the sole learnable parameter that modulates the sensitivity to fairness. Finite bounds are set to ensure recovery (for example, \u03b1 in [0, 10]).\n\n\u2022 Mapping to Observable Behavior:\n\u2003\u2013 split_self is directly observed as the monetary offer.\n\u2003\u2013 The fairness reference is computed from token_self, token_opp, and combined_earning.\n\u2003\u2013 The model\u2019s output, U_accept, represents the subjective utility of accepting an offer. Lower utility (especially when split_self is below the fairness benchmark) makes acceptance less likely, in line with observed behavior.\n\nBelow is the formal mathematical model and the detailed variable descriptions.\n\n<MODEL>\nLet fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning  \nU_accept = split_self * (split_self / fair_share)^alpha\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility for accepting an offer, computed as the offered monetary amount scaled multiplicatively by the ratio of the offer to a fairness benchmark raised to the power alpha.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The proposed share for the participant (in \u00a3).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of tokens found by the participant.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of tokens found by the opponent.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"The total monetary earning in the trial (each token is worth \u00a33).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fairness sensitivity parameter governing the multiplicative adjustment in the utility function.
