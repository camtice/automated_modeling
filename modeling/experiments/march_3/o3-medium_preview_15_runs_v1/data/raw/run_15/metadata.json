If there are no previous models, start with one learnable parameter, then ensure the space of possible models is thoroughly explored with one parameter before moving to two parameters, etc.\n\nYour results will be scored on a combination of BIC with a penalization for number of learned parameters, the ability to recover those learned parameters, and the ability of those parameters to account for the differences in behaviors among varying groups of people.\n\nPrevious Models:\nModel 1:\nSpecification: U_accept = split_self - alpha * max(0, ( (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning - split_self ))\nSummary: The model computes the utility for a responder\u2019s acceptance decision by comparing the actual monetary offer to a fair share calculated from the participant's proportional contribution. If the offer falls short of this fair share, a penalty\u2014scaled by the inequity aversion parameter alpha\u2014is applied. The formulation captures a psychological sensitivity to disadvantageous inequity in a single-parameter specification.\nBIC: 34.61021336553505\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.922\nModel 2:\nSpecification: U_accept = split_self - alpha * max(0, (tau * (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) - split_self)\nSummary: A two-parameter utility model for responder behavior where utility is derived from the actual offer (split_self) reduced by a penalty applied when the offer falls short of a scaled fairness reference. The fairness reference is computed from the participant\u2019s token share of the total tokens multiplied by the combined earning, and is modulated by the fairness scaling parameter tau. The inequity aversion parameter alpha determines the sensitivity to deviations below the (tau-scaled) reference.\nBIC: 35.25002573222929\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.501\n- tau: r = 0.863\nModel 3:\nSpecification: U_accept = (1 - alpha) * split_self + alpha * (tau * ((token_self) / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning)\nSummary: This model posits that responders compute the utility of accepting an offer by balancing the actual monetary offer with an expected fair share derived from their token contribution. The model uses a convex combination of split_self and a scaled fairness reference, where alpha (0 to 1) determines the weighting of fairness relative to pure self-interest, and tau (0 to 10) scales the fairness reference.\nBIC: 45.67592971143451\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.456\n- tau: r = 0.592\nModel 4:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nThen:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = { split_self\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003if split_self \u2265 fair_share\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003   split_self \u2013 alpha \u00b7 (fair_share \u2013 split_self)\u00b2\u2003if split_self < fair_share }\nSummary: A piecewise utility model for responder behavior where the utility of accepting an offer equals the monetary amount offered, except when the offer falls below a fairness reference computed from the participant\u2019s token share of the total earning. In such cases, a quadratic penalty\u2014scaled by the learnable inequity sensitivity parameter alpha\u2014is applied, capturing an escalating aversion to receiving an unfair split.\nBIC: 33.91799996790353\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.875\nModel 5:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThen, the utility for accepting an offer is defined as:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self + tau * log((split_self + epsilon) / fair_share)\nSummary: A model of responder behavior where the utility for accepting an offer integrates the direct monetary benefit with a logarithmic fairness adjustment. The fairness reference is derived from the participant's token share of the combined earnings, and a single learnable parameter, tau, scales the impact of deviations from this fairness standard.\nBIC: 33.930812889198855\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau: r = 0.951\nModel 6:\nSpecification: U_accept = split_self - beta * ( max(0, (token_self/(token_self + token_opp))*combined_earning - split_self) )^(gamma)\nSummary: A utility model for responder behavior that computes a fairness reference based on token contributions and total earnings, then applies a non-linear penalty to offers falling short of this reference. The utility is the actual monetary offer (split_self) reduced by beta times the fairness shortfall raised to the power of gamma.\nModel 7:\nSpecification: U_accept = log(1 + split_self) - alpha * log(1 + max(0, ((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) - split_self))\nSummary: A reference-dependent utility model that applies logarithmic (diminishing) sensitivity to both the offered monetary amount and any shortfall relative to a fairness benchmark computed from token contributions. The single learnable parameter, alpha, scales the penalty for offers below the fairness reference.\nBIC: 37.49636326995195\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.916\nModel 8:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning  \nLet d = max(0, fair_share - split_self)  \nU_accept = split_self - alpha * d - tau * (d)^2\nSummary: A two-parameter utility model for responder decisions where the utility of accepting an offer is the proposed monetary share reduced by a penalty applied when the offer falls short of a fairness benchmark (derived from the participant\u2019s token contribution). The penalty is composed of a linear term and an additional quadratic term, capturing both the immediate sensitivity and the escalating aversion to unfair splits.\nBIC: 34.81986374486485\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.508\n- tau: r = 0.364\nModel 9:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThen:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self - tau * (split_self - fair_share)^2.\nSummary: The model calculates a fairness reference based on the token ratio multiplied by the combined earnings. It then derives the utility for accepting an offer by subtracting a quadratic penalty\u2014scaled by a single learnable parameter tau\u2014from the offered monetary amount. This symmetric penalty for any deviation from the fairness benchmark captures the responder's sensitivity to unfair splits.\nBIC: 34.25802432850235\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau: r = 0.770\nModel 10:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nU_accept = [ (1 - tau_param) * (split_self)^(rho_param) + tau_param * (fair_share)^(rho_param) ]^(1/rho_param)\nSummary: This model computes the utility for a responder\u2019s acceptance decision as a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) aggregator between the actual offered amount (split_self) and a fairness reference derived from token contributions (fair_share). Two learnable parameters govern the integration: tau_param sets the relative weight of fairness and rho_param controls the curvature of substitution between self-interest and fairness.\nBIC: 66.80233137460259\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau_param: r = 0.341\n- rho_param: r = 0.336\nModel 11:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\nLet shortfall = max(0, fair_share - split_self)\nLet surplus = max(0, split_self - fair_share)\nU_accept = ln(1 + split_self) - alpha * ln(1 + shortfall) - beta * ln(1 + surplus)\nSummary: This model computes the utility of accepting an offer by first establishing a fairness benchmark based on the participant's token share of total tokens and combined earnings. The utility is given by the log-transformed offered amount minus logarithmically scaled penalties for deviations from fairness. Two learnable parameters, alpha and beta, separately modulate sensitivity to receiving less than or more than the fairness benchmark.\nBIC: 40.96325099527113\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.870\n- beta: r = 0.519\nModel 12:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)) * combined_earning  \nLet d = split_self - fair_share  \nU_accept = split_self - alpha * ( log(1+exp(-d)) - log(2) ) + beta * ( log(1+exp(d)) - log(2) )\nSummary: A smooth, reference-dependent utility model in which the utility of accepting an offer is given by the monetary amount (split_self) adjusted by asymmetrically penalizing shortfalls and optionally rewarding surpluses relative to a fairness benchmark computed as the participant\u2019s token share of the total earnings. The adjustments are implemented using centered logarithmic transforms of the deviation, weighted by two learnable parameters (alpha and beta).\nBIC: 34.82214294286025\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.317\n- beta: r = 0.319\nModel 13:\nSpecification: fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\nrelative_short = max(0, fair_share - split_self) / fair_share\nU_accept = split_self * (1 - tau * relative_short)\nSummary: A reference-dependent utility model for responders that computes a fairness benchmark based on token contributions and combined earnings. When the monetary offer falls below this fairness standard, the utility is multiplicatively discounted by a factor proportional to the relative shortfall, scaled by the single fairness sensitivity parameter tau.\nBIC: 51.04425856409312\nParameter Recovery:\n- tau: r = 0.343\nModel 14:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning  \nU_accept = split_self * (split_self / fair_share)^alpha\nSummary: A one-parameter, multiplicative fairness adjustment model where the utility of accepting an offer equals the offered monetary amount scaled by the ratio of the offer to a fairness benchmark (computed from token contributions and combined earnings) raised to the power of the fairness sensitivity parameter alpha.\nBIC: 42.91428856572754\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.656",

No description of the model should be provided within the <MODEL> tags.\n\nThe parameter names you choose in your <VARIABLES> section will be used exactly as specified in subsequent code generation. Please choose clear, non-reserved parameter names that can be used directly in Python code. For example, avoid Python reserved words like 'lambda' and use alternatives like 'learning_rate' or 'lambda_param'. DO NOT USE 'lambda' AS A PARAMETER NAME.\n\nYou will be given the complete list of models that you have already created. Analyze the models, and notice the absence of possible explanations of behaviors that should be tested. You should start with simple obvious explanations, and as you notice these being thoroughly explored you should shift to fundamentally different models of behavior. Pay less attention to the names of the variables, and how they are actually interacting with the given behavioral data. If there are no previous models, start with one learnable parameter, then ensure the space of possible models is thoroughly explored with one parameter before moving to two parameters, etc.\n\nYour results will be scored on a combination of BIC with a penalization for number of learned parameters, the ability to recover those learned parameters, and the ability of those parameters to account for the differences in behaviors among varying groups of people.\n\nPrevious Models:\nModel 1:\nSpecification: U_accept = split_self - alpha * max(0, ( (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning - split_self ))\nSummary: The model computes the utility for a responder\u2019s acceptance decision by comparing the actual monetary offer to a fair share calculated from the participant's proportional contribution. If the offer falls short of this fair share, a penalty\u2014scaled by the inequity aversion parameter alpha\u2014is applied.

The utility is the actual monetary offer (split_self) reduced by beta times the fairness shortfall raised to the power of gamma.\nModel 7:\nSpecification: U_accept = log(1 + split_self) - alpha * log(1 + max(0, ((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) - split_self))\nSummary: A reference-dependent utility model that applies logarithmic (diminishing) sensitivity to both the offered monetary amount and any shortfall relative to a fairness benchmark computed from token contributions.

It then derives the utility for accepting an offer by subtracting a quadratic penalty\u2014scaled by a single learnable parameter tau\u2014from the offered monetary amount.

The utility is given by the log-transformed offered amount minus logarithmically scaled penalties for deviations from fairness.

      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Key psychological mechanisms: A responder\u2019s evaluation of an offer is driven not only by the monetary amount gained (self\u2010interest) but also by how fair the offer is relative to an expectation computed from their token contribution (fairness). When the offered amount (split_self) is lower than the fairness benchmark (fair_share), disutility (a penalty) is experienced, whereas offers above the fairness level might yield a bonus. However, the \u201cextra\u2010value\u201d of deviations from fairness tends to saturate, so a bounded function is desirable.\n\n2. Interaction of mechanisms: We compute a fairness reference (fair_share) as the proportion of the combined earnings that would be \u201cfair\u201d given the ratio of token_self to the sum of tokens. The deviation (difference d) between the observed split_self and the fair_share is then transformed via a saturating non\u2010linear function (tanh) so that large deviations no longer linearly exaggerate the utility differences. The overall utility is obtained by adding this adjusted fairness component to the raw monetary offer.\n\n3. Mathematical form: Using the hyperbolic tangent function on the deviation, we have\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self + tau * tanh(d)\nwith\u2003\u2003d = split_self \u2013 fair_share\nand\u2003\u2003fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThis form captures that near fairness (d \u2248 0), the utility is essentially the monetary gain, while gains or losses with respect to fairness are adjusted in a bounded manner.\n\n4. Learnable parameter: A single parameter tau modulates the sensitivity of the utility to deviations from fairness. A positive tau implies that offers below the fairness benchmark reduce utility (and offers above enhance it), with the effect saturating for large deviations. We impose finite bounds for tau (e.g., [-10, 10]).\n\n5. Mapping to behavior: The observed responder behavior (accepting an offer based on split_self) is predicted by the computed U_accept. Negative values indicate that the monetary offer, combined with fairness considerations, results in disutility (an offer tending to be rejected), whereas positive values represent beneficial acceptances.\n\nBelow is the formal specification.\n\n<MODEL>\nLet fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\nLet d = split_self - fair_share\nU_accept = split_self + tau * tanh(d)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Computed utility of accepting an offer, combining the monetary amount with a bounded fairness deviation term.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The monetary amount offered to the participant (in \u00a3).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of tokens found by the participant.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of tokens found by the opponent.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount earned by the group (in \u00a3); each token is worth \u00a33.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"fair_share\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fairness reference computed as the expected fair share, based on token contribution.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"d\": {\n      \"description\": \"Deviation of the offered share from the computed fairness reference.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"tau\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fairness sensitivity parameter that scales the influence of fairness deviation on utility.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {\"low\": -10, \"high\": 10}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nThe model computes the utility for accepting an offer as the monetary amount provided (split_self) adjusted by a fairness deviation term.

The fairness reference is derived from the participant\u2019s token share of the combined earnings. This deviation is transformed by a hyperbolic tangent function and then scaled by a single learnable parameter, tau, capturing both the bonus for favorable offers and the penalty for offers that fall below fairness.",
  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Key psychological mechanisms: A responder\u2019s evaluation of an offer is driven not only by the monetary amount gained (self\u2010interest) but also by how fair the offer is relative to an expectation computed from their token contribution (fairness). When the offered amount (split_self) is lower than the fairness benchmark (fair_share), disutility (a penalty) is experienced, whereas offers above the fairness level might yield a bonus. However, the \u201cextra\u2010value\u201d of deviations from fairness tends to saturate, so a bounded function is desirable.\n\n2. Interaction of mechanisms: We compute a fairness reference (fair_share) as the proportion of the combined earnings that would be \u201cfair\u201d given the ratio of token_self to the sum of tokens. The deviation (difference d) between the observed split_self and the fair_share is then transformed via a saturating non\u2010linear function (tanh) so that large deviations no longer linearly exaggerate the utility differences. The overall utility is obtained by adding this adjusted fairness component to the raw monetary offer.\n\n3. Mathematical form: Using the hyperbolic tangent function on the deviation, we have\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self + tau * tanh(d)\nwith\u2003\u2003d = split_self \u2013 fair_share\nand\u2003\u2003fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThis form captures that near fairness (d \u2248 0), the utility is essentially the monetary gain, while gains or losses with respect to fairness are adjusted in a bounded manner.\n\n4. Learnable parameter: A single parameter tau modulates the sensitivity of the utility to deviations from fairness. A positive tau implies that offers below the fairness benchmark reduce utility (and offers above enhance it), with the effect saturating for large deviations. We impose finite bounds for tau (e.g., [-10, 10]).\n\n5. Mapping to behavior: The observed responder behavior (accepting an offer based on split_self) is predicted by the computed U_accept. Negative values indicate that the monetary offer, combined with fairness considerations, results in disutility (an offer tending to be rejected), whereas positive values represent beneficial acceptances.\n\nBelow is the formal specification.\n\n<MODEL>\nLet fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\nLet d = split_self - fair_share\nU_accept = split_self + tau * tanh(d)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Computed utility of accepting an offer, combining the monetary amount with a bounded fairness deviation term.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The monetary amount offered to the participant (in \u00a3).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of tokens found by the participant.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of tokens found by the opponent.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount earned by the group (in \u00a3); each token is worth \u00a33.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"fair_share\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fairness reference computed as the expected fair share, based on token contribution.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"d\": {\n      \"description\": \"Deviation of the offered share from the computed fairness reference.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"tau\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fairness sensitivity parameter that scales the influence of fairness deviation on utility.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": -10,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {\"low\": -10, \"high\": 10}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nThe model computes the utility for accepting an offer as the monetary amount provided (split_self) adjusted by a fairness deviation term.
