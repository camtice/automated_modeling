For example, tau > 1 might indicate that the ideal share is perceived as higher than the strict proportional share, whereas tau < 1 might indicate a lower fairness expectation.\n\n\u2022 Mathematical Form:\n\u2003\u2013 The utility for accepting an offer (U_accept) is expressed as a convex combination of the actual offer (split_self) and a scaled fair share (tau multiplied by the proportional fair share based on tokens).\n\u2003\u2013 Formulation: U_accept = (1 \u2013 alpha)*split_self + alpha*(tau*(token_self/(token_self+token_opp))*combined_earning)\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 If alpha = 0, the decision is based solely on the money offered.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 If alpha = 1, the decision is based solely on the fair share (with tau scaling applied).\n\n\u2022 Parameters:\n\u2003\u2013 alpha: Weight parameter that balances self-interest and fairness. It is bounded between 0 and 1.\n\u2003\u2013 tau: Scaling parameter that adjusts the fairness reference. Its generous bounds are from 0 to 10.\n\n\u2022 Mapping to Observables:\n\u2003\u2013 The model uses observable split_self, token_self, token_opp, and combined_earning from the dataset.\n\u2003\u2013 The computed U_accept (utility) informs later the probability of accepting an offer (after applying a temperature parameter, not included here).\n\nBelow is our formal specification:\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = (1 - alpha) * split_self + alpha * (tau * ((token_self) / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer, as a weighted combination of the monetary offer and the scaled fairness reference.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight parameter that determines the influence of the fairness reference relative to the monetary offer (0 implies pure self-interest, 1 implies pure fairness sensitivity).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"tau\": {\n      \"description\": \"Scaling parameter for the fairness reference, modulating the perception of what constitutes a fair share.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 10.0,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The offered monetary share for the participant in the trial.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of tokens found by the participant; used to compute the fair share.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of tokens found by the opponent; used together with token_self to compute the fair share.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money available, computed from tokens found.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nThis model posits that responders compute the utility of accepting an offer by balancing the actual monetary offer with an expected fair share derived from their token contribution.

The model uses a convex combination of split_self and a scaled fairness reference, where alpha (0 to 1) determines the weighting of fairness relative to pure self-interest, and tau (0 to 10) scales the fairness reference.\nBIC: 45.67592971143451\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.456\n- tau: r = 0.592"
