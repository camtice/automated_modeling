      "output": "Step by Step Reasoning:\n1. Key psychological mechanisms:\n   \u2022 A responder\u2019s evaluation of an offer appears to depend on comparing the actual monetary offer (split_self) to an internally computed fairness reference.\n   \u2022 The fairness reference is based on the participant\u2019s relative contribution (token_self vs. token_opp) to a shared earning. When the offer falls below this reference, the responder experiences a penalty.\n   \u2022 The degree of dissatisfaction or \u201cinequity aversion\u201d may grow more than linearly with the deviation from fairness; therefore, a quadratic penalty mechanism is introduced.\n\n2. How these mechanisms interact:\n   \u2022 First, compute a fairness reference (fair_share) as a proportional split of the combined earnings based on the participant\u2019s token contribution relative to the total tokens.\n   \u2022 Compare the actual offer (split_self) to the fairness reference. If the offer meets or exceeds the reference, the utility remains equal to the monetary amount offered. If the offer is below the reference, a penalty is subtracted which grows as the square of the deviation, scaled by a learnable inequity penalty parameter.\n\n3. Mathematical form to capture interactions:\n   \u2022 The model uses a piecewise function: when split_self \u2265 fair_share the utility equals split_self; when split_self < fair_share it equals split_self minus a quadratic penalty term \u03b1 \u00b7 (fair_share \u2212 split_self)\u00b2.\n   \n4. Parameters needed:\n   \u2022 A single learnable parameter, alpha, representing the strength of the quadratic penalty for offers falling below the fairness reference. Its bounds can be set generously, for example between 0 and 10.\n\n5.

  "full_reasoning": "Step by Step Reasoning:\n1. Key psychological mechanisms:\n   \u2022 A responder\u2019s evaluation of an offer appears to depend on comparing the actual monetary offer (split_self) to an internally computed fairness reference.\n   \u2022 The fairness reference is based on the participant\u2019s relative contribution (token_self vs. token_opp) to a shared earning. When the offer falls below this reference, the responder experiences a penalty.\n   \u2022 The degree of dissatisfaction or \u201cinequity aversion\u201d may grow more than linearly with the deviation from fairness; therefore, a quadratic penalty mechanism is introduced.\n\n2. How these mechanisms interact:\n   \u2022 First, compute a fairness reference (fair_share) as a proportional split of the combined earnings based on the participant\u2019s token contribution relative to the total tokens.\n   \u2022 Compare the actual offer (split_self) to the fairness reference. If the offer meets or exceeds the reference, the utility remains equal to the monetary amount offered. If the offer is below the reference, a penalty is subtracted which grows as the square of the deviation, scaled by a learnable inequity penalty parameter.\n\n3. Mathematical form to capture interactions:\n   \u2022 The model uses a piecewise function: when split_self \u2265 fair_share the utility equals split_self; when split_self < fair_share it equals split_self minus a quadratic penalty term \u03b1 \u00b7 (fair_share \u2212 split_self)\u00b2.\n   \n4. Parameters needed:\n   \u2022 A single learnable parameter, alpha, representing the strength of the quadratic penalty for offers falling below the fairness reference. Its bounds can be set generously, for example between 0 and 10.\n\n5.
