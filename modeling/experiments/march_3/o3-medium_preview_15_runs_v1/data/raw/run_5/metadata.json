      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Key psychological mechanism: Responders are sensitive not only to the absolute monetary payoff (split_self) they receive but also to how fair that payoff is in relation to what they perceive as their fair share. Their perceived fair share is calculated from their contribution (token_self) relative to the total tokens (token_self + token_opp) multiplied by the total combined earning.\n\n2. Interaction of mechanisms: The model assumes that responders derive utility from the monetary amount offered (split_self), but any deviation from the fairness reference has a nonlinear (logarithmic) effect on utility. When the offer is less than the fair share, the log term is negative and reduces the overall utility, capturing the disutility for unfairness. When the offer exceeds the fair share, the log term becomes positive and enhances the utility. The logarithmic function is chosen to capture diminishing sensitivity to deviations from fairness.\n\n3. Mathematical form: Let fair_share be defined as:\n\u2003\u2003fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThe utility of accepting an offer is modeled as:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self + tau * log((split_self + epsilon) / fair_share),\nwhere epsilon is a small constant to ensure the log is defined when split_self is zero. Here, tau is the learnable parameter that scales the impact of fairness evaluation relative to the monetary amount.\n\n4. Parameter calibration: The only learnable parameter, tau, is allowed to vary over a generous finite interval. A positive tau implies that offers below the fair share lead to decreasing utility while offers above lead to increasing utility. If tau is negative, this would produce the opposite pattern, a possibility that can be ruled out or confirmed by data. The lower and upper bounds for tau are set as \u221210 and 10, which are generous enough to capture a wide range of sensitivities.\n\n5. Mapping to observable behavior: For each trial, the utility (U_accept) computed by the model depends on the actual offer (split_self) and the fairness reference based on tokens and combined earning.

The fairness reference is derived from the participant's token share of the combined earnings, and a single learnable parameter, tau, scales the impact of deviations from this fairness standard.",
  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Key psychological mechanism: Responders are sensitive not only to the absolute monetary payoff (split_self) they receive but also to how fair that payoff is in relation to what they perceive as their fair share. Their perceived fair share is calculated from their contribution (token_self) relative to the total tokens (token_self + token_opp) multiplied by the total combined earning.\n\n2. Interaction of mechanisms: The model assumes that responders derive utility from the monetary amount offered (split_self), but any deviation from the fairness reference has a nonlinear (logarithmic) effect on utility. When the offer is less than the fair share, the log term is negative and reduces the overall utility, capturing the disutility for unfairness. When the offer exceeds the fair share, the log term becomes positive and enhances the utility. The logarithmic function is chosen to capture diminishing sensitivity to deviations from fairness.\n\n3. Mathematical form: Let fair_share be defined as:\n\u2003\u2003fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThe utility of accepting an offer is modeled as:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self + tau * log((split_self + epsilon) / fair_share),\nwhere epsilon is a small constant to ensure the log is defined when split_self is zero. Here, tau is the learnable parameter that scales the impact of fairness evaluation relative to the monetary amount.\n\n4. Parameter calibration: The only learnable parameter, tau, is allowed to vary over a generous finite interval. A positive tau implies that offers below the fair share lead to decreasing utility while offers above lead to increasing utility. If tau is negative, this would produce the opposite pattern, a possibility that can be ruled out or confirmed by data. The lower and upper bounds for tau are set as \u221210 and 10, which are generous enough to capture a wide range of sensitivities.\n\n5. Mapping to observable behavior: For each trial, the utility (U_accept) computed by the model depends on the actual offer (split_self) and the fairness reference based on tokens and combined earning.
