The utility is the actual monetary offer (split_self) reduced by beta times the fairness shortfall raised to the power of gamma.\nModel 7:\nSpecification: U_accept = log(1 + split_self) - alpha * log(1 + max(0, ((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) - split_self))\nSummary: A reference-dependent utility model that applies logarithmic (diminishing) sensitivity to both the offered monetary amount and any shortfall relative to a fairness benchmark computed from token contributions. The single learnable parameter, alpha, scales the penalty for offers below the fairness reference.\nBIC: 37.49636326995195\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.916\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions.",
      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Key Psychological Mechanisms:\n\u2003\u2022 Responders are assumed to compare the monetary offer they receive (split_self) against a reference fair share. This fair share is derived from their token contribution relative to the total tokens (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)) and the combined earnings.\n\u2003\u2022 When the offer is below this fairness benchmark, responders experience a \u201cfairness penalty.\u201d Unlike models with only a linear penalty, it is plausible that small deviations are penalized proportionally while larger inequities are punished more steeply.\n\u2003\u2022 Thus, both a linear sensitivity (\u03b1) and an escalating, quadratic sensitivity (\u03c4) would be invoked when the offer is below the fairness benchmark.\n\n2. Mechanism Interactions:\n\u2003\u2022 The fair share is computed as the ratio of token_self to the sum of tokens multiplied by the total pot (combined_earning).\n\u2003\u2022 The shortfall is defined as the positive difference (when any) between the fair share and the monetary offer.\n\u2003\u2022 The utility for accepting an offer is the received amount diminished by a penalty that consists of a linear term in the shortfall (scaled by \u03b1) and a quadratic term in the shortfall (scaled by \u03c4).\n\n3. Mathematical form:\n\u2003\u2022 Define fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) \u00d7 combined_earning.\n\u2003\u2022 Define the shortfall d = max(0, fair_share \u2013 split_self).\n\u2003\u2022 Then, the utility is given by the sum of the offer minus the combined penalties:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self \u2013 \u03b1\u00b7d \u2013 \u03c4\u00b7d\u00b2\n\n4. Parameters:\n\u2003\u2022 \u03b1 (alpha): Represents the linear sensitivity to fairness deviations.\n\u2003\u2022 \u03c4 (tau): Represents the additional quadratic sensitivity capturing escalating fairness concerns.\n\u2003Both parameters are learnable with generous bounds provided.\n\n5. Mapping to Observables:\n\u2003\u2022 split_self, token_self, token_opp, and combined_earning are observed in the data.\n\u2003\u2022 The computed variable fair_share is derived directly from token_self, token_opp, and combined_earning.\n\u2003\u2022 The resultant utility U_accept is used to estimate the propensity to accept an offer (with subsequent transformation by a temperature parameter outside this model).\n\nBelow is the formal specification.\n\n<MODEL>\nLet fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning  \nLet d = max(0, fair_share - split_self)  \nU_accept = split_self - alpha * d - tau * (d)^2\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting an offer, combining the monetary gain and a fairness penalty for receiving less than the fair share.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The monetary share proposed for the participant (in \u00a3).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of tokens found by the participant, determining their contribution.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of tokens found by the opponent, used in computing the fair share.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money earned (in \u00a3); each token contributes \u00a33.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"fair_share\": {\n      \"description\": \"The fairness benchmark computed as the participant\u2019s proportional contribution times the combined earning.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"d\": {\n      \"description\": \"The positive deviation (if any) between the fairness benchmark and the monetary offer.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Learnable linear sensitivity parameter that scales the penalty for fairness shortfall.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"tau\": {\n      \"description\": \"Learnable quadratic sensitivity parameter that captures the escalating loss in utility due to increasing fairness shortfall.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA two-parameter utility model for responder decisions where the utility of accepting an offer is the proposed monetary share reduced by a penalty applied when the offer falls short of a fairness benchmark (derived from the participant\u2019s token contribution).

  "model_summary": "A two-parameter utility model for responder decisions where the utility of accepting an offer is the proposed monetary share reduced by a penalty applied when the offer falls short of a fairness benchmark (derived from the participant\u2019s token contribution). The penalty is composed of a linear term and an additional quadratic term, capturing both the immediate sensitivity and the escalating aversion to unfair splits.",
  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Key Psychological Mechanisms:\n\u2003\u2022 Responders are assumed to compare the monetary offer they receive (split_self) against a reference fair share. This fair share is derived from their token contribution relative to the total tokens (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)) and the combined earnings.\n\u2003\u2022 When the offer is below this fairness benchmark, responders experience a \u201cfairness penalty.\u201d Unlike models with only a linear penalty, it is plausible that small deviations are penalized proportionally while larger inequities are punished more steeply.\n\u2003\u2022 Thus, both a linear sensitivity (\u03b1) and an escalating, quadratic sensitivity (\u03c4) would be invoked when the offer is below the fairness benchmark.\n\n2. Mechanism Interactions:\n\u2003\u2022 The fair share is computed as the ratio of token_self to the sum of tokens multiplied by the total pot (combined_earning).\n\u2003\u2022 The shortfall is defined as the positive difference (when any) between the fair share and the monetary offer.\n\u2003\u2022 The utility for accepting an offer is the received amount diminished by a penalty that consists of a linear term in the shortfall (scaled by \u03b1) and a quadratic term in the shortfall (scaled by \u03c4).\n\n3. Mathematical form:\n\u2003\u2022 Define fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) \u00d7 combined_earning.\n\u2003\u2022 Define the shortfall d = max(0, fair_share \u2013 split_self).\n\u2003\u2022 Then, the utility is given by the sum of the offer minus the combined penalties:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self \u2013 \u03b1\u00b7d \u2013 \u03c4\u00b7d\u00b2\n\n4. Parameters:\n\u2003\u2022 \u03b1 (alpha): Represents the linear sensitivity to fairness deviations.\n\u2003\u2022 \u03c4 (tau): Represents the additional quadratic sensitivity capturing escalating fairness concerns.\n\u2003Both parameters are learnable with generous bounds provided.\n\n5. Mapping to Observables:\n\u2003\u2022 split_self, token_self, token_opp, and combined_earning are observed in the data.\n\u2003\u2022 The computed variable fair_share is derived directly from token_self, token_opp, and combined_earning.\n\u2003\u2022 The resultant utility U_accept is used to estimate the propensity to accept an offer (with subsequent transformation by a temperature parameter outside this model).\n\nBelow is the formal specification.\n\n<MODEL>\nLet fair_share = (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning  \nLet d = max(0, fair_share - split_self)  \nU_accept = split_self - alpha * d - tau * (d)^2\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting an offer, combining the monetary gain and a fairness penalty for receiving less than the fair share.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The monetary share proposed for the participant (in \u00a3).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of tokens found by the participant, determining their contribution.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"The number of tokens found by the opponent, used in computing the fair share.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total amount of money earned (in \u00a3); each token contributes \u00a33.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"fair_share\": {\n      \"description\": \"The fairness benchmark computed as the participant\u2019s proportional contribution times the combined earning.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"d\": {\n      \"description\": \"The positive deviation (if any) between the fairness benchmark and the monetary offer.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Learnable linear sensitivity parameter that scales the penalty for fairness shortfall.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"tau\": {\n      \"description\": \"Learnable quadratic sensitivity parameter that captures the escalating loss in utility due to increasing fairness shortfall.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA two-parameter utility model for responder decisions where the utility of accepting an offer is the proposed monetary share reduced by a penalty applied when the offer falls short of a fairness benchmark (derived from the participant\u2019s token contribution).
