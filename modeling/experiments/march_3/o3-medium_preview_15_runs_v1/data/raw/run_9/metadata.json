The model uses a convex combination of split_self and a scaled fairness reference, where alpha (0 to 1) determines the weighting of fairness relative to pure self-interest, and tau (0 to 10) scales the fairness reference.\nBIC: 45.67592971143451\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.456\n- tau: r = 0.592\nModel 4:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nThen:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = { split_self\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003if split_self \u2265 fair_share\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003   split_self \u2013 alpha \u00b7 (fair_share \u2013 split_self)\u00b2\u2003if split_self < fair_share }\nSummary: A piecewise utility model for responder behavior where the utility of accepting an offer equals the monetary amount offered, except when the offer falls below a fairness reference computed from the participant\u2019s token share of the total earning. In such cases, a quadratic penalty\u2014scaled by the learnable inequity sensitivity parameter alpha\u2014is applied, capturing an escalating aversion to receiving an unfair split.\nBIC: 33.91799996790353\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.875\nModel 5:\nSpecification: Let fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThen, the utility for accepting an offer is defined as:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self + tau * log((split_self + epsilon) / fair_share)\nSummary: A model of responder behavior where the utility for accepting an offer integrates the direct monetary benefit with a logarithmic fairness adjustment.

The utility is the actual monetary offer (split_self) reduced by beta times the fairness shortfall raised to the power of gamma.\nModel 7:\nSpecification: U_accept = log(1 + split_self) - alpha * log(1 + max(0, ((token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning) - split_self))\nSummary: A reference-dependent utility model that applies logarithmic (diminishing) sensitivity to both the offered monetary amount and any shortfall relative to a fairness benchmark computed from token contributions.

The penalty is composed of a linear term and an additional quadratic term, capturing both the immediate sensitivity and the escalating aversion to unfair splits.\nBIC: 34.81986374486485\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.508\n- tau: r = 0.364\n\nPlease think through this step by step, then provide your model specification and variable descriptions.",

Thus, the utility is given as:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self \u2013 tau \u00b7 (split_self \u2013 fair_share)\u00b2.\n\u2003\u2022 This formulation places all the model\u2019s \u201clearnable\u201d weight on tau, with split_self and fair_share coming directly from the data.\n\n4. Calibration Parameter:\n\u2003\u2022 tau (with finite numerical bounds) is the sole learnable parameter, constrained for example between 0 (no sensitivity to fairness deviation) and 10 (a relatively generous upper bound).\n\u2003\u2022 The mapping is straightforward: for a given trial, the model uses token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, and split_self (all observable) to compute the fairness reference and the corresponding utility.\n\n5. Mapping to Observed Behavior:\n\u2003\u2022 The computed U_accept serves as the basis for later transforming into a choice probability (via, e.g., a softmax with an added temperature parameter, which is handled externally).\n\u2003\u2022 Negative values of U_accept indicate offers that are sufficiently unfair (from the responder\u2019s viewpoint) and hence unlikely to be accepted.\n\nThe final formal specification is given below.\n\n<MODEL>\nLet fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.\nThen:\n\u2003\u2003U_accept = split_self - tau * (split_self - fair_share)^2.\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the monetary offer, computed as the offered amount reduced by the quadratic penalty for deviation from a fairness reference.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": false,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Monetary amount offered to the participant (in \u00a3).\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant; used to compute the fairness reference.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent; used to compute the fairness reference.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"Total monetary amount available (in \u00a3) calculated from token earnings.\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"tau\": {\n      \"description\": \"Fairness sensitivity parameter controlling the quadratic penalty for any deviation from the fair share.
