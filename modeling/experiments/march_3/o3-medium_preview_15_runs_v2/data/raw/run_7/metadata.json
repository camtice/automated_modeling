      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Key psychological mechanisms: For responders in fairness-related decision tasks, a central mechanism is inequity aversion. Participants compare the monetary offer (split_self) with the \u201cfair\u201d share they believe they deserve given their contribution (token_self relative to token_opp). When the offer is below this fairness standard, a penalty is incurred. There is also a possibility of penalizing offers that are above the fair share (overly generous offers) if one is uncomfortable with deviations from equality\u2014though typically the negative reaction is stronger for disadvantageous inequity.\n\n2. Mechanism interactions: The fair share is computed based on relative contributions, using token_self and token_opp together with the combined_earning. The offer\u2019s deviation from this fair share drives a correction of utility. Two penalties (or modifications) are possible:\n   \u2022 A penalty when the offered share is less than the fair share (disadvantageous inequity; governed by the parameter alpha).\n   \u2022 A penalty (or reduced additional gain) when the offered share exceeds the fair share (advantageous inequity; governed by the parameter beta).\n\n3. Mathematical form: We define the fair share as \n\u2003\u2003fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) \u00d7 combined_earning.\nThe deviation from fairness is computed as the difference between the offer (split_self) and fair_share. Two \u201cmax\u201d functions are used to partition the deviation into negative (if split_self is lower) and positive (if split_self is higher) parts. The overall utility is then the offered amount corrected by these penalties.\n\n4. Learnable parameters: The model uses two learnable parameters:\n   \u2022 alpha: sensitivity to disadvantageous inequity (penalty when the offer is below the fair share).\n   \u2022 beta: sensitivity to advantageous inequity (penalty when the offer is above the fair share).\nBoth parameters have finite generous bounds.\n\n5. Mapping to observable behavior: Each trial provides the participant\u2019s token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, and the offer split_self. The fair_share is computed based on token contributions and combined_earning. The utility computed by the model reflects the net benefit of accepting an offer after accounting for deviations from fairness. This utility will be used later (with a temperature parameter) to generate choice probabilities.\n\nBelow is the formal specification:\n\n<MODEL>\nLet \n\u2003\u2003fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) \u00d7 combined_earning.\nThen, the utility of accepting an offer is computed as:\n\u2003\u2003U = split_self \u2212 alpha \u00d7 max(fair_share \u2212 split_self, 0) \u2212 beta \u00d7 max(split_self \u2212 fair_share, 0).\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer, combining monetary gain and fairness deviations\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The proposed share for the participant (in \u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"The total amount of money earned (in \u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant (reflecting their contribution)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent (reflecting opponent's contribution)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"fair_share\": {\n      \"description\": \"The fair monetary share for the participant based on token contributions\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Learnable sensitivity to disadvantageous inequity (penalty when offer is below fair share)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Learnable sensitivity to advantageous inequity (penalty when offer exceeds fair share)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA fairness-based utility model for responder behavior where the fair share is determined by the participant\u2019s contribution relative to the opponent.

The utility of accepting an offer is the monetary gain (split_self) decreased by penalties for deviating from the fair share. Two learnable parameters, alpha and beta, modulate the sensitivity to disadvantageous and advantageous inequity, respectively.",
  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Key psychological mechanisms: For responders in fairness-related decision tasks, a central mechanism is inequity aversion. Participants compare the monetary offer (split_self) with the \u201cfair\u201d share they believe they deserve given their contribution (token_self relative to token_opp). When the offer is below this fairness standard, a penalty is incurred. There is also a possibility of penalizing offers that are above the fair share (overly generous offers) if one is uncomfortable with deviations from equality\u2014though typically the negative reaction is stronger for disadvantageous inequity.\n\n2. Mechanism interactions: The fair share is computed based on relative contributions, using token_self and token_opp together with the combined_earning. The offer\u2019s deviation from this fair share drives a correction of utility. Two penalties (or modifications) are possible:\n   \u2022 A penalty when the offered share is less than the fair share (disadvantageous inequity; governed by the parameter alpha).\n   \u2022 A penalty (or reduced additional gain) when the offered share exceeds the fair share (advantageous inequity; governed by the parameter beta).\n\n3. Mathematical form: We define the fair share as \n\u2003\u2003fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) \u00d7 combined_earning.\nThe deviation from fairness is computed as the difference between the offer (split_self) and fair_share. Two \u201cmax\u201d functions are used to partition the deviation into negative (if split_self is lower) and positive (if split_self is higher) parts. The overall utility is then the offered amount corrected by these penalties.\n\n4. Learnable parameters: The model uses two learnable parameters:\n   \u2022 alpha: sensitivity to disadvantageous inequity (penalty when the offer is below the fair share).\n   \u2022 beta: sensitivity to advantageous inequity (penalty when the offer is above the fair share).\nBoth parameters have finite generous bounds.\n\n5. Mapping to observable behavior: Each trial provides the participant\u2019s token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, and the offer split_self. The fair_share is computed based on token contributions and combined_earning. The utility computed by the model reflects the net benefit of accepting an offer after accounting for deviations from fairness. This utility will be used later (with a temperature parameter) to generate choice probabilities.\n\nBelow is the formal specification:\n\n<MODEL>\nLet \n\u2003\u2003fair_share = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) \u00d7 combined_earning.\nThen, the utility of accepting an offer is computed as:\n\u2003\u2003U = split_self \u2212 alpha \u00d7 max(fair_share \u2212 split_self, 0) \u2212 beta \u00d7 max(split_self \u2212 fair_share, 0).\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer, combining monetary gain and fairness deviations\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The proposed share for the participant (in \u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"combined_earning\": {\n      \"description\": \"The total amount of money earned (in \u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant (reflecting their contribution)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent (reflecting opponent's contribution)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"fair_share\": {\n      \"description\": \"The fair monetary share for the participant based on token contributions\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Learnable sensitivity to disadvantageous inequity (penalty when offer is below fair share)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Learnable sensitivity to advantageous inequity (penalty when offer exceeds fair share)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA fairness-based utility model for responder behavior where the fair share is determined by the participant\u2019s contribution relative to the opponent.

The utility of accepting an offer is the monetary gain (split_self) decreased by penalties for deviating from the fair share. Two learnable parameters, alpha and beta, modulate the sensitivity to disadvantageous and advantageous inequity, respectively.\nBIC: 35.00456495888595\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.929\n- beta: r = 0.644"
