      "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts the utility of accepting an offer for the responder in the given experiment. The model needs to be based on psychological principles, have no more than two learnable parameters, and avoid high covariance between parameters for good parameter recovery.\n\nFirst, looking at the previous models, they all combine absolute monetary gain (split_self) with some form of fairness consideration. Model 1 uses proportional fairness based on token contributions, Model 2 uses a direct comparison to the participant's contribution (3*token_self), and Model 3 uses a proportional deviation from that contribution. The BIC scores suggest that Model 2 performs better, possibly because it's simpler and has better parameter recovery.\n\nNow, considering psychological principles, fairness and self-interest are key. People might compare the offer to what they contributed (equity theory) and also consider the relative split compared to the opponent. Another angle is the concept of inequity aversion, where people dislike unequal outcomes. However, the previous models already cover contribution-based fairness. Maybe there's another aspect, like the difference between what the responder gets and what the proposer keeps. For example, if the proposer is keeping a lot more, that might feel unfair even if the responder's share is above their contribution.\n\nWait, the dataset includes split_opp (the opponent's proposed share) and split_self. When the participant is the responder, the proposer is the opponent. So, the split_opp is what the proposer is keeping, and split_self is what they're offering. The combined_earning is split_opp + split_self. So, the responder's utility might depend not just on their own share but also on how much the proposer is keeping relative to their own contribution.\n\nAnother variable is trial_type, which indicates whether contributions are equal, opponent more, or participant more. This might influence fairness perceptions. For example, if the opponent contributed more, maybe the responder expects a lower share. But trial_type is categorical, so integrating it into a continuous utility model might be tricky. Maybe instead, the model should consider the difference in contributions (token_self vs. token_opp) and how the split compares to that.\n\nThe token_self and token_opp variables represent each party's contribution. Each token is worth \u00a33, so the participant's contribution is 3*token_self, and the opponent's is 3*token_opp. The total combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). The equitable split would be proportional to contributions. So, the fair share for the participant would be (3*token_self / combined_earning)*100%, but the splitperc_self is given as a percentage. \n\nBut previous models have used the difference between the actual split and the equitable split. Maybe another approach is to consider the difference between the proposed split and the equitable split in absolute terms (like Model 2) or relative terms (like Model 3). However, the previous models have already explored these. To come up with a new model, perhaps we need to look at the ratio between the proposed split and the equitable split. For example, if the proposed split is less than the equitable split, the utility decreases.\n\nAlternatively, the model could incorporate the proposer's share relative to their contribution. For instance, if the proposer is keeping a share that's more than their contribution, that might be seen as unfair. So, the responder's utility could depend on both their own share compared to their contribution and the proposer's share compared to theirs.\n\nLet me formalize this. Suppose the equitable split for the participant is 3*token_self, and for the proposer is 3*token_opp. The proposed split for the participant is split_self, and the proposer keeps split_opp. The fair split would be split_self = 3*token_self and split_opp = 3*token_opp. But in reality, split_self + split_opp = combined_earning = 3*(token_self + token_opp). So, any deviation from the equitable split would mean one party is getting more than their contribution.\n\nThe utility could then be a function of how much the participant's share exceeds their contribution and how much the proposer's share exceeds theirs. For example, if the participant's share is split_self - 3*token_self (their gain over contribution) and the proposer's is split_opp - 3*token_opp. Inequity aversion would suggest that the responder dislikes when the proposer gets more than their fair share, even if the responder's share is fair. \n\nBut since split_opp = combined_earning - split_self, we can express everything in terms of split_self. Let's see:\n\nsplit_opp = 3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self.\n\nThe proposer's excess is split_opp - 3*token_opp = [3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self] - 3*token_opp = 3*token_self - split_self.\n\nWait, that's interesting. The proposer's excess is 3*token_self - split_self. So, if split_self is less than 3*token_self, the proposer is keeping more than their contribution. So, the proposer's excess is (split_opp - 3*token_opp) = (combined_earning - split_self) - 3*token_opp = 3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self - 3*token_opp = 3*token_self - split_self. \n\nSo, the proposer's excess is 3*token_self - split_self. If split_self is less than 3*token_self, the proposer is getting more than their contribution. The responder's excess is split_self - 3*token_self. \n\nSo, the utility could be a combination of the responder's own gain (split_self - 3*token_self) and the proposer's gain (3*token_self - split_self). But since these are opposites (if one is positive, the other is negative), maybe the model should consider both terms. For example, the responder might dislike when the proposer gains more than their contribution, even if the responder's share is fair. \n\nThis is similar to inequity aversion models where people dislike inequality, whether it's advantageous or disadvantageous. But in this case, since the responder can only accept or reject, maybe they are more sensitive to disadvantageous inequality. \n\nSo, the utility could be:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * max(0, (3*token_self - split_self) - (split_self - 3*token_self)) )\n\nWait, that might not be right. Alternatively, the responder's utility could decrease if the proposer's excess is positive. So, the utility could be:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self - \u03b2 * (3*token_self - split_self)\n\nBut 3*token_self - split_self is the proposer's excess. If split_self is less than 3*token_self, then the proposer is keeping more than their contribution, which might be seen as unfair. So, the responder's utility would decrease by \u03b2 multiplied by that excess. \n\nAlternatively, the model could be:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (split_self - (3*token_self - split_opp))\n\nWait, split_opp is the proposer's share. But split_opp = combined_earning - split_self. So, split_opp = 3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self. \n\nBut maybe the key is to compare the split_self to the equitable split (3*token_self) and also compare the split_opp to the proposer's equitable split (3*token_opp). The difference between split_self and 3*token_self is the responder's gain/loss, and split_opp - 3*token_opp is the proposer's gain/loss. Inequity aversion would suggest that the responder dislikes when the proposer's gain is higher than theirs. \n\nA standard inequity aversion model (like Fehr & Schmidt, 1999) has utility as:\n\nU = x - \u03b1 * max(y - x, 0) - \u03b2 * max(x - y, 0)\n\nwhere x is own payoff, y is other's payoff. But in this case, the responder's payoff is split_self if accepted, and possibly zero if rejected. But the model should only consider the utility of accepting. So, x = split_self, y = split_opp. \n\nBut according to Fehr & Schmidt, the utility would be:\n\nU_accept = split_self - \u03b1 * max(split_opp - split_self, 0) - \u03b2 * max(split_self - split_opp, 0)\n\nBut this model has two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2, which are the aversion to disadvantageous and advantageous inequality, respectively. However, the problem states that the model should have no more than two learnable parameters. Since the previous models used two parameters, maybe this is acceptable. However, the task says to not include parameters for general stochasticity, but here \u03b1 and \u03b2 are part of the utility function. \n\nBut the problem specifies that the model should predict only responder behavior and build on psychological principles. Inequity aversion is a well-established principle. However, in the previous models, the focus was on contribution-based fairness. Using an inequity aversion model that compares payoffs directly (split_self vs split_opp) could be a different approach not yet explored in the previous models. \n\nBut let's check the previous models. Model 1 uses splitperc_self vs equitable percentage. Model 2 uses split_self vs 3*token_self. Model 3 uses proportional deviation from 3*token_self. None of them directly compare the split_self and split_opp. So, this would be a new model. \n\nSo, the utility could be:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self - \u03b2 * (split_opp - split_self) if split_opp > split_self\n\nBut this is a piecewise function. Alternatively, using the Fehr & Schmidt model:\n\nU_accept = split_self - \u03b1 * max(split_opp - split_self, 0) - \u03b2 * max(split_self - split_opp, 0)\n\nBut this has two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2. However, the problem allows up to two parameters. But the task says the model should have no more than two learnable parameters. So, this is acceptable. However, in the context of responder behavior, when the responder is deciding to accept or reject, advantageous inequality (split_self > split_opp) might be less relevant, as responders are more concerned with being treated fairly (disadvantageous inequality). So, maybe \u03b2 can be set to zero, but that would reduce the model to one parameter. Alternatively, include both, but that uses two parameters. \n\nBut looking at the previous models, they all have two parameters. So, introducing a model with two parameters (\u03b1 and \u03b2) for inequity aversion would be a new direction. However, the problem states that the model should not include parameters for general stochasticity, but these are part of the utility function, so that's okay. \n\nBut wait, the task says the model should not include parameters to simulate general stochasticity because that will be handled later by a temperature parameter. So, the parameters here should be part of the utility calculation, not the noise. \n\nSo, proceeding with the Fehr & Schmidt-inspired model:\n\nU_accept = split_self - \u03b1 * max(split_opp - split_self, 0) - \u03b2 * max(split_self - split_opp, 0)\n\nBut this uses two parameters. However, the problem allows up to two. But in the previous models, the parameters were alpha (sensitivity to money) and beta (sensitivity to fairness). Here, alpha and beta are sensitivities to disadvantageous and advantageous inequality. \n\nBut given that the responder's role is to accept or reject, and if they reject, both get zero. So, when the offer is split_self, the proposer gets split_opp. If the responder accepts, they get split_self, proposer gets split_opp. If they reject, both get zero. So, the responder's utility of accepting is based on their own payoff and the inequality. \n\nBut in the dataset, when the participant is the responder, trial_role is 1. So, the model should only consider those trials. \n\nHowever, the Fehr & Schmidt model has two parameters. But maybe in this context, advantageous inequality (split_self > split_opp) is less impactful, so \u03b2 could be set to zero, reducing to one parameter. But the previous models already have two parameters, so introducing a two-parameter model here is acceptable. \n\nBut the problem says the model should have no more than two learnable parameters. So, this model would fit. However, the question is whether this model is different from the previous ones and whether it can be implemented with the given variables. \n\nIn the dataset, split_opp and split_self are available. So, the model can be implemented. \n\nBut another angle: the model could combine both the absolute monetary gain (split_self) and the difference between the proposed split and the equitable split based on contributions. For example, the equitable split for the responder is 3*token_self, and the proposer's equitable is 3*token_opp. The proposed split_self should be compared to 3*token_self, and the split_opp to 3*token_opp. The difference between these could be another term. \n\nSo, the utility could be:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * [(split_self - 3*token_self) - (split_opp - 3*token_opp)]\n\nThis term inside the brackets represents the difference between the responder's excess and the proposer's excess. If both are getting their fair share, the term is zero. If the responder is getting more than their share and the proposer less, the term is positive. If the responder is getting less and the proposer more, it's negative. \n\nBut split_opp is equal to combined_earning - split_self, which is 3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self. So, split_opp - 3*token_opp = 3*token_self - split_self. \n\nSo, substituting:\n\n(split_self - 3*token_self) - (split_opp - 3*token_opp) = (split_self - 3*token_self) - (3*token_self - split_self) = 2*(split_self - 3*token_self)\n\nSo, the term simplifies to 2*(split_self - 3*token_self). Then the utility becomes:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * 2*(split_self - 3*token_self)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nU_accept = (\u03b1 + 2\u03b2) * split_self - 6\u03b2 * token_self\n\nBut this is a linear combination of split_self and token_self. However, this would mean that the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 are not identifiable because they combine into coefficients for split_self and token_self. This would lead to high covariance between parameters, which the problem wants to avoid. So, this approach might not be good for parameter recovery. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the Fehr & Schmidt model is better, as it directly uses the difference between split_self and split_opp. \n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the ratio of the proposed shares to the contributions. For example, the responder's share over their contribution (split_self / (3*token_self)) and the proposer's share over theirs (split_opp / (3*token_opp)). The utility could be a function of these ratios. \n\nBut if token_self is zero, this would cause division by zero. However, in the pretask, participants find tokens, so token_self is at least some positive number. The dataset's token_self is an int64, so presumably non-negative. But need to check if token_self can be zero. The problem statement mentions that in the pretask, participants find a number of tokens, so it's possible that token_self could be zero, but maybe in practice, it's always positive. \n\nAssuming token_self and token_opp are positive, the model could use the ratio. For example:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * ( (split_self / (3*token_self)) - (split_opp / (3*token_opp)) )\n\nThis term represents the difference in the ratios of received amount to contribution between the responder and proposer. If the responder's ratio is higher, it's positive; if lower, negative. \n\nBut this introduces two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2. However, this model might capture both the absolute monetary gain and the relative fairness compared to contributions. \n\nBut this model would have parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2. However, the term (split_self/(3*token_self) - split_opp/(3*token_opp)) could be rewritten as (split_self / 3*token_self) - ( (combined_earning - split_self) / (3*token_opp) )\n\nBut this might complicate things. However, the variables are available in the dataset, so it's feasible. \n\nBut considering parameter recovery, if \u03b1 and \u03b2 are both scaling different terms, they might be less correlated. For example, \u03b1 scales the absolute monetary term, and \u03b2 scales the relative fairness term. \n\nComparing to previous models, this model introduces a new fairness term based on the ratio of shares to contributions, which hasn't been done before. \n\nAlternatively, the model could use the difference between the proposed percentage (splitperc_self) and the equitable percentage (token_self / (token_self + token_opp) * 100). This is similar to Model 1 but using splitperc_self instead of split_self. However, splitperc_self is already a percentage, so the term would be splitperc_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp) * 100). This is exactly what Model 1 does. So, that's already covered. \n\nAnother angle: the model could consider the difference between the proposed split and the equitable split in monetary terms. The equitable split for the responder is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. The difference between split_self and this value could be the fairness term. \n\nSo, the equitable split is:\n\nequitable_self = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nThen, the fairness term is split_self - equitable_self. \n\nBut combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so:\n\nequitable_self = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 3*(token_self + token_opp) ) = 3*token_self\n\nSo, split_self - equitable_self is split_self - 3*token_self, which is the same as Model 2's fairness term. So, this approach is already covered in Model 2. \n\nTherefore, to propose a new model, we need to think of a different psychological mechanism not yet covered. \n\nAnother possibility is intention-based reciprocity. The responder might consider how kind the proposer's offer is relative to what they could have offered. For example, if the proposer had the option to offer more but chose to offer less, the responder might perceive this as unkind and derive lower utility. However, modeling intention requires knowing the alternatives available to the proposer, which might not be present in the dataset. The dataset includes trial_type (1=equal, 2=opponent more, 3=participant more), which might indicate the proposer's possible choices. But without knowing the full set of possible offers, it's hard to model intention. \n\nAlternatively, the model could use the trial_type to modulate the fairness evaluation. For example, in trials where the participant contributed more (trial_type=3), the responder might expect a higher share, and deviations from that would be more penalized. But trial_type is categorical, and incorporating it would require additional parameters or interactions, which might complicate the model beyond two parameters. \n\nGiven the constraints, perhaps the best approach is to consider a model that combines absolute monetary gain with a term that captures the proposer's excess relative to their contribution. For example:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (split_opp - 3*token_opp)\n\nBut split_opp is the proposer's share, and 3*token_opp is their contribution. So, (split_opp - 3*token_opp) is how much the proposer is gaining beyond their contribution. If the proposer is keeping more than their contribution, this term is positive, which might be seen as unfair, reducing the utility. So, \u03b2 would be negative, penalizing the proposer's excess. \n\nBut split_opp = combined_earning - split_self = 3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self. So, split_opp - 3*token_opp = 3*token_self - split_self. \n\nSo, substituting:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (3*token_self - split_self)\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\nU_accept = (\u03b1 - \u03b2) * split_self + 3\u03b2 * token_self\n\nBut this is a linear combination of split_self and token_self. However, this introduces two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2, but they are combined in a way that might lead to high covariance. For example, if \u03b1 and \u03b2 are highly correlated, the parameters might not be recoverable. \n\nAlternatively, the model could be:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (3*token_self - split_opp)\n\nBut split_opp is 3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self. So, 3*token_self - split_opp = 3*token_self - [3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self] = 3*token_self -3*token_self -3*token_opp + split_self = split_self -3*token_opp. \n\nSo, the term becomes split_self -3*token_opp. But I'm not sure what this represents. Maybe the difference between the responder's share and the proposer's contribution. Not sure if that's meaningful. \n\nAlternatively, the model could consider both the responder's and proposer's excess over their contributions:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * [(split_self - 3*token_self) + (split_opp - 3*token_opp)]\n\nBut split_self + split_opp = 3*(token_self + token_opp), so (split_self -3*token_self) + (split_opp -3*token_opp) = 3*(token_self + token_opp) -3*(token_self + token_opp) = 0. So, this term is always zero. Therefore, this approach is invalid. \n\nHmm. So, perhaps the only way to model the proposer's excess is through the term (split_opp -3*token_opp) = 3*token_self - split_self. \n\nSo, the utility function becomes:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (3*token_self - split_self)\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nU_accept = (\u03b1 - \u03b2) * split_self + 3\u03b2 * token_self\n\nThis model combines the absolute monetary gain (split_self) with the proposer's excess (3*token_self - split_self). If \u03b2 is negative, then higher proposer excess reduces utility. \n\nBut this model has two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2. However, the terms are linear combinations, which might lead to identifiability issues. For example, if \u03b1 and \u03b2 are such that (\u03b1 - \u03b2) and 3\u03b2 are the coefficients, there could be multiple (\u03b1, \u03b2) pairs that produce the same utility. This would make parameter recovery difficult. \n\nTo avoid this, perhaps the model should use non-linear terms or different variables. But given the constraints of two parameters, it's challenging. \n\nAlternatively, use a ratio. For example, the ratio of the responder's share to their contribution and the proposer's share to theirs. \n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * ( (split_self / (3*token_self)) / (split_opp / (3*token_opp)) )\n\nThis ratio represents how fair the split is relative to contributions. If the ratio is 1, it's perfectly fair. If it's less than 1, the responder is getting less than their contribution-relative share. \n\nBut this introduces a division, which could cause issues if any denominator is zero. Also, the ratio could be log-transformed to make it symmetric. \n\nAlternatively, use the log of the ratio:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * log( (split_self / (3*token_self)) / (split_opp / (3*token_opp)) )\n\nBut this requires that all terms are positive, which they are since split_self and split_opp are positive (as they are shares of the combined earnings). \n\nThis model captures the relative fairness in terms of the ratio of shares to contributions. If the ratio is greater than 1, the responder is getting a better deal than the proposer relative to their contributions, which might increase utility. If it's less than 1, it decreases utility. \n\nBut this model uses two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2, and the variables split_self, token_self, split_opp, and token_opp. However, split_opp can be expressed as combined_earning - split_self, which is 3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self. So, the ratio becomes:\n\n( (split_self / (3*token_self)) ) / ( (3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self) / (3*token_opp) )\n\nSimplifying:\n\n= [ split_self / (3 token_self) ] * [ 3 token_opp / (3 (token_self + token_opp) - split_self) ]\n\n= [ split_self * token_opp ] / [ token_self (3 (token_self + token_opp) - split_self) ]\n\nThis is a complex term, but it's manageable. However, the utility function now includes this ratio, which might capture the fairness perception in a different way than previous models. \n\nBut introducing a log ratio might make the model non-linear, which could complicate parameter estimation but might also capture more nuanced behavior. However, with only two parameters, this could be feasible. \n\nBut considering parameter recovery, if \u03b1 and \u03b2 are orthogonal in their effects, this model might have better identifiability. For example, \u03b1 affects the absolute monetary term, and \u03b2 affects the fairness ratio. \n\nComparing to previous models, this would be a new approach, focusing on the ratio of shares to contributions rather than absolute differences. \n\nHowever, the problem states that the model should be applicable using the provided dataset variables. Since split_opp is available, but also can be calculated from combined_earning and split_self, it's feasible. \n\nBut the model needs to use variables that are present. The variables available include token_self, token_opp, split_self, split_opp, etc. So, this model is feasible. \n\nBut the question is whether this model would be better in terms of BIC and parameter recovery compared to previous ones. Since the previous models have varying BIC scores, introducing a model that captures a different aspect of fairness could provide a better fit. \n\nAlternatively, another approach is to model the utility as a function of the difference between the proposed split and the equitable split, scaled by the total combined earnings. For example:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (split_self - 3*token_self) / combined_earning\n\nThis term represents the deviation from the equitable split as a proportion of the total earnings. This could capture the idea that the same absolute difference is more significant when the total is smaller. \n\nBut combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so the term becomes (split_self -3*token_self)/(3*(token_self + token_opp)). This is similar to Model 3, which uses (split_self -3*token_self)/(3*token_self), but here it's normalized by the total. \n\nThis model uses two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2. The first term is absolute gain, the second is proportional fairness relative to total. \n\nBut this is similar to Model 3 but scaled differently. \n\nGiven that the previous models have explored absolute and proportional fairness based on the participant's contribution, a model that incorporates the proposer's share relative to their contribution could be a new direction. \n\nSo, going back to the Fehr & Schmidt-inspired model:\n\nU_accept = split_self - \u03b1 * max(split_opp - split_self, 0) - \u03b2 * max(split_self - split_opp, 0)\n\nThis model has two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2. However, in the context of responder behavior, advantageous inequality (split_self > split_opp) might not be as relevant, as responders are more focused on disadvantageous inequality. But the model allows for both. \n\nHowever, given the constraint of two parameters, this model is feasible. But how does it compare to previous models? \n\nModel 2 uses split_self and split_self -3*token_self. The Fehr & Schmidt model uses split_self and the difference between split_opp and split_self. These are different fairness considerations. \n\nIn terms of psychological principles, Model 2 is based on equity theory (matching contributions), while the Fehr & Schmidt model is based on inequity aversion (comparing payoffs). These are different mechanisms, so this would be a new model. \n\nGiven that the previous models have not considered the proposer's payoff directly, this model offers a different explanation. \n\nBut in the dataset, when the participant is the responder, the proposer's split_opp is known. So, this model can be implemented. \n\nTherefore, the Fehr & Schmidt-inspired model with two parameters (\u03b1 and \u03b2) could be a good candidate. \n\nBut the problem requires that the model should have no more than two learnable parameters. This model does. \n\nHowever, in practice, for responder decisions, advantageous inequality (split_self > split_opp) might not be a concern, so \u03b2 could be negligible. But without data, it's hard to say. Including both parameters allows the model to test both effects. \n\nBut given the parameter recovery concerns, having two parameters that are not highly correlated is better. In the Fehr & Schmidt model, \u03b1 and \u03b2 represent aversion to disadvantageous and advantageous inequality, which are conceptually distinct, so they might not be highly correlated, aiding parameter recovery. \n\nTherefore, this model is a viable new approach not covered by the previous models. \n\nSo, the model would be:\n\nU_accept = split_self - \u03b1 * max(split_opp - split_self, 0) - \u03b2 * max(split_self - split_opp, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b1 is the aversion to disadvantageous inequality (when split_opp > split_self), and \u03b2 is aversion to advantageous inequality (when split_self > split_opp). \n\nBut in the context of responder behavior, rejecting an offer leads to zero for both. So, if the offer is disadvantageous (split_opp > split_self), the responder might reject to punish the proposer, even at a cost to themselves. The utility of accepting would be lower if \u03b1 is positive. \n\nHowever, the problem states that the model should not include the utility of rejecting, only the utility of accepting. So, this model focuses on the utility of accepting, which decreases if there's disadvantageous inequality. \n\nBut in Fehr & Schmidt's model, the utility of accepting is as above. If this utility is low enough, the responder would reject. \n\nThis model uses two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2, which are learnable. The variables split_self and split_opp are from the data. \n\nNow, checking the dataset variables: split_opp and split_self are available. So, this model is feasible. \n\nThe parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 should have bounds. Since they represent aversion coefficients, they are typically positive. For example, \u03b1 could be in [0, 5], and \u03b2 in [0, 5], assuming that higher values indicate stronger aversion. \n\nBut the problem says the bounds should be generous. So, perhaps \u03b1 and \u03b2 are in [0, 10], inclusive. \n\nThus, the model would be:\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = split_self - alpha * max(split_opp - split_self, 0) - beta * max(split_self - split_opp, 0)\n</MODEL>\n\nVariables:\n- split_self: from data\n- split_opp: from data\n- alpha: learnable parameter, aversion to disadvantageous inequality\n- beta: learnable parameter, aversion to advantageous inequality\n\nThis model captures two psychological principles: aversion to disadvantageous and advantageous inequality. It uses two parameters, which are learnable within bounds. \n\nNow, checking against the requirements:\n\n1. Predict responder behavior: Yes, as it's based on responder's utility of accepting.\n2. Builds on psychological principles: Yes, inequity aversion.\n3. Considers high covariance: Parameters alpha and beta are for different terms, so covariance might be lower.\n4.

The model captures how responders evaluate offers relative to the proposer's share, penalizing unequal outcomes even when beneficial.",
  "full_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts the utility of accepting an offer for the responder in the given experiment. The model needs to be based on psychological principles, have no more than two learnable parameters, and avoid high covariance between parameters for good parameter recovery.\n\nFirst, looking at the previous models, they all combine absolute monetary gain (split_self) with some form of fairness consideration. Model 1 uses proportional fairness based on token contributions, Model 2 uses a direct comparison to the participant's contribution (3*token_self), and Model 3 uses a proportional deviation from that contribution. The BIC scores suggest that Model 2 performs better, possibly because it's simpler and has better parameter recovery.\n\nNow, considering psychological principles, fairness and self-interest are key. People might compare the offer to what they contributed (equity theory) and also consider the relative split compared to the opponent. Another angle is the concept of inequity aversion, where people dislike unequal outcomes. However, the previous models already cover contribution-based fairness. Maybe there's another aspect, like the difference between what the responder gets and what the proposer keeps. For example, if the proposer is keeping a lot more, that might feel unfair even if the responder's share is above their contribution.\n\nWait, the dataset includes split_opp (the opponent's proposed share) and split_self. When the participant is the responder, the proposer is the opponent. So, the split_opp is what the proposer is keeping, and split_self is what they're offering. The combined_earning is split_opp + split_self. So, the responder's utility might depend not just on their own share but also on how much the proposer is keeping relative to their own contribution.\n\nAnother variable is trial_type, which indicates whether contributions are equal, opponent more, or participant more. This might influence fairness perceptions. For example, if the opponent contributed more, maybe the responder expects a lower share. But trial_type is categorical, so integrating it into a continuous utility model might be tricky. Maybe instead, the model should consider the difference in contributions (token_self vs. token_opp) and how the split compares to that.\n\nThe token_self and token_opp variables represent each party's contribution. Each token is worth \u00a33, so the participant's contribution is 3*token_self, and the opponent's is 3*token_opp. The total combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). The equitable split would be proportional to contributions. So, the fair share for the participant would be (3*token_self / combined_earning)*100%, but the splitperc_self is given as a percentage. \n\nBut previous models have used the difference between the actual split and the equitable split. Maybe another approach is to consider the difference between the proposed split and the equitable split in absolute terms (like Model 2) or relative terms (like Model 3). However, the previous models have already explored these. To come up with a new model, perhaps we need to look at the ratio between the proposed split and the equitable split. For example, if the proposed split is less than the equitable split, the utility decreases.\n\nAlternatively, the model could incorporate the proposer's share relative to their contribution. For instance, if the proposer is keeping a share that's more than their contribution, that might be seen as unfair. So, the responder's utility could depend on both their own share compared to their contribution and the proposer's share compared to theirs.\n\nLet me formalize this. Suppose the equitable split for the participant is 3*token_self, and for the proposer is 3*token_opp. The proposed split for the participant is split_self, and the proposer keeps split_opp. The fair split would be split_self = 3*token_self and split_opp = 3*token_opp. But in reality, split_self + split_opp = combined_earning = 3*(token_self + token_opp). So, any deviation from the equitable split would mean one party is getting more than their contribution.\n\nThe utility could then be a function of how much the participant's share exceeds their contribution and how much the proposer's share exceeds theirs. For example, if the participant's share is split_self - 3*token_self (their gain over contribution) and the proposer's is split_opp - 3*token_opp. Inequity aversion would suggest that the responder dislikes when the proposer gets more than their fair share, even if the responder's share is fair. \n\nBut since split_opp = combined_earning - split_self, we can express everything in terms of split_self. Let's see:\n\nsplit_opp = 3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self.\n\nThe proposer's excess is split_opp - 3*token_opp = [3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self] - 3*token_opp = 3*token_self - split_self.\n\nWait, that's interesting. The proposer's excess is 3*token_self - split_self. So, if split_self is less than 3*token_self, the proposer is keeping more than their contribution. So, the proposer's excess is (split_opp - 3*token_opp) = (combined_earning - split_self) - 3*token_opp = 3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self - 3*token_opp = 3*token_self - split_self. \n\nSo, the proposer's excess is 3*token_self - split_self. If split_self is less than 3*token_self, the proposer is getting more than their contribution. The responder's excess is split_self - 3*token_self. \n\nSo, the utility could be a combination of the responder's own gain (split_self - 3*token_self) and the proposer's gain (3*token_self - split_self). But since these are opposites (if one is positive, the other is negative), maybe the model should consider both terms. For example, the responder might dislike when the proposer gains more than their contribution, even if the responder's share is fair. \n\nThis is similar to inequity aversion models where people dislike inequality, whether it's advantageous or disadvantageous. But in this case, since the responder can only accept or reject, maybe they are more sensitive to disadvantageous inequality. \n\nSo, the utility could be:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * max(0, (3*token_self - split_self) - (split_self - 3*token_self)) )\n\nWait, that might not be right. Alternatively, the responder's utility could decrease if the proposer's excess is positive. So, the utility could be:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self - \u03b2 * (3*token_self - split_self)\n\nBut 3*token_self - split_self is the proposer's excess. If split_self is less than 3*token_self, then the proposer is keeping more than their contribution, which might be seen as unfair. So, the responder's utility would decrease by \u03b2 multiplied by that excess. \n\nAlternatively, the model could be:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (split_self - (3*token_self - split_opp))\n\nWait, split_opp is the proposer's share. But split_opp = combined_earning - split_self. So, split_opp = 3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self. \n\nBut maybe the key is to compare the split_self to the equitable split (3*token_self) and also compare the split_opp to the proposer's equitable split (3*token_opp). The difference between split_self and 3*token_self is the responder's gain/loss, and split_opp - 3*token_opp is the proposer's gain/loss. Inequity aversion would suggest that the responder dislikes when the proposer's gain is higher than theirs. \n\nA standard inequity aversion model (like Fehr & Schmidt, 1999) has utility as:\n\nU = x - \u03b1 * max(y - x, 0) - \u03b2 * max(x - y, 0)\n\nwhere x is own payoff, y is other's payoff. But in this case, the responder's payoff is split_self if accepted, and possibly zero if rejected. But the model should only consider the utility of accepting. So, x = split_self, y = split_opp. \n\nBut according to Fehr & Schmidt, the utility would be:\n\nU_accept = split_self - \u03b1 * max(split_opp - split_self, 0) - \u03b2 * max(split_self - split_opp, 0)\n\nBut this model has two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2, which are the aversion to disadvantageous and advantageous inequality, respectively. However, the problem states that the model should have no more than two learnable parameters. Since the previous models used two parameters, maybe this is acceptable. However, the task says to not include parameters for general stochasticity, but here \u03b1 and \u03b2 are part of the utility function. \n\nBut the problem specifies that the model should predict only responder behavior and build on psychological principles. Inequity aversion is a well-established principle. However, in the previous models, the focus was on contribution-based fairness. Using an inequity aversion model that compares payoffs directly (split_self vs split_opp) could be a different approach not yet explored in the previous models. \n\nBut let's check the previous models. Model 1 uses splitperc_self vs equitable percentage. Model 2 uses split_self vs 3*token_self. Model 3 uses proportional deviation from 3*token_self. None of them directly compare the split_self and split_opp. So, this would be a new model. \n\nSo, the utility could be:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self - \u03b2 * (split_opp - split_self) if split_opp > split_self\n\nBut this is a piecewise function. Alternatively, using the Fehr & Schmidt model:\n\nU_accept = split_self - \u03b1 * max(split_opp - split_self, 0) - \u03b2 * max(split_self - split_opp, 0)\n\nBut this has two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2. However, the problem allows up to two parameters. But the task says the model should have no more than two learnable parameters. So, this is acceptable. However, in the context of responder behavior, when the responder is deciding to accept or reject, advantageous inequality (split_self > split_opp) might be less relevant, as responders are more concerned with being treated fairly (disadvantageous inequality). So, maybe \u03b2 can be set to zero, but that would reduce the model to one parameter. Alternatively, include both, but that uses two parameters. \n\nBut looking at the previous models, they all have two parameters. So, introducing a model with two parameters (\u03b1 and \u03b2) for inequity aversion would be a new direction. However, the problem states that the model should not include parameters for general stochasticity, but these are part of the utility function, so that's okay. \n\nBut wait, the task says the model should not include parameters to simulate general stochasticity because that will be handled later by a temperature parameter. So, the parameters here should be part of the utility calculation, not the noise. \n\nSo, proceeding with the Fehr & Schmidt-inspired model:\n\nU_accept = split_self - \u03b1 * max(split_opp - split_self, 0) - \u03b2 * max(split_self - split_opp, 0)\n\nBut this uses two parameters. However, the problem allows up to two. But in the previous models, the parameters were alpha (sensitivity to money) and beta (sensitivity to fairness). Here, alpha and beta are sensitivities to disadvantageous and advantageous inequality. \n\nBut given that the responder's role is to accept or reject, and if they reject, both get zero. So, when the offer is split_self, the proposer gets split_opp. If the responder accepts, they get split_self, proposer gets split_opp. If they reject, both get zero. So, the responder's utility of accepting is based on their own payoff and the inequality. \n\nBut in the dataset, when the participant is the responder, trial_role is 1. So, the model should only consider those trials. \n\nHowever, the Fehr & Schmidt model has two parameters. But maybe in this context, advantageous inequality (split_self > split_opp) is less impactful, so \u03b2 could be set to zero, reducing to one parameter. But the previous models already have two parameters, so introducing a two-parameter model here is acceptable. \n\nBut the problem says the model should have no more than two learnable parameters. So, this model would fit. However, the question is whether this model is different from the previous ones and whether it can be implemented with the given variables. \n\nIn the dataset, split_opp and split_self are available. So, the model can be implemented. \n\nBut another angle: the model could combine both the absolute monetary gain (split_self) and the difference between the proposed split and the equitable split based on contributions. For example, the equitable split for the responder is 3*token_self, and the proposer's equitable is 3*token_opp. The proposed split_self should be compared to 3*token_self, and the split_opp to 3*token_opp. The difference between these could be another term. \n\nSo, the utility could be:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * [(split_self - 3*token_self) - (split_opp - 3*token_opp)]\n\nThis term inside the brackets represents the difference between the responder's excess and the proposer's excess. If both are getting their fair share, the term is zero. If the responder is getting more than their share and the proposer less, the term is positive. If the responder is getting less and the proposer more, it's negative. \n\nBut split_opp is equal to combined_earning - split_self, which is 3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self. So, split_opp - 3*token_opp = 3*token_self - split_self. \n\nSo, substituting:\n\n(split_self - 3*token_self) - (split_opp - 3*token_opp) = (split_self - 3*token_self) - (3*token_self - split_self) = 2*(split_self - 3*token_self)\n\nSo, the term simplifies to 2*(split_self - 3*token_self). Then the utility becomes:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * 2*(split_self - 3*token_self)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nU_accept = (\u03b1 + 2\u03b2) * split_self - 6\u03b2 * token_self\n\nBut this is a linear combination of split_self and token_self. However, this would mean that the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 are not identifiable because they combine into coefficients for split_self and token_self. This would lead to high covariance between parameters, which the problem wants to avoid. So, this approach might not be good for parameter recovery. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the Fehr & Schmidt model is better, as it directly uses the difference between split_self and split_opp. \n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the ratio of the proposed shares to the contributions. For example, the responder's share over their contribution (split_self / (3*token_self)) and the proposer's share over theirs (split_opp / (3*token_opp)). The utility could be a function of these ratios. \n\nBut if token_self is zero, this would cause division by zero. However, in the pretask, participants find tokens, so token_self is at least some positive number. The dataset's token_self is an int64, so presumably non-negative. But need to check if token_self can be zero. The problem statement mentions that in the pretask, participants find a number of tokens, so it's possible that token_self could be zero, but maybe in practice, it's always positive. \n\nAssuming token_self and token_opp are positive, the model could use the ratio. For example:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * ( (split_self / (3*token_self)) - (split_opp / (3*token_opp)) )\n\nThis term represents the difference in the ratios of received amount to contribution between the responder and proposer. If the responder's ratio is higher, it's positive; if lower, negative. \n\nBut this introduces two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2. However, this model might capture both the absolute monetary gain and the relative fairness compared to contributions. \n\nBut this model would have parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2. However, the term (split_self/(3*token_self) - split_opp/(3*token_opp)) could be rewritten as (split_self / 3*token_self) - ( (combined_earning - split_self) / (3*token_opp) )\n\nBut this might complicate things. However, the variables are available in the dataset, so it's feasible. \n\nBut considering parameter recovery, if \u03b1 and \u03b2 are both scaling different terms, they might be less correlated. For example, \u03b1 scales the absolute monetary term, and \u03b2 scales the relative fairness term. \n\nComparing to previous models, this model introduces a new fairness term based on the ratio of shares to contributions, which hasn't been done before. \n\nAlternatively, the model could use the difference between the proposed percentage (splitperc_self) and the equitable percentage (token_self / (token_self + token_opp) * 100). This is similar to Model 1 but using splitperc_self instead of split_self. However, splitperc_self is already a percentage, so the term would be splitperc_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp) * 100). This is exactly what Model 1 does. So, that's already covered. \n\nAnother angle: the model could consider the difference between the proposed split and the equitable split in monetary terms. The equitable split for the responder is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. The difference between split_self and this value could be the fairness term. \n\nSo, the equitable split is:\n\nequitable_self = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nThen, the fairness term is split_self - equitable_self. \n\nBut combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so:\n\nequitable_self = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 3*(token_self + token_opp) ) = 3*token_self\n\nSo, split_self - equitable_self is split_self - 3*token_self, which is the same as Model 2's fairness term. So, this approach is already covered in Model 2. \n\nTherefore, to propose a new model, we need to think of a different psychological mechanism not yet covered. \n\nAnother possibility is intention-based reciprocity. The responder might consider how kind the proposer's offer is relative to what they could have offered. For example, if the proposer had the option to offer more but chose to offer less, the responder might perceive this as unkind and derive lower utility. However, modeling intention requires knowing the alternatives available to the proposer, which might not be present in the dataset. The dataset includes trial_type (1=equal, 2=opponent more, 3=participant more), which might indicate the proposer's possible choices. But without knowing the full set of possible offers, it's hard to model intention. \n\nAlternatively, the model could use the trial_type to modulate the fairness evaluation. For example, in trials where the participant contributed more (trial_type=3), the responder might expect a higher share, and deviations from that would be more penalized. But trial_type is categorical, and incorporating it would require additional parameters or interactions, which might complicate the model beyond two parameters. \n\nGiven the constraints, perhaps the best approach is to consider a model that combines absolute monetary gain with a term that captures the proposer's excess relative to their contribution. For example:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (split_opp - 3*token_opp)\n\nBut split_opp is the proposer's share, and 3*token_opp is their contribution. So, (split_opp - 3*token_opp) is how much the proposer is gaining beyond their contribution. If the proposer is keeping more than their contribution, this term is positive, which might be seen as unfair, reducing the utility. So, \u03b2 would be negative, penalizing the proposer's excess. \n\nBut split_opp = combined_earning - split_self = 3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self. So, split_opp - 3*token_opp = 3*token_self - split_self. \n\nSo, substituting:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (3*token_self - split_self)\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\nU_accept = (\u03b1 - \u03b2) * split_self + 3\u03b2 * token_self\n\nBut this is a linear combination of split_self and token_self. However, this introduces two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2, but they are combined in a way that might lead to high covariance. For example, if \u03b1 and \u03b2 are highly correlated, the parameters might not be recoverable. \n\nAlternatively, the model could be:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (3*token_self - split_opp)\n\nBut split_opp is 3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self. So, 3*token_self - split_opp = 3*token_self - [3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self] = 3*token_self -3*token_self -3*token_opp + split_self = split_self -3*token_opp. \n\nSo, the term becomes split_self -3*token_opp. But I'm not sure what this represents. Maybe the difference between the responder's share and the proposer's contribution. Not sure if that's meaningful. \n\nAlternatively, the model could consider both the responder's and proposer's excess over their contributions:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * [(split_self - 3*token_self) + (split_opp - 3*token_opp)]\n\nBut split_self + split_opp = 3*(token_self + token_opp), so (split_self -3*token_self) + (split_opp -3*token_opp) = 3*(token_self + token_opp) -3*(token_self + token_opp) = 0. So, this term is always zero. Therefore, this approach is invalid. \n\nHmm. So, perhaps the only way to model the proposer's excess is through the term (split_opp -3*token_opp) = 3*token_self - split_self. \n\nSo, the utility function becomes:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (3*token_self - split_self)\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nU_accept = (\u03b1 - \u03b2) * split_self + 3\u03b2 * token_self\n\nThis model combines the absolute monetary gain (split_self) with the proposer's excess (3*token_self - split_self). If \u03b2 is negative, then higher proposer excess reduces utility. \n\nBut this model has two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2. However, the terms are linear combinations, which might lead to identifiability issues. For example, if \u03b1 and \u03b2 are such that (\u03b1 - \u03b2) and 3\u03b2 are the coefficients, there could be multiple (\u03b1, \u03b2) pairs that produce the same utility. This would make parameter recovery difficult. \n\nTo avoid this, perhaps the model should use non-linear terms or different variables. But given the constraints of two parameters, it's challenging. \n\nAlternatively, use a ratio. For example, the ratio of the responder's share to their contribution and the proposer's share to theirs. \n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * ( (split_self / (3*token_self)) / (split_opp / (3*token_opp)) )\n\nThis ratio represents how fair the split is relative to contributions. If the ratio is 1, it's perfectly fair. If it's less than 1, the responder is getting less than their contribution-relative share. \n\nBut this introduces a division, which could cause issues if any denominator is zero. Also, the ratio could be log-transformed to make it symmetric. \n\nAlternatively, use the log of the ratio:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * log( (split_self / (3*token_self)) / (split_opp / (3*token_opp)) )\n\nBut this requires that all terms are positive, which they are since split_self and split_opp are positive (as they are shares of the combined earnings). \n\nThis model captures the relative fairness in terms of the ratio of shares to contributions. If the ratio is greater than 1, the responder is getting a better deal than the proposer relative to their contributions, which might increase utility. If it's less than 1, it decreases utility. \n\nBut this model uses two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2, and the variables split_self, token_self, split_opp, and token_opp. However, split_opp can be expressed as combined_earning - split_self, which is 3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self. So, the ratio becomes:\n\n( (split_self / (3*token_self)) ) / ( (3*(token_self + token_opp) - split_self) / (3*token_opp) )\n\nSimplifying:\n\n= [ split_self / (3 token_self) ] * [ 3 token_opp / (3 (token_self + token_opp) - split_self) ]\n\n= [ split_self * token_opp ] / [ token_self (3 (token_self + token_opp) - split_self) ]\n\nThis is a complex term, but it's manageable. However, the utility function now includes this ratio, which might capture the fairness perception in a different way than previous models. \n\nBut introducing a log ratio might make the model non-linear, which could complicate parameter estimation but might also capture more nuanced behavior. However, with only two parameters, this could be feasible. \n\nBut considering parameter recovery, if \u03b1 and \u03b2 are orthogonal in their effects, this model might have better identifiability. For example, \u03b1 affects the absolute monetary term, and \u03b2 affects the fairness ratio. \n\nComparing to previous models, this would be a new approach, focusing on the ratio of shares to contributions rather than absolute differences. \n\nHowever, the problem states that the model should be applicable using the provided dataset variables. Since split_opp is available, but also can be calculated from combined_earning and split_self, it's feasible. \n\nBut the model needs to use variables that are present. The variables available include token_self, token_opp, split_self, split_opp, etc. So, this model is feasible. \n\nBut the question is whether this model would be better in terms of BIC and parameter recovery compared to previous ones. Since the previous models have varying BIC scores, introducing a model that captures a different aspect of fairness could provide a better fit. \n\nAlternatively, another approach is to model the utility as a function of the difference between the proposed split and the equitable split, scaled by the total combined earnings. For example:\n\nU_accept = \u03b1 * split_self + \u03b2 * (split_self - 3*token_self) / combined_earning\n\nThis term represents the deviation from the equitable split as a proportion of the total earnings. This could capture the idea that the same absolute difference is more significant when the total is smaller. \n\nBut combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so the term becomes (split_self -3*token_self)/(3*(token_self + token_opp)). This is similar to Model 3, which uses (split_self -3*token_self)/(3*token_self), but here it's normalized by the total. \n\nThis model uses two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2. The first term is absolute gain, the second is proportional fairness relative to total. \n\nBut this is similar to Model 3 but scaled differently. \n\nGiven that the previous models have explored absolute and proportional fairness based on the participant's contribution, a model that incorporates the proposer's share relative to their contribution could be a new direction. \n\nSo, going back to the Fehr & Schmidt-inspired model:\n\nU_accept = split_self - \u03b1 * max(split_opp - split_self, 0) - \u03b2 * max(split_self - split_opp, 0)\n\nThis model has two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2. However, in the context of responder behavior, advantageous inequality (split_self > split_opp) might not be as relevant, as responders are more focused on disadvantageous inequality. But the model allows for both. \n\nHowever, given the constraint of two parameters, this model is feasible. But how does it compare to previous models? \n\nModel 2 uses split_self and split_self -3*token_self. The Fehr & Schmidt model uses split_self and the difference between split_opp and split_self. These are different fairness considerations. \n\nIn terms of psychological principles, Model 2 is based on equity theory (matching contributions), while the Fehr & Schmidt model is based on inequity aversion (comparing payoffs). These are different mechanisms, so this would be a new model. \n\nGiven that the previous models have not considered the proposer's payoff directly, this model offers a different explanation. \n\nBut in the dataset, when the participant is the responder, the proposer's split_opp is known. So, this model can be implemented. \n\nTherefore, the Fehr & Schmidt-inspired model with two parameters (\u03b1 and \u03b2) could be a good candidate. \n\nBut the problem requires that the model should have no more than two learnable parameters. This model does. \n\nHowever, in practice, for responder decisions, advantageous inequality (split_self > split_opp) might not be a concern, so \u03b2 could be negligible. But without data, it's hard to say. Including both parameters allows the model to test both effects. \n\nBut given the parameter recovery concerns, having two parameters that are not highly correlated is better. In the Fehr & Schmidt model, \u03b1 and \u03b2 represent aversion to disadvantageous and advantageous inequality, which are conceptually distinct, so they might not be highly correlated, aiding parameter recovery. \n\nTherefore, this model is a viable new approach not covered by the previous models. \n\nSo, the model would be:\n\nU_accept = split_self - \u03b1 * max(split_opp - split_self, 0) - \u03b2 * max(split_self - split_opp, 0)\n\nHere, \u03b1 is the aversion to disadvantageous inequality (when split_opp > split_self), and \u03b2 is aversion to advantageous inequality (when split_self > split_opp). \n\nBut in the context of responder behavior, rejecting an offer leads to zero for both. So, if the offer is disadvantageous (split_opp > split_self), the responder might reject to punish the proposer, even at a cost to themselves. The utility of accepting would be lower if \u03b1 is positive. \n\nHowever, the problem states that the model should not include the utility of rejecting, only the utility of accepting. So, this model focuses on the utility of accepting, which decreases if there's disadvantageous inequality. \n\nBut in Fehr & Schmidt's model, the utility of accepting is as above. If this utility is low enough, the responder would reject. \n\nThis model uses two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2, which are learnable. The variables split_self and split_opp are from the data. \n\nNow, checking the dataset variables: split_opp and split_self are available. So, this model is feasible. \n\nThe parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 should have bounds. Since they represent aversion coefficients, they are typically positive. For example, \u03b1 could be in [0, 5], and \u03b2 in [0, 5], assuming that higher values indicate stronger aversion. \n\nBut the problem says the bounds should be generous. So, perhaps \u03b1 and \u03b2 are in [0, 10], inclusive. \n\nThus, the model would be:\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = split_self - alpha * max(split_opp - split_self, 0) - beta * max(split_self - split_opp, 0)\n</MODEL>\n\nVariables:\n- split_self: from data\n- split_opp: from data\n- alpha: learnable parameter, aversion to disadvantageous inequality\n- beta: learnable parameter, aversion to advantageous inequality\n\nThis model captures two psychological principles: aversion to disadvantageous and advantageous inequality. It uses two parameters, which are learnable within bounds. \n\nNow, checking against the requirements:\n\n1. Predict responder behavior: Yes, as it's based on responder's utility of accepting.\n2. Builds on psychological principles: Yes, inequity aversion.\n3. Considers high covariance: Parameters alpha and beta are for different terms, so covariance might be lower.\n4. Uses dataset variables: split_self and split_opp are available.\n5. No stochasticity parameters: Correct.\n6. Two learnable parameters: Yes.\n7. Utility can be negative: Yes.\n\nThis model meets all the requirements. \n\nNow, comparing to previous models, this is a new approach not yet explored. The previous models focused on contribution-based fairness, while this one focuses on outcome-based fairness (inequity aversion). \n\nTherefore, this model would be a good addition to explore a different psychological mechanism.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = split_self - alpha * max(split_opp - split_self, 0) - beta * max(split_self - split_opp, 0)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer, combining monetary gain and inequity aversion\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed monetary amount for the participant (responder)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed monetary amount kept by the opponent (proposer)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Disadvantageous inequality aversion parameter (responder's aversion to receiving less than the proposer)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Advantageous inequality aversion parameter (responder's aversion to receiving more than the proposer)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model based on inequity aversion, where the utility of accepting an offer depends on the absolute monetary gain (split_self) and aversion to both disadvantageous (split_opp > split_self) and advantageous (split_self > split_opp) inequality.
