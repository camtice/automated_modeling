      "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts the utility of accepting an offer for the responder in the given experiment. The model needs to be based on psychological principles, use the dataset variables appropriately, and have no more than two learnable parameters. Also, it should avoid parameters for stochasticity since that's handled later by a temperature parameter.\n\nFirst, let's review the previous models to see what's been done already. \n\nModel 1 used split_self and a fairness term based on the deviation from the contribution-based percentage. Model 2 considered split_self and deviation from the participant's contribution (3*token_self). Model 3 added a proportional term to Model 2. Model 4 focused on inequity aversion between split_self and split_opp. Model 5 scaled the fairness term by the participant's contribution proportion.\n\nLooking at these, Models 2 and 3 are contribution-based, Model 4 is inequity aversion, and Model 5 combines contribution and proportion. The BIC scores suggest that Model 2 and Model 4 have better performance, but Model 4's parameter recovery for beta was poor. \n\nNow, considering psychological principles, fairness and self-interest are key. The responder's utility likely depends on both the absolute amount they receive (split_self) and how fair that amount is relative to some standard. Previous models have used equity (based on contributions) or equality (equal split) as fairness references. \n\nIn the dataset, each trial's combined_earning is variable, so equal splits (split_self = split_opp) might not be the same as equity-based splits (based on tokens contributed). The token_self and token_opp variables represent contributions, so equity would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. But combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so split_self should be compared to 3*token_self if contributions are the basis for equity. \n\nWait, combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so each token is worth \u00a33. So the participant's contribution is 3*token_self, and the opponent's is 3*token_opp. The total is combined_earning. So equity would suggest that each should get their contribution. But in the task, the split is proposed, so the responder evaluates if split_self is fair compared to their contribution. \n\nAlternatively, fairness could be based on the proportion of the total contributions. For example, if the participant contributed 60% of the tokens, they might expect 60% of the combined earnings. But combined_earning is 3*(sum of tokens), so 60% of that would be 3*(sum)*0.6. But split_self is the amount offered. So the fair share based on contribution would be (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. But since combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), this simplifies to 3*token_self. So split_self should equal 3*token_self for equity. \n\nSo Models 2 and 3 use 3*token_self as the equity reference. Model 2 uses the difference (split_self - 3*token_self), while Model 3 uses the proportional difference. \n\nAnother angle is the difference between the proposed split and the equal split. For example, if combined_earning is 30, an equal split would be 15 each. But if the participant contributed more tokens, maybe they expect more than half. However, trial_type indicates whether contributions were equal, opponent more, or participant more. But trial_type is a categorical variable. Maybe participants have different fairness standards based on trial_type. But the model needs to use variables in the dataset, and trial_type is available. However, using trial_type might complicate the model with more parameters. Since the model is limited to two parameters, perhaps trial_type isn't directly used but the fairness is calculated based on tokens. \n\nAnother psychological principle is loss aversion. If the proposed split_self is less than the equity value (3*token_self), the participant might perceive it as a loss, leading to a stronger negative reaction. So the disutility from unfairness could be nonlinear, but the model needs to be linear in parameters. Alternatively, the model could have a term that is the difference between split_self and equity, but only when split_self is less than equity. \n\nWait, Model 4 uses max functions for inequity aversion. But in Model 4, the parameters alpha and beta are for disadvantageous and advantageous inequality. However, in the responder's case, when they are deciding to accept or reject, they might only care about disadvantageous inequality (if they get less than the proposer). But Model 4's beta parameter (for advantageous inequality) had poor recovery, suggesting it's not as relevant. \n\nSo maybe focusing on disadvantageous inequality relative to equity. For example, the utility could be split_self minus a penalty when split_self is less than the equity value (3*token_self). The penalty could be scaled by a parameter. \n\nAlternatively, the model could combine the absolute monetary gain (split_self) with a term that represents the deviation from equity, but only when the offer is below equity. This would capture the idea that participants are sensitive to being shortchanged relative to their contribution. \n\nSo the utility could be:\n\nU_accept = alpha * split_self + beta * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, alpha is the sensitivity to monetary gain, and beta (negative) would represent the aversion to offers below their contribution. If the offer is below equity, the max term becomes positive, and multiplied by beta (which should be negative) reduces the utility. If beta is positive, that would imply they like being below equity, which doesn't make sense, so beta should be constrained to be negative. \n\nBut the problem states that the model should have parameters with finite bounds. So beta's range could be from, say, -10 to 0. \n\nAnother consideration is whether to normalize the equity term. For example, if the equity difference is (3*token_self - split_self), this could be a large value depending on the tokens. Maybe scaling it by something, but the model needs to be simple. \n\nLooking at previous models, Model 2 uses (split_self - 3*token_self), which is the same as -(3*token_self - split_self). So if beta is negative in Model 2, then a lower split_self would decrease utility. But in Model 2, the term is (split_self - 3*token_self), so if split_self is less than 3*token_self, this term is negative, and multiplied by beta (which in Model 2's case, if beta is negative, the product becomes positive, which would increase utility? Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me check Model 2 again.\n\nModel 2's specification is U_accept = alpha * split_self + beta * (split_self - 3 * token_self). So if split_self is less than 3*token_self, the term (split_self - 3*token_self) is negative. If beta is a learnable parameter, say negative, then beta*(negative term) becomes positive, which would increase utility. That doesn't make sense because getting less than equity should decrease utility. So perhaps in Model 2, beta is expected to be positive. But if beta is positive, then when split_self is less than equity, the term is negative, leading to lower utility. Wait, no: if beta is positive, then beta*(split_self - equity) would be negative when split_self < equity, thus reducing utility. That makes sense. So in Model 2, beta is a positive parameter, and higher beta means more penalty for being below equity. \n\nBut in the current task, the user wants to design a model that hasn't been tried yet. Since Model 2 already uses the linear term (split_self - 3*token_self), perhaps a different approach is needed. \n\nAnother angle is to consider the ratio between split_self and the equity value. For example, split_self / (3*token_self). If this ratio is less than 1, the participant is getting less than their contribution. The utility could then be alpha * split_self + beta * (split_self / (3*token_self)). But this introduces a division, which might complicate parameter recovery. However, this would capture proportional fairness. \n\nAlternatively, using a reference-dependent model where the reference point is the equity value. The utility is split_self plus a term that depends on whether split_self is above or below the reference. For example, U = split_self + beta * (split_self >= 3*token_self ? 0 : (3*token_self - split_self)). But this is similar to the max function. \n\nWait, the max function approach: U_accept = alpha * split_self + beta * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0). Here, if the offer is below equity, the max term is positive, and beta (which would be negative) reduces the utility. If the offer is above equity, the max term is zero, so only split_self matters. This captures loss aversion relative to the equity reference. \n\nThis model would have two parameters: alpha (sensitivity to monetary gain) and beta (sensitivity to losses below equity). The parameters need to be bounded. For alpha, it's logical to have a positive value since higher split_self should increase utility. Beta should be negative because when the offer is below equity, the max term is positive, and multiplying by a negative beta would subtract from utility. \n\nThis model hasn't been tried in the previous models. Model 2 uses a linear term, which could be positive or negative. The max function would only penalize when below equity, which might better capture loss aversion. \n\nAnother consideration is the interaction between split_self and the equity term. For example, maybe the disutility is proportional to how much they are below equity. The max term captures that. \n\nSo the model would be:\n\nU_accept = alpha * split_self + beta * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, alpha is positive, beta is negative. \n\nThis model uses two parameters, which fits the requirement. The variables used are split_self and token_self, which are present in the dataset. \n\nNow, checking the dataset variables: token_self is available, split_self is available. combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), but we don't need to compute that since 3*token_self is straightforward. \n\nThis model would predict that the utility of accepting increases with higher split_self, but decreases when the offer is below the participant's contribution (3*token_self), with the penalty proportional to the deficit. \n\nIn terms of psychological principles, this model incorporates self-interest (split_self) and fairness based on equity, with a focus on loss aversion (penalizing only when below equity). \n\nComparing to previous models, Model 2 uses (split_self - 3*token_self), which is linear in both directions. The proposed model here only penalizes when below equity, which is a different approach. \n\nAnother possible model is to use the ratio of split_self to the equity value. For example, U_accept = alpha * split_self + beta * (split_self / (3 * token_self)). If split_self is less than equity, the ratio is less than 1, and beta (negative) would reduce utility. But this introduces a division which might lead to instability if token_self is zero. However, in the dataset, token_self is the number of tokens found by the participant, which is likely always positive. \n\nBut using a ratio might complicate parameter interpretation. The max function approach is simpler and more robust. \n\nSo the proposed model is:\n\nU_accept = alpha * split_self + beta * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nParameters alpha (positive) and beta (negative). \n\nNow, the variables in the model are split_self (data variable), token_self (data variable), and the calculated term max(3*token_self - split_self, 0). \n\nThe parameters alpha and beta are learnable. The ranges for alpha could be [0, 10] (since higher values mean more sensitivity to money), and beta could be [-10, 0] (since it's a penalty for being below equity). These ranges are generous but finite. \n\nThis model uses two parameters, which is allowed. It doesn't include any stochasticity parameters. It's applicable to the dataset as all variables are present. \n\nNow, checking if this model has been tried before. Looking at previous models:\n\nModel 2: linear term (split_self - 3*token_self). The proposed model uses max(3*token_self - split_self, 0), which is a different term. So this is a new model. \n\nThe summary would explain that the utility combines absolute monetary gain with a penalty for offers below the participant's equitable contribution, capturing loss aversion relative to contribution-based fairness. \n\nSo the final model is:\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = alpha * split_self + beta * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n</MODEL>\n\nVariables:\n\n- alpha: learnable, positive, range [0, 10]\n- beta: learnable, negative, range [-10, 0]\n- split_self: data variable\n- token_self: data variable\n- max(3*token_self - split_self, 0): calculated term\n\nThe variable descriptions in JSON format would list each variable used in the model.

  "full_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts the utility of accepting an offer for the responder in the given experiment. The model needs to be based on psychological principles, use the dataset variables appropriately, and have no more than two learnable parameters. Also, it should avoid parameters for stochasticity since that's handled later by a temperature parameter.\n\nFirst, let's review the previous models to see what's been done already. \n\nModel 1 used split_self and a fairness term based on the deviation from the contribution-based percentage. Model 2 considered split_self and deviation from the participant's contribution (3*token_self). Model 3 added a proportional term to Model 2. Model 4 focused on inequity aversion between split_self and split_opp. Model 5 scaled the fairness term by the participant's contribution proportion.\n\nLooking at these, Models 2 and 3 are contribution-based, Model 4 is inequity aversion, and Model 5 combines contribution and proportion. The BIC scores suggest that Model 2 and Model 4 have better performance, but Model 4's parameter recovery for beta was poor. \n\nNow, considering psychological principles, fairness and self-interest are key. The responder's utility likely depends on both the absolute amount they receive (split_self) and how fair that amount is relative to some standard. Previous models have used equity (based on contributions) or equality (equal split) as fairness references. \n\nIn the dataset, each trial's combined_earning is variable, so equal splits (split_self = split_opp) might not be the same as equity-based splits (based on tokens contributed). The token_self and token_opp variables represent contributions, so equity would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. But combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so split_self should be compared to 3*token_self if contributions are the basis for equity. \n\nWait, combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so each token is worth \u00a33. So the participant's contribution is 3*token_self, and the opponent's is 3*token_opp. The total is combined_earning. So equity would suggest that each should get their contribution. But in the task, the split is proposed, so the responder evaluates if split_self is fair compared to their contribution. \n\nAlternatively, fairness could be based on the proportion of the total contributions. For example, if the participant contributed 60% of the tokens, they might expect 60% of the combined earnings. But combined_earning is 3*(sum of tokens), so 60% of that would be 3*(sum)*0.6. But split_self is the amount offered. So the fair share based on contribution would be (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. But since combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), this simplifies to 3*token_self. So split_self should equal 3*token_self for equity. \n\nSo Models 2 and 3 use 3*token_self as the equity reference. Model 2 uses the difference (split_self - 3*token_self), while Model 3 uses the proportional difference. \n\nAnother angle is the difference between the proposed split and the equal split. For example, if combined_earning is 30, an equal split would be 15 each. But if the participant contributed more tokens, maybe they expect more than half. However, trial_type indicates whether contributions were equal, opponent more, or participant more. But trial_type is a categorical variable. Maybe participants have different fairness standards based on trial_type. But the model needs to use variables in the dataset, and trial_type is available. However, using trial_type might complicate the model with more parameters. Since the model is limited to two parameters, perhaps trial_type isn't directly used but the fairness is calculated based on tokens. \n\nAnother psychological principle is loss aversion. If the proposed split_self is less than the equity value (3*token_self), the participant might perceive it as a loss, leading to a stronger negative reaction. So the disutility from unfairness could be nonlinear, but the model needs to be linear in parameters. Alternatively, the model could have a term that is the difference between split_self and equity, but only when split_self is less than equity. \n\nWait, Model 4 uses max functions for inequity aversion. But in Model 4, the parameters alpha and beta are for disadvantageous and advantageous inequality. However, in the responder's case, when they are deciding to accept or reject, they might only care about disadvantageous inequality (if they get less than the proposer). But Model 4's beta parameter (for advantageous inequality) had poor recovery, suggesting it's not as relevant. \n\nSo maybe focusing on disadvantageous inequality relative to equity. For example, the utility could be split_self minus a penalty when split_self is less than the equity value (3*token_self). The penalty could be scaled by a parameter. \n\nAlternatively, the model could combine the absolute monetary gain (split_self) with a term that represents the deviation from equity, but only when the offer is below equity. This would capture the idea that participants are sensitive to being shortchanged relative to their contribution. \n\nSo the utility could be:\n\nU_accept = alpha * split_self + beta * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, alpha is the sensitivity to monetary gain, and beta (negative) would represent the aversion to offers below their contribution. If the offer is below equity, the max term becomes positive, and multiplied by beta (which should be negative) reduces the utility. If beta is positive, that would imply they like being below equity, which doesn't make sense, so beta should be constrained to be negative. \n\nBut the problem states that the model should have parameters with finite bounds. So beta's range could be from, say, -10 to 0. \n\nAnother consideration is whether to normalize the equity term. For example, if the equity difference is (3*token_self - split_self), this could be a large value depending on the tokens. Maybe scaling it by something, but the model needs to be simple. \n\nLooking at previous models, Model 2 uses (split_self - 3*token_self), which is the same as -(3*token_self - split_self). So if beta is negative in Model 2, then a lower split_self would decrease utility. But in Model 2, the term is (split_self - 3*token_self), so if split_self is less than 3*token_self, this term is negative, and multiplied by beta (which in Model 2's case, if beta is negative, the product becomes positive, which would increase utility? Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me check Model 2 again.\n\nModel 2's specification is U_accept = alpha * split_self + beta * (split_self - 3 * token_self). So if split_self is less than 3*token_self, the term (split_self - 3*token_self) is negative. If beta is a learnable parameter, say negative, then beta*(negative term) becomes positive, which would increase utility. That doesn't make sense because getting less than equity should decrease utility. So perhaps in Model 2, beta is expected to be positive. But if beta is positive, then when split_self is less than equity, the term is negative, leading to lower utility. Wait, no: if beta is positive, then beta*(split_self - equity) would be negative when split_self < equity, thus reducing utility. That makes sense. So in Model 2, beta is a positive parameter, and higher beta means more penalty for being below equity. \n\nBut in the current task, the user wants to design a model that hasn't been tried yet. Since Model 2 already uses the linear term (split_self - 3*token_self), perhaps a different approach is needed. \n\nAnother angle is to consider the ratio between split_self and the equity value. For example, split_self / (3*token_self). If this ratio is less than 1, the participant is getting less than their contribution. The utility could then be alpha * split_self + beta * (split_self / (3*token_self)). But this introduces a division, which might complicate parameter recovery. However, this would capture proportional fairness. \n\nAlternatively, using a reference-dependent model where the reference point is the equity value. The utility is split_self plus a term that depends on whether split_self is above or below the reference. For example, U = split_self + beta * (split_self >= 3*token_self ? 0 : (3*token_self - split_self)). But this is similar to the max function. \n\nWait, the max function approach: U_accept = alpha * split_self + beta * max(3*token_self - split_self, 0). Here, if the offer is below equity, the max term is positive, and beta (which would be negative) reduces the utility. If the offer is above equity, the max term is zero, so only split_self matters. This captures loss aversion relative to the equity reference. \n\nThis model would have two parameters: alpha (sensitivity to monetary gain) and beta (sensitivity to losses below equity). The parameters need to be bounded. For alpha, it's logical to have a positive value since higher split_self should increase utility. Beta should be negative because when the offer is below equity, the max term is positive, and multiplying by a negative beta would subtract from utility. \n\nThis model hasn't been tried in the previous models. Model 2 uses a linear term, which could be positive or negative. The max function would only penalize when below equity, which might better capture loss aversion. \n\nAnother consideration is the interaction between split_self and the equity term. For example, maybe the disutility is proportional to how much they are below equity. The max term captures that. \n\nSo the model would be:\n\nU_accept = alpha * split_self + beta * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nHere, alpha is positive, beta is negative. \n\nThis model uses two parameters, which fits the requirement. The variables used are split_self and token_self, which are present in the dataset. \n\nNow, checking the dataset variables: token_self is available, split_self is available. combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), but we don't need to compute that since 3*token_self is straightforward. \n\nThis model would predict that the utility of accepting increases with higher split_self, but decreases when the offer is below the participant's contribution (3*token_self), with the penalty proportional to the deficit. \n\nIn terms of psychological principles, this model incorporates self-interest (split_self) and fairness based on equity, with a focus on loss aversion (penalizing only when below equity). \n\nComparing to previous models, Model 2 uses (split_self - 3*token_self), which is linear in both directions. The proposed model here only penalizes when below equity, which is a different approach. \n\nAnother possible model is to use the ratio of split_self to the equity value. For example, U_accept = alpha * split_self + beta * (split_self / (3 * token_self)). If split_self is less than equity, the ratio is less than 1, and beta (negative) would reduce utility. But this introduces a division which might lead to instability if token_self is zero. However, in the dataset, token_self is the number of tokens found by the participant, which is likely always positive. \n\nBut using a ratio might complicate parameter interpretation. The max function approach is simpler and more robust. \n\nSo the proposed model is:\n\nU_accept = alpha * split_self + beta * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n\nParameters alpha (positive) and beta (negative). \n\nNow, the variables in the model are split_self (data variable), token_self (data variable), and the calculated term max(3*token_self - split_self, 0). \n\nThe parameters alpha and beta are learnable. The ranges for alpha could be [0, 10] (since higher values mean more sensitivity to money), and beta could be [-10, 0] (since it's a penalty for being below equity). These ranges are generous but finite. \n\nThis model uses two parameters, which is allowed. It doesn't include any stochasticity parameters. It's applicable to the dataset as all variables are present. \n\nNow, checking if this model has been tried before. Looking at previous models:\n\nModel 2: linear term (split_self - 3*token_self). The proposed model uses max(3*token_self - split_self, 0), which is a different term. So this is a new model. \n\nThe summary would explain that the utility combines absolute monetary gain with a penalty for offers below the participant's equitable contribution, capturing loss aversion relative to contribution-based fairness. \n\nSo the final model is:\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = alpha * split_self + beta * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)\n</MODEL>\n\nVariables:\n\n- alpha: learnable, positive, range [0, 10]\n- beta: learnable, negative, range [-10, 0]\n- split_self: data variable\n- token_self: data variable\n- max(3*token_self - split_self, 0): calculated term\n\nThe variable descriptions in JSON format would list each variable used in the model.

The utility of accepting an offer depends linearly on the proposed amount (split_self) and incorporates a penalty for offers below the participant's equitable contribution (3 * token_self). The penalty term activates only when split_self < 3 * token_self, capturing asymmetric sensitivity to disadvantageous inequality. Two parameters control sensitivity to money (alpha \u2265 0) and fairness violations (beta \u2264 0), with beta quantifying aversion to offers below one's contribution.\nBIC: 31.092498427958233\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- alpha: r = 0.836\n- beta: r = 0.836"
