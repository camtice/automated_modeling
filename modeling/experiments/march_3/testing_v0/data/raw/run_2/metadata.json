      "output": "Let's think step-by-step about a computational model for responder behavior in this bargaining game.\n\n**Key Psychological Mechanisms:**\n\n1. **Equity/Fairness:**  Responders are likely sensitive to the fairness of the offer, considering both the absolute amount received (`split_self`) and the proportional share relative to contributions (`split_perc_self` and the ratio of tokens).  Inequity aversion is a well-established psychological principle.\n\n2. **Self-Interest:** Responders will prioritize maximizing their own monetary gain. This is captured by the absolute amount offered (`split_self`).\n\n3. **Relative Contributions:** The relative contributions of the participants (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) plays a crucial role in judging fairness.  An offer that seems fair when contributions are equal might seem unfair when contributions are unequal.\n\n\n**How These Mechanisms Interact:**\n\nThe model should incorporate both fairness and self-interest.  The relative contributions should moderate the impact of both absolute and proportional fairness considerations.  A highly unequal contribution might lead to a higher acceptance threshold for proportional fairness, while a more equal contribution might lead to lower tolerance for unequal splits.\n\n**Mathematical Form:**\n\nA multiplicative model can capture these interactions effectively. The utility of accepting an offer can be modeled as the product of the absolute gain and a fairness term modulated by the relative contributions.  This allows the influence of fairness to vary depending on the contribution ratio.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1.  `gain_weight`: This parameter reflects the importance of the absolute monetary gain to the responder. A higher value indicates a greater emphasis on self-interest. (Learnable)\n\n2. `fairness_sensitivity`: This parameter captures the responder's sensitivity to fairness. A higher value indicates a greater aversion to unfair offers (Learnable).\n\n**Mapping to Observable Behavior:**\n\nHigher values of `gain_weight` will lead to higher utility for larger offers, regardless of fairness. Higher values of `fairness_sensitivity` will penalize offers perceived as unfair, reducing utility even if the absolute monetary gain is substantial. The interaction of these parameters with the relative contribution ratio will determine the acceptance threshold for different offers.\n\n<MODEL>\nU = gain_weight * split_self * (1 - fairness_sensitivity * abs(split_perc_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"gain_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to absolute monetary gain\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Amount of money offered to the participant (\u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"fairness_sensitivity\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to fairness; higher values indicate greater aversion to unfair offers\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_perc_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Percentage share offered to the participant (%)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA multiplicative utility model for responder acceptance decisions.

  "full_reasoning": "Let's think step-by-step about a computational model for responder behavior in this bargaining game.\n\n**Key Psychological Mechanisms:**\n\n1. **Equity/Fairness:**  Responders are likely sensitive to the fairness of the offer, considering both the absolute amount received (`split_self`) and the proportional share relative to contributions (`split_perc_self` and the ratio of tokens).  Inequity aversion is a well-established psychological principle.\n\n2. **Self-Interest:** Responders will prioritize maximizing their own monetary gain. This is captured by the absolute amount offered (`split_self`).\n\n3. **Relative Contributions:** The relative contributions of the participants (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) plays a crucial role in judging fairness.  An offer that seems fair when contributions are equal might seem unfair when contributions are unequal.\n\n\n**How These Mechanisms Interact:**\n\nThe model should incorporate both fairness and self-interest.  The relative contributions should moderate the impact of both absolute and proportional fairness considerations.  A highly unequal contribution might lead to a higher acceptance threshold for proportional fairness, while a more equal contribution might lead to lower tolerance for unequal splits.\n\n**Mathematical Form:**\n\nA multiplicative model can capture these interactions effectively. The utility of accepting an offer can be modeled as the product of the absolute gain and a fairness term modulated by the relative contributions.  This allows the influence of fairness to vary depending on the contribution ratio.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1.  `gain_weight`: This parameter reflects the importance of the absolute monetary gain to the responder. A higher value indicates a greater emphasis on self-interest. (Learnable)\n\n2. `fairness_sensitivity`: This parameter captures the responder's sensitivity to fairness. A higher value indicates a greater aversion to unfair offers (Learnable).\n\n**Mapping to Observable Behavior:**\n\nHigher values of `gain_weight` will lead to higher utility for larger offers, regardless of fairness. Higher values of `fairness_sensitivity` will penalize offers perceived as unfair, reducing utility even if the absolute monetary gain is substantial. The interaction of these parameters with the relative contribution ratio will determine the acceptance threshold for different offers.\n\n<MODEL>\nU = gain_weight * split_self * (1 - fairness_sensitivity * abs(split_perc_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100))\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"gain_weight\": {\n      \"description\": \"Weight given to absolute monetary gain\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Amount of money offered to the participant (\u00a3)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"fairness_sensitivity\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to fairness; higher values indicate greater aversion to unfair offers\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_perc_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Percentage share offered to the participant (%)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the participant\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Number of tokens found by the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA multiplicative utility model for responder acceptance decisions.
