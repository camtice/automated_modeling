      "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts the utility of accepting an offer for the responder in the given experiment. The model needs to be based on psychological principles, use the dataset variables appropriately, and have no more than two learnable parameters. Also, it should avoid parameters for stochasticity since that's handled later by a temperature parameter.\n\nFirst, I need to focus on responder behavior. The previous model (Model 1) considered both monetary gain (split_self) and fairness based on the participant's contribution (3 * token_self). The fairness component was about underpayment, penalizing offers below the fair share. But maybe there's another angle here. Let's think about other psychological mechanisms.\n\nAnother key principle could be inequity aversion. People might dislike unequal outcomes, even if they're advantageous. So, they might reject offers that are unfair, even if it means getting less money. But in this case, the responder's utility might depend on both their own share and the opponent's share relative to contributions.\n\nWait, the dataset has variables like token_self and token_opp, which represent the contributions. The combined_earning is the total, which is 3*(token_self + token_opp). The split_self and split_opp are the proposed splits. So, fairness could be comparing the split percentages to the contribution percentages. For example, if the participant contributed 50% of the tokens, a fair split would be 50% of the combined earnings. If the split_self is less than that, it's unfair.\n\nSo maybe the utility should compare the proposed percentage (splitperc_self) to the contribution percentage. The contribution percentage would be token_self / (token_self + token_opp) * 100. The difference between splitperc_self and this contribution percentage could be a factor. If the split is below the contribution percentage, that's unfair, and the responder might have negative utility. If it's above, maybe positive.\n\nAlternatively, the model could calculate the fair share as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Then compare split_self to this fair share. The difference (split_self - fair_share) could be a term in the utility. If split_self is less than fair_share, the difference is negative, reducing utility. If it's more, it's positive, increasing utility.\n\nBut the previous model used 3 * token_self as the fair share, which is the participant's own contribution in pounds. However, the combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so the fair share based on contribution would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. That's actually equal to 3 * token_self, because combined_earning is 3*(sum of tokens). So (token_self / sum) * 3*sum = 3*token_self. So the previous model's fair share is equivalent to this contribution-based fair share. So maybe that's redundant.\n\nBut perhaps the previous model only considered underpayment (split_self < 3*token_self). What if the responder also cares about overpayment? Like, if they get more than their fair share, does that increase utility? The previous model's term was max(3*token_self - split_self, 0), which only penalizes when split_self is less than 3*token_self. But maybe the responder's utility is linear in the difference between split_self and their fair share. So split_self - 3*token_self. If that's positive, utility increases; if negative, decreases. But then, the model would have a term like theta*(split_self) + alpha*(split_self - 3*token_self). Wait, but that's combining two terms related to split_self. Maybe that's redundant. Alternatively, maybe the model should have split_self (monetary gain) and the difference between split_self and fair share (fairness). But that's two terms. However, the previous model already uses split_self and the underpayment term. So perhaps another angle is needed.\n\nAnother psychological principle is reciprocity. If the proposer is offering a split that's generous relative to the contributions, the responder might feel positive reciprocity, increasing utility. But how to quantify that? Maybe the proposer's split_opp (their own share) compared to their contribution. If the proposer is keeping more than their fair share, that's unfair. So the responder's utility could depend on both their own split and the proposer's split relative to their contributions.\n\nWait, the split_opp is the opponent's proposed share. So if the opponent contributed token_opp tokens, their fair share would be 3*token_opp. The split_opp is how much they're taking. If split_opp is more than 3*token_opp, that's the proposer being greedy. The responder might dislike that. So the utility could be split_self (monetary gain) minus a term that penalizes the proposer's greediness (split_opp - 3*token_opp) if it's positive. So the model would be U = theta*split_self - alpha*max(split_opp - 3*token_opp, 0). This way, the responder cares about their own gain and how much the proposer is taking beyond their fair share. This introduces a different fairness component: not just underpayment to self, but overpayment to the proposer.\n\nThis model would have two parameters: theta (sensitivity to own monetary gain) and alpha (aversion to the proposer's unfairness). This is different from the previous model which focused on underpayment to self. This model focuses on the proposer's overpayment. This could be a different psychological mechanism, testing whether responders are more sensitive to the proposer's greediness than their own underpayment.\n\nAlternatively, combining both underpayment to self and overpayment to the proposer. But that would require three parameters (theta, alpha, beta), which exceeds the two-parameter limit. So perhaps pick one or the other.\n\nAnother angle: the ratio of the splits to contributions. For example, the responder's split_self divided by their contribution (3*token_self) and the proposer's split_opp divided by their contribution (3*token_opp). If the ratio for self is less than 1, that's bad. If the ratio for opp is greater than 1, that's also bad. So the utility could be split_self + alpha*(split_self/(3*token_self) - 1) + beta*(split_opp/(3*token_opp) - 1). But again, parameters could add up. But with two parameters, maybe combine these terms.\n\nAlternatively, the model could use the difference between the split percentage and the contribution percentage. For example, the responder's contribution percentage is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The split percentage is splitperc_self. The difference (splitperc_self - contribution_percent) could be a term. If positive, it's favorable; if negative, unfavorable. Similarly for the proposer's splitperc_opp. But splitperc_opp is 100 - splitperc_self, so maybe redundant.\n\nWait, splitperc_opp is the percentage the opponent is taking. So if the opponent's contribution is token_opp, their contribution percentage is (token_opp / total_tokens) * 100. The splitperc_opp is their proposed percentage. The difference between splitperc_opp and their contribution percentage could be a measure of unfairness. If splitperc_opp is higher than their contribution percentage, that's unfair. So the responder's utility could be influenced by both their own underpayment and the proposer's overpayment.\n\nBut again, combining these would require two parameters. For example, U = theta*split_self + alpha*(splitperc_self - self_contribution_percent) + beta*(splitperc_opp - opp_contribution_percent). But with two parameters, maybe theta and alpha. But perhaps the model can combine these terms. For example, the total unfairness could be the sum of (splitperc_self - self_contribution_percent) and (splitperc_opp - opp_contribution_percent). But since splitperc_opp is 100 - splitperc_self, and opp_contribution_percent is 100 - self_contribution_percent, then (splitperc_opp - opp_contribution_percent) = (100 - splitperc_self) - (100 - self_contribution_percent) = self_contribution_percent - splitperc_self. So the sum of the two terms would be (splitperc_self - self_contribution_percent) + (self_contribution_percent - splitperc_self) = 0. So that approach might not work. Therefore, perhaps focusing on one term.\n\nAlternatively, the model could consider the difference between the split percentage and the contribution percentage for the responder. So, splitperc_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. If this is positive, the responder is getting more than their contribution; if negative, less. The utility could be split_self (monetary gain) plus a term that scales this difference. So U = theta*split_self + alpha*(splitperc_self - contribution_percent). This way, theta captures the weight on monetary gain, and alpha captures the weight on fairness relative to contribution. If alpha is positive, getting more than fair share increases utility; if negative, the opposite. Wait, but in reality, people might prefer to have more than their fair share, so alpha could be positive. But if they have fairness concerns, they might have a negative utility when splitperc_self is below contribution_percent. Hmm, maybe the model should penalize deviations from the fair split, regardless of direction. But that would require absolute value, which complicates the model. Alternatively, perhaps only penalize when splitperc_self is below contribution_percent, similar to the previous model. So the term would be max(contribution_percent - splitperc_self, 0), multiplied by a parameter. Then the utility is U = theta*split_self - alpha*max(contribution_percent - splitperc_self, 0). This way, if the split is below the contribution percentage, the responder feels negative utility proportional to the difference. This is similar to the previous model but uses percentage instead of absolute amounts. But in the previous model, the fair share was 3*token_self, which is equivalent to (token_self / total_tokens) * combined_earning. So the split_self is compared to the fair share in absolute terms. Here, using percentages might be a different approach. However, since splitperc_self is already a percentage, and contribution_percent is (token_self / total_tokens)*100, the difference is in percentage points. So the model would have U = theta*split_self - alpha*max( (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)*100) - splitperc_self, 0 ). This captures the idea that the responder is sensitive to receiving less than their contribution percentage. Theta is the weight on the monetary gain, alpha is the weight on the fairness violation (underpayment in percentage terms). This is a variation of the previous model but using percentages instead of absolute values. However, since split_self is in pounds, and splitperc_self is a percentage, combining them might require scaling. Alternatively, maybe the model should use split_self for monetary gain and the percentage difference for fairness. But combining pounds and percentages might not be straightforward. Theta would scale the monetary term, and alpha would scale the percentage difference. But the units are different. However, parameters can absorb scaling factors. For example, if the percentage difference is 10%, alpha would multiply that, and theta would multiply split_self (which is in pounds). The parameters would adjust the relative weights. This could work. \n\nAlternatively, using the split_self compared to the fair share in pounds. The fair share is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Since combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), the fair share is 3*token_self. So split_self - 3*token_self is the difference. If split_self is less than 3*token_self, the difference is negative. So the model could be U = theta*split_self + alpha*(split_self - 3*token_self). But this combines two terms that are both in pounds. Theta and alpha would be weights. However, this could lead to collinearity if split_self and (split_self - 3*token_self) are correlated. For example, if split_self increases, the second term also increases if 3*token_self is fixed. But maybe in the dataset, split_self varies independently of 3*token_self. Alternatively, the model could be U = theta*split_self + alpha*max(3*token_self - split_self, 0). Wait, that's exactly the previous model. So perhaps that's already covered.\n\nThe previous model used U_accept = theta * split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0). So theta is the utility of the monetary gain, and alpha is the penalty for being underpaid relative to their contribution. The current task is to design a model that builds on relevant psychological principles, possibly different from the previous one. Since the previous model already uses underpayment relative to contribution, maybe the next model should consider a different fairness aspect, like the proposer's share relative to their contribution.\n\nSo, the proposer's fair share would be 3*token_opp. The split_opp is the amount the proposer is taking. If split_opp > 3*token_opp, that's the proposer taking more than their contribution. The responder might dislike this. So the utility could be U = theta*split_self - alpha*max(split_opp - 3*token_opp, 0). Here, theta is the weight on own monetary gain, and alpha is the aversion to the proposer's overpayment. This model captures the idea that responders care not only about their own share but also about the proposer's fairness in taking more than they contributed. This is a different fairness mechanism than the previous model, focusing on the proposer's greediness rather than the responder's underpayment.\n\nThis model would have two parameters: theta and alpha. Theta is positive (more money is better), alpha is positive (penalty for proposer's overpayment). The ranges could be theta in [0, some upper bound], alpha similarly. The variables used are split_self (from data), split_opp (data), token_opp (data). The term max(split_opp - 3*token_opp, 0) represents the proposer's overpayment. If the proposer is taking more than their contribution, this term is positive, reducing the utility of accepting. So even if the responder's split_self is acceptable, if the proposer is being unfair to themselves, the responder might reject.\n\nThis model introduces a different psychological mechanism: aversion to the proposer's unfairness towards themselves. It's a form of inequity aversion where the responder dislikes the proposer's excessive share. This hasn't been covered in the previous model, so it's a new angle.\n\nAnother possibility is combining both own underpayment and proposer's overpayment. But that would require three parameters (theta, alpha, beta), which exceeds the two-parameter limit. So we can't do that here. Therefore, focusing on one fairness component.\n\nAlternatively, the model could use the ratio of the proposer's split to their contribution. For example, (split_opp / (3*token_opp)) - 1. If this is positive, the proposer is taking more than their contribution. The utility could be U = theta*split_self - alpha*max( (split_opp / (3*token_opp)) - 1, 0 ). This is similar to the previous idea but scaled by the contribution. However, this introduces division, which might complicate parameter recovery. But the parameters can adjust for scaling.\n\nBut using split_opp - 3*token_opp is simpler and in the same units as split_self (pounds). So perhaps that's better for identifiability.\n\nSo the model would be:\n\nU_accept = theta * split_self - alpha * max( split_opp - 3 * token_opp, 0 )\n\nVariables needed: split_self, split_opp, token_opp.\n\nParameters: theta (learnable), alpha (learnable). Both must have bounds. Theta is the sensitivity to own monetary gain, so it's reasonable to have a positive value. Alpha is the aversion to proposer's overpayment, also positive. So their ranges could be theta in [0, 10], alpha in [0, 10], with inclusive bounds. These ranges are generous but plausible.\n\nThis model uses two parameters, which is within the limit. It's based on the responder's own gain and their aversion to the proposer's unfair overpayment. This is a different mechanism than the previous model, which focused on the responder's own underpayment. This allows testing whether responders are more sensitive to their own underpayment or the proposer's overpayment.\n\nNow, checking if all variables used are present in the dataset. split_self is available (float64), split_opp (float64), token_opp (int64). Yes. So the model is feasible with the given variables.\n\nAnother consideration: the combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So split_self + split_opp = combined_earning. Therefore, split_opp = combined_earning - split_self. But split_opp is already a variable in the dataset, so we can use it directly.\n\nIn terms of parameter recovery, having two parameters (theta and alpha) that are not highly correlated is important. If split_self and split_opp - 3*token_opp are not perfectly correlated, the parameters can be recovered. For example, in cases where split_self is high but split_opp is also high (more than 3*token_opp), the responder's utility would be a balance between the two terms. The model would need data where these variables vary independently to estimate theta and alpha accurately.\n\nThe utility function is linear in parameters, which is good for identifiability. The model is parsimonious with two parameters, which is allowed. It doesn't include any stochasticity parameters, as per the requirements.\n\nSo the final model would be:\n\nU_accept = theta * split_self - alpha * max( split_opp - 3 * token_opp, 0 )\n\nVariables:\n\n- theta: learnable, range [0, 10]\n- alpha: learnable, range [0, 10]\n- split_self: from data\n- split_opp: from data\n- token_opp: from data\n\nThis model captures the responder's utility based on their own monetary gain and their aversion to the proposer taking more than their fair share. The parameters theta and alpha can be estimated from the data, and their values would indicate the relative importance of these two factors in the responder's decision to accept or reject.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = theta * split_self - alpha * max(split_opp - 3 * token_opp, 0)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"theta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to monetary gain from accepted offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Aversion to proposer's overpayment relative to their contribution\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for opponent in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Opponent's token contribution (each token = \u00a33)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model capturing responder behavior through two mechanisms: direct monetary gain (split_self) and aversion to proposer's unfair retention of funds exceeding their contribution-based fair share (3 * token_opp).

  "full_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts the utility of accepting an offer for the responder in the given experiment. The model needs to be based on psychological principles, use the dataset variables appropriately, and have no more than two learnable parameters. Also, it should avoid parameters for stochasticity since that's handled later by a temperature parameter.\n\nFirst, I need to focus on responder behavior. The previous model (Model 1) considered both monetary gain (split_self) and fairness based on the participant's contribution (3 * token_self). The fairness component was about underpayment, penalizing offers below the fair share. But maybe there's another angle here. Let's think about other psychological mechanisms.\n\nAnother key principle could be inequity aversion. People might dislike unequal outcomes, even if they're advantageous. So, they might reject offers that are unfair, even if it means getting less money. But in this case, the responder's utility might depend on both their own share and the opponent's share relative to contributions.\n\nWait, the dataset has variables like token_self and token_opp, which represent the contributions. The combined_earning is the total, which is 3*(token_self + token_opp). The split_self and split_opp are the proposed splits. So, fairness could be comparing the split percentages to the contribution percentages. For example, if the participant contributed 50% of the tokens, a fair split would be 50% of the combined earnings. If the split_self is less than that, it's unfair.\n\nSo maybe the utility should compare the proposed percentage (splitperc_self) to the contribution percentage. The contribution percentage would be token_self / (token_self + token_opp) * 100. The difference between splitperc_self and this contribution percentage could be a factor. If the split is below the contribution percentage, that's unfair, and the responder might have negative utility. If it's above, maybe positive.\n\nAlternatively, the model could calculate the fair share as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Then compare split_self to this fair share. The difference (split_self - fair_share) could be a term in the utility. If split_self is less than fair_share, the difference is negative, reducing utility. If it's more, it's positive, increasing utility.\n\nBut the previous model used 3 * token_self as the fair share, which is the participant's own contribution in pounds. However, the combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so the fair share based on contribution would be (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. That's actually equal to 3 * token_self, because combined_earning is 3*(sum of tokens). So (token_self / sum) * 3*sum = 3*token_self. So the previous model's fair share is equivalent to this contribution-based fair share. So maybe that's redundant.\n\nBut perhaps the previous model only considered underpayment (split_self < 3*token_self). What if the responder also cares about overpayment? Like, if they get more than their fair share, does that increase utility? The previous model's term was max(3*token_self - split_self, 0), which only penalizes when split_self is less than 3*token_self. But maybe the responder's utility is linear in the difference between split_self and their fair share. So split_self - 3*token_self. If that's positive, utility increases; if negative, decreases. But then, the model would have a term like theta*(split_self) + alpha*(split_self - 3*token_self). Wait, but that's combining two terms related to split_self. Maybe that's redundant. Alternatively, maybe the model should have split_self (monetary gain) and the difference between split_self and fair share (fairness). But that's two terms. However, the previous model already uses split_self and the underpayment term. So perhaps another angle is needed.\n\nAnother psychological principle is reciprocity. If the proposer is offering a split that's generous relative to the contributions, the responder might feel positive reciprocity, increasing utility. But how to quantify that? Maybe the proposer's split_opp (their own share) compared to their contribution. If the proposer is keeping more than their fair share, that's unfair. So the responder's utility could depend on both their own split and the proposer's split relative to their contributions.\n\nWait, the split_opp is the opponent's proposed share. So if the opponent contributed token_opp tokens, their fair share would be 3*token_opp. The split_opp is how much they're taking. If split_opp is more than 3*token_opp, that's the proposer being greedy. The responder might dislike that. So the utility could be split_self (monetary gain) minus a term that penalizes the proposer's greediness (split_opp - 3*token_opp) if it's positive. So the model would be U = theta*split_self - alpha*max(split_opp - 3*token_opp, 0). This way, the responder cares about their own gain and how much the proposer is taking beyond their fair share. This introduces a different fairness component: not just underpayment to self, but overpayment to the proposer.\n\nThis model would have two parameters: theta (sensitivity to own monetary gain) and alpha (aversion to the proposer's unfairness). This is different from the previous model which focused on underpayment to self. This model focuses on the proposer's overpayment. This could be a different psychological mechanism, testing whether responders are more sensitive to the proposer's greediness than their own underpayment.\n\nAlternatively, combining both underpayment to self and overpayment to the proposer. But that would require three parameters (theta, alpha, beta), which exceeds the two-parameter limit. So perhaps pick one or the other.\n\nAnother angle: the ratio of the splits to contributions. For example, the responder's split_self divided by their contribution (3*token_self) and the proposer's split_opp divided by their contribution (3*token_opp). If the ratio for self is less than 1, that's bad. If the ratio for opp is greater than 1, that's also bad. So the utility could be split_self + alpha*(split_self/(3*token_self) - 1) + beta*(split_opp/(3*token_opp) - 1). But again, parameters could add up. But with two parameters, maybe combine these terms.\n\nAlternatively, the model could use the difference between the split percentage and the contribution percentage. For example, the responder's contribution percentage is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. The split percentage is splitperc_self. The difference (splitperc_self - contribution_percent) could be a term. If positive, it's favorable; if negative, unfavorable. Similarly for the proposer's splitperc_opp. But splitperc_opp is 100 - splitperc_self, so maybe redundant.\n\nWait, splitperc_opp is the percentage the opponent is taking. So if the opponent's contribution is token_opp, their contribution percentage is (token_opp / total_tokens) * 100. The splitperc_opp is their proposed percentage. The difference between splitperc_opp and their contribution percentage could be a measure of unfairness. If splitperc_opp is higher than their contribution percentage, that's unfair. So the responder's utility could be influenced by both their own underpayment and the proposer's overpayment.\n\nBut again, combining these would require two parameters. For example, U = theta*split_self + alpha*(splitperc_self - self_contribution_percent) + beta*(splitperc_opp - opp_contribution_percent). But with two parameters, maybe theta and alpha. But perhaps the model can combine these terms. For example, the total unfairness could be the sum of (splitperc_self - self_contribution_percent) and (splitperc_opp - opp_contribution_percent). But since splitperc_opp is 100 - splitperc_self, and opp_contribution_percent is 100 - self_contribution_percent, then (splitperc_opp - opp_contribution_percent) = (100 - splitperc_self) - (100 - self_contribution_percent) = self_contribution_percent - splitperc_self. So the sum of the two terms would be (splitperc_self - self_contribution_percent) + (self_contribution_percent - splitperc_self) = 0. So that approach might not work. Therefore, perhaps focusing on one term.\n\nAlternatively, the model could consider the difference between the split percentage and the contribution percentage for the responder. So, splitperc_self - (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * 100. If this is positive, the responder is getting more than their contribution; if negative, less. The utility could be split_self (monetary gain) plus a term that scales this difference. So U = theta*split_self + alpha*(splitperc_self - contribution_percent). This way, theta captures the weight on monetary gain, and alpha captures the weight on fairness relative to contribution. If alpha is positive, getting more than fair share increases utility; if negative, the opposite. Wait, but in reality, people might prefer to have more than their fair share, so alpha could be positive. But if they have fairness concerns, they might have a negative utility when splitperc_self is below contribution_percent. Hmm, maybe the model should penalize deviations from the fair split, regardless of direction. But that would require absolute value, which complicates the model. Alternatively, perhaps only penalize when splitperc_self is below contribution_percent, similar to the previous model. So the term would be max(contribution_percent - splitperc_self, 0), multiplied by a parameter. Then the utility is U = theta*split_self - alpha*max(contribution_percent - splitperc_self, 0). This way, if the split is below the contribution percentage, the responder feels negative utility proportional to the difference. This is similar to the previous model but uses percentage instead of absolute amounts. But in the previous model, the fair share was 3*token_self, which is equivalent to (token_self / total_tokens) * combined_earning. So the split_self is compared to the fair share in absolute terms. Here, using percentages might be a different approach. However, since splitperc_self is already a percentage, and contribution_percent is (token_self / total_tokens)*100, the difference is in percentage points. So the model would have U = theta*split_self - alpha*max( (token_self/(token_self + token_opp)*100) - splitperc_self, 0 ). This captures the idea that the responder is sensitive to receiving less than their contribution percentage. Theta is the weight on the monetary gain, alpha is the weight on the fairness violation (underpayment in percentage terms). This is a variation of the previous model but using percentages instead of absolute values. However, since split_self is in pounds, and splitperc_self is a percentage, combining them might require scaling. Alternatively, maybe the model should use split_self for monetary gain and the percentage difference for fairness. But combining pounds and percentages might not be straightforward. Theta would scale the monetary term, and alpha would scale the percentage difference. But the units are different. However, parameters can absorb scaling factors. For example, if the percentage difference is 10%, alpha would multiply that, and theta would multiply split_self (which is in pounds). The parameters would adjust the relative weights. This could work. \n\nAlternatively, using the split_self compared to the fair share in pounds. The fair share is (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. Since combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), the fair share is 3*token_self. So split_self - 3*token_self is the difference. If split_self is less than 3*token_self, the difference is negative. So the model could be U = theta*split_self + alpha*(split_self - 3*token_self). But this combines two terms that are both in pounds. Theta and alpha would be weights. However, this could lead to collinearity if split_self and (split_self - 3*token_self) are correlated. For example, if split_self increases, the second term also increases if 3*token_self is fixed. But maybe in the dataset, split_self varies independently of 3*token_self. Alternatively, the model could be U = theta*split_self + alpha*max(3*token_self - split_self, 0). Wait, that's exactly the previous model. So perhaps that's already covered.\n\nThe previous model used U_accept = theta * split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0). So theta is the utility of the monetary gain, and alpha is the penalty for being underpaid relative to their contribution. The current task is to design a model that builds on relevant psychological principles, possibly different from the previous one. Since the previous model already uses underpayment relative to contribution, maybe the next model should consider a different fairness aspect, like the proposer's share relative to their contribution.\n\nSo, the proposer's fair share would be 3*token_opp. The split_opp is the amount the proposer is taking. If split_opp > 3*token_opp, that's the proposer taking more than their contribution. The responder might dislike this. So the utility could be U = theta*split_self - alpha*max(split_opp - 3*token_opp, 0). Here, theta is the weight on own monetary gain, and alpha is the aversion to the proposer's overpayment. This model captures the idea that responders care not only about their own share but also about the proposer's fairness in taking more than they contributed. This is a different fairness mechanism than the previous model, focusing on the proposer's greediness rather than the responder's underpayment.\n\nThis model would have two parameters: theta and alpha. Theta is positive (more money is better), alpha is positive (penalty for proposer's overpayment). The ranges could be theta in [0, some upper bound], alpha similarly. The variables used are split_self (from data), split_opp (data), token_opp (data). The term max(split_opp - 3*token_opp, 0) represents the proposer's overpayment. If the proposer is taking more than their contribution, this term is positive, reducing the utility of accepting. So even if the responder's split_self is acceptable, if the proposer is being unfair to themselves, the responder might reject.\n\nThis model introduces a different psychological mechanism: aversion to the proposer's unfairness towards themselves. It's a form of inequity aversion where the responder dislikes the proposer's excessive share. This hasn't been covered in the previous model, so it's a new angle.\n\nAnother possibility is combining both own underpayment and proposer's overpayment. But that would require three parameters (theta, alpha, beta), which exceeds the two-parameter limit. So we can't do that here. Therefore, focusing on one fairness component.\n\nAlternatively, the model could use the ratio of the proposer's split to their contribution. For example, (split_opp / (3*token_opp)) - 1. If this is positive, the proposer is taking more than their contribution. The utility could be U = theta*split_self - alpha*max( (split_opp / (3*token_opp)) - 1, 0 ). This is similar to the previous idea but scaled by the contribution. However, this introduces division, which might complicate parameter recovery. But the parameters can adjust for scaling.\n\nBut using split_opp - 3*token_opp is simpler and in the same units as split_self (pounds). So perhaps that's better for identifiability.\n\nSo the model would be:\n\nU_accept = theta * split_self - alpha * max( split_opp - 3 * token_opp, 0 )\n\nVariables needed: split_self, split_opp, token_opp.\n\nParameters: theta (learnable), alpha (learnable). Both must have bounds. Theta is the sensitivity to own monetary gain, so it's reasonable to have a positive value. Alpha is the aversion to proposer's overpayment, also positive. So their ranges could be theta in [0, 10], alpha in [0, 10], with inclusive bounds. These ranges are generous but plausible.\n\nThis model uses two parameters, which is within the limit. It's based on the responder's own gain and their aversion to the proposer's unfair overpayment. This is a different mechanism than the previous model, which focused on the responder's own underpayment. This allows testing whether responders are more sensitive to their own underpayment or the proposer's overpayment.\n\nNow, checking if all variables used are present in the dataset. split_self is available (float64), split_opp (float64), token_opp (int64). Yes. So the model is feasible with the given variables.\n\nAnother consideration: the combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So split_self + split_opp = combined_earning. Therefore, split_opp = combined_earning - split_self. But split_opp is already a variable in the dataset, so we can use it directly.\n\nIn terms of parameter recovery, having two parameters (theta and alpha) that are not highly correlated is important. If split_self and split_opp - 3*token_opp are not perfectly correlated, the parameters can be recovered. For example, in cases where split_self is high but split_opp is also high (more than 3*token_opp), the responder's utility would be a balance between the two terms. The model would need data where these variables vary independently to estimate theta and alpha accurately.\n\nThe utility function is linear in parameters, which is good for identifiability. The model is parsimonious with two parameters, which is allowed. It doesn't include any stochasticity parameters, as per the requirements.\n\nSo the final model would be:\n\nU_accept = theta * split_self - alpha * max( split_opp - 3 * token_opp, 0 )\n\nVariables:\n\n- theta: learnable, range [0, 10]\n- alpha: learnable, range [0, 10]\n- split_self: from data\n- split_opp: from data\n- token_opp: from data\n\nThis model captures the responder's utility based on their own monetary gain and their aversion to the proposer taking more than their fair share. The parameters theta and alpha can be estimated from the data, and their values would indicate the relative importance of these two factors in the responder's decision to accept or reject.\n</think>\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = theta * split_self - alpha * max(split_opp - 3 * token_opp, 0)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility of accepting the offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"theta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Sensitivity to monetary gain from accepted offer\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Aversion to proposer's overpayment relative to their contribution\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for participant in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed share for opponent in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"token_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"Opponent's token contribution (each token = \u00a33)\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\"\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA utility model capturing responder behavior through two mechanisms: direct monetary gain (split_self) and aversion to proposer's unfair retention of funds exceeding their contribution-based fair share (3 * token_opp).

The model uses two learnable parameters: theta scales the utility of monetary gain, while alpha penalizes proposer overpayment. This captures self-interest and third-party fairness considerations, with constrained parameter ranges to support identifiability.\nBIC: 31.030933393301368\n\nParameter Recovery:\n- theta: r = 0.801\n- alpha: r = 0.848"
