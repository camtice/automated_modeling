2,31.030933393301368,,,"U_accept = theta * split_self - alpha * max(split_opp - 3 * token_opp, 0)","A utility model capturing responder behavior through two mechanisms: direct monetary gain (split_self) and aversion to proposer's unfair retention of funds exceeding their contribution-based fair share (3 * token_opp). The model uses two learnable parameters: theta scales the utility of monetary gain, while alpha penalizes proposer overpayment. This captures self-interest and third-party fairness considerations, with constrained parameter ranges to support identifiability.",v1,0.8007167309705872,0.8475324119658872
1,31.58304081194221,,,"U_accept = theta * split_self - alpha * max(3 * token_self - split_self, 0)","A utility model capturing responder behavior by combining monetary gain (split_self) and aversion to underpayment relative to contribution-based fairness. The fair share is defined as 3 * token_self (each token = Â£3). The model uses two learnable parameters: theta scales the utility of money, and alpha penalizes deviations below the fair share. This captures both self-interest and fairness considerations, with parameters constrained to plausible ranges to aid identifiability.",v1,0.8088880235771785,0.9042672153171015
