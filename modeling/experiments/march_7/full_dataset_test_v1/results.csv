1,,,,U_action = psi * combined_earning * (1 - proposed_perc/100) - theta * (proposed_perc - (token_opp/(token_self + token_opp))*100)^2,This model computes the utility of proposer actions as a trade-off between self-interest and fairness. The utility is the weighted monetary gain from retaining a larger share of the combined earning minus a penalty for deviating from a fairness norm (derived as the opponent’s tokens relative to total tokens). Two learnable parameters—psi for self-interest and theta for fairness sensitivity—are used to calibrate this trade-off.,v1
