1,,,,"Let p denote the percentage proposed to the opponent (proposed_perc). Then the monetary share for the proposer is:
  S = ((100 − p)/100) × combined_earning

The fairness ideal share (in monetary terms) is given by:
  F = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) × combined_earning

The utility of a proposal is then:
  U = beta × S − alpha × (S − F)²","A utility model for proposer behavior that combines a linear valuation of the monetary self share with a quadratic penalty for deviating from the fairness ideal. The fairness ideal is computed as the share of the combined earning proportional to the participant’s token contribution. Two learnable parameters, beta and alpha, govern the weight on monetary benefits and the aversion to fairness deviation, respectively.",v1
