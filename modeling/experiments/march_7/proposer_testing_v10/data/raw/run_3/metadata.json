      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Psychological mechanisms: The Fehr\u2013Schmidt model posits that responders care not only about their material payoff (their share, split_self) but also about the fairness of the distribution. In particular, responders experience disutility proportional to the unequal share when the opponent\u2019s share (split_opp) exceeds their own. In this dataset, as split_self is always less than split_opp in offers received by the responder, only the disadvantageous inequality aversion (envy) matters.\n2. Mechanism interaction: The utility for accepting an offer is derived from the material payoff decreased by a penalty that scales with the magnitude of the inequality if the opponent\u2019s share is higher.\n3. Mathematical form: A linear formulation capturing these effects is U = split_self \u2212 \u03b1*(split_opp \u2212 split_self). This can be rearranged as U = (1 + \u03b1)*split_self \u2212 \u03b1*split_opp.\n4. Learnable parameter: \u03b1 (alpha) represents the responder\u2019s aversion to being disadvantaged by the opponent\u2019s higher share. We impose finite bounds such as [0, 10] on alpha.\n5. Observable behavior mapping: Higher values of U (utility for accepting) should be associated with a greater likelihood of acceptance. The model thus connects observable proposal splits (split_self, split_opp) with the latent utility computed by the model.\n\nBelow is the formal specification.\n\n<MODEL>\nU = (1 + alpha)*split_self - alpha*split_opp\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility for accepting the offer, computed from the proposer\u2019s and responder\u2019s splits\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Disadvantageous inequality aversion parameter; higher values indicate stronger aversion to receiving less than the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"lower\": 0,\n          \"upper\": 10\n        }\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The proposed share for the participant (responder) in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"The proposed share for the opponent (proposer) in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA Fehr\u2013Schmidt model for the responder in the ultimatum game where the utility from accepting an offer is a linear function of the responder\u2019s share reduced by an inequality penalty when the opponent\u2019s share exceeds the responder\u2019s share, captured by a single learnable parameter alpha.\n</SUMMARY>"

  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Psychological mechanisms: The Fehr\u2013Schmidt model posits that responders care not only about their material payoff (their share, split_self) but also about the fairness of the distribution. In particular, responders experience disutility proportional to the unequal share when the opponent\u2019s share (split_opp) exceeds their own. In this dataset, as split_self is always less than split_opp in offers received by the responder, only the disadvantageous inequality aversion (envy) matters.\n2. Mechanism interaction: The utility for accepting an offer is derived from the material payoff decreased by a penalty that scales with the magnitude of the inequality if the opponent\u2019s share is higher.\n3. Mathematical form: A linear formulation capturing these effects is U = split_self \u2212 \u03b1*(split_opp \u2212 split_self). This can be rearranged as U = (1 + \u03b1)*split_self \u2212 \u03b1*split_opp.\n4. Learnable parameter: \u03b1 (alpha) represents the responder\u2019s aversion to being disadvantaged by the opponent\u2019s higher share. We impose finite bounds such as [0, 10] on alpha.\n5. Observable behavior mapping: Higher values of U (utility for accepting) should be associated with a greater likelihood of acceptance. The model thus connects observable proposal splits (split_self, split_opp) with the latent utility computed by the model.\n\nBelow is the formal specification.\n\n<MODEL>\nU = (1 + alpha)*split_self - alpha*split_opp\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U\": {\n      \"description\": \"Utility for accepting the offer, computed from the proposer\u2019s and responder\u2019s splits\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"alpha\": {\n      \"description\": \"Disadvantageous inequality aversion parameter; higher values indicate stronger aversion to receiving less than the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"distribution\": {\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"lower\": 0,\n          \"upper\": 10\n        }\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The proposed share for the participant (responder) in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"The proposed share for the opponent (proposer) in \u00a3\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA Fehr\u2013Schmidt model for the responder in the ultimatum game where the utility from accepting an offer is a linear function of the responder\u2019s share reduced by an inequality penalty when the opponent\u2019s share exceeds the responder\u2019s share, captured by a single learnable parameter alpha.\n</SUMMARY>",
