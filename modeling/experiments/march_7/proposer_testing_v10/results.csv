3,109.17353716056826,,,U = (1 + alpha)*split_self - alpha*split_opp,"A Fehr–Schmidt model for the responder in the ultimatum game where the utility from accepting an offer is a linear function of the responder’s share reduced by an inequality penalty when the opponent’s share exceeds the responder’s share, captured by a single learnable parameter alpha.",v10,0.828791440681966
1,,,,U_accept = split_self - beta*(split_self - split_opp),The model computes the utility of accepting an offer based on the monetary gain and a fairness penalty for advantageous inequality using the Fehr-Schmidt formulation. It includes one learnable parameter (beta) that scales the penalty associated with receiving more than the opponent.,v10,
2,,,,U_accept = split_self - beta * (split_self - split_opp),"A model of responder behavior based on the Fehr–Schmidt framework that computes the utility of accepting an offer. The utility is the monetary gain adjusted by a fairness cost proportional to the difference between the responder’s and proposer’s shares, with a single learnable parameter (beta) capturing advantageous inequality aversion.",v10,
