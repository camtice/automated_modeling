      "output": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Psychological Mechanisms: In the Ultimatum Game, responders care not only about the absolute amount they receive, but also about the fairness of the split relative to their opponent\u2019s share. The Fehr-Schmidt model captures inequity aversion where receiving more than the opponent can induce a negative utility due to guilt or concerns over fairness.\n2. Mechanism interaction: The responder\u2019s utility increases with the absolute amount received (split_self) but is reduced as the difference (split_self - split_opp) increases, reflecting aversion to advantageous inequity.\n3. Mathematical form: The classic Fehr-Schmidt model defines the utility as U = x_i - beta * max{x_i - x_j, 0}. Given the dataset condition that split_self is always greater than split_opp (ensuring that max{x_i - x_j, 0} = split_self - split_opp), the utility simplifies to U = split_self - beta*(split_self - split_opp).\n4. Parameters needed: Only one learnable parameter, beta, is needed to capture the aversion to advantageous inequity. A generous bound (e.g., [0,5]) is set for beta.\n5. Mapping to observable behavior: Observable values split_self and split_opp from the dataset determine the utility of accepting offers. A higher computed utility increases the likelihood of acceptance, while a negative utility (if the difference is too pronounced) signals rejection even though the responder would receive some amount.\n\nBelow is the formal mathematical model encapsulated between the required tags.\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = split_self - beta * (split_self - split_opp)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Calculated utility of accepting an offer as per the Fehr-Schmidt model\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The proposed share for the participant in \u00a3, representing the absolute amount received\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"The proposed share for the opponent in \u00a3, representing the opponent's amount\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Learnable inequity aversion parameter; reflects the disutility from receiving more than the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA simplified Fehr-Schmidt model for responder behavior in the Ultimatum Game, capturing aversion to advantageous inequity.

The model computes the utility of accepting an offer as the recipient's share reduced by a penalty proportional to the difference between the recipient's and opponent's shares.",
  "full_reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Psychological Mechanisms: In the Ultimatum Game, responders care not only about the absolute amount they receive, but also about the fairness of the split relative to their opponent\u2019s share. The Fehr-Schmidt model captures inequity aversion where receiving more than the opponent can induce a negative utility due to guilt or concerns over fairness.\n2. Mechanism interaction: The responder\u2019s utility increases with the absolute amount received (split_self) but is reduced as the difference (split_self - split_opp) increases, reflecting aversion to advantageous inequity.\n3. Mathematical form: The classic Fehr-Schmidt model defines the utility as U = x_i - beta * max{x_i - x_j, 0}. Given the dataset condition that split_self is always greater than split_opp (ensuring that max{x_i - x_j, 0} = split_self - split_opp), the utility simplifies to U = split_self - beta*(split_self - split_opp).\n4. Parameters needed: Only one learnable parameter, beta, is needed to capture the aversion to advantageous inequity. A generous bound (e.g., [0,5]) is set for beta.\n5. Mapping to observable behavior: Observable values split_self and split_opp from the dataset determine the utility of accepting offers. A higher computed utility increases the likelihood of acceptance, while a negative utility (if the difference is too pronounced) signals rejection even though the responder would receive some amount.\n\nBelow is the formal mathematical model encapsulated between the required tags.\n\n<MODEL>\nU_accept = split_self - beta * (split_self - split_opp)\n</MODEL>\n\n<VARIABLES>\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"U_accept\": {\n      \"description\": \"Calculated utility of accepting an offer as per the Fehr-Schmidt model\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": \"-inf\",\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"calculated\"\n    },\n    \"split_self\": {\n      \"description\": \"The proposed share for the participant in \u00a3, representing the absolute amount received\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"split_opp\": {\n      \"description\": \"The proposed share for the opponent in \u00a3, representing the opponent's amount\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": \"inf\",\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": false\n      },\n      \"learnable\": false,\n      \"source\": \"data\"\n    },\n    \"beta\": {\n      \"description\": \"Learnable inequity aversion parameter; reflects the disutility from receiving more than the opponent\",\n      \"range\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"inclusive_min\": true,\n        \"inclusive_max\": true\n      },\n      \"learnable\": true,\n      \"source\": \"learnable\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</VARIABLES>\n\n<SUMMARY>\nA simplified Fehr-Schmidt model for responder behavior in the Ultimatum Game, capturing aversion to advantageous inequity.
