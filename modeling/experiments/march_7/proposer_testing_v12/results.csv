1,140.89453768428905,,,U_accept = split_self - beta * (split_self - split_opp),"A simplified Fehr-Schmidt model for responder behavior in the Ultimatum Game, capturing aversion to advantageous inequity. The model computes the utility of accepting an offer as the recipient's share reduced by a penalty proportional to the difference between the recipient's and opponent's shares.",v12,0.6589901871714268

3,,,,U_accept = split_self - beta*(split_self - split_opp),A Fehr-Schmidt-inspired model for responder behavior that computes the utility of accepting an offer by subtracting a penalty term—proportional to the difference between the responder’s and opponent’s monetary shares—from the offered amount. The single learnable parameter (beta) captures sensitivity to advantageous inequality.,v12,
