1,,,,U_accept = split_self - beta_param*(split_self - split_opp),"A Fehr-Schmidt-based utility model for responder behavior in the ultimatum game. The model computes the utility of accepting an offer as the monetary share minus a penalty for advantageous inequality, scaled by a single learnable parameter.",v13
2,,,,U_accept = split_self - beta * (split_self - split_opp),"A Fehr-Schmidt model for responder acceptance that computes utility as the monetary offer to the responder reduced by a penalty proportional to the advantageous inequity (the difference between the responder's and opponent's shares), with a single learnable parameter beta governing the aversion to inequity.",v13
3,,,,U = split_self - beta_param*(split_self - split_opp),"A Fehr–Schmidt-inspired utility model for responder behavior in the Ultimatum Game, where the responder’s utility equals their monetary share reduced by a penalty for advantageous inequality. The model uses one learnable parameter (beta_param) to capture inequality aversion.",v13
