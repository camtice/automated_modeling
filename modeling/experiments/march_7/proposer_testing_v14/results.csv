1,,,,U = split_self - beta*(split_self - split_opp),"A utility model for responder behavior in the ultimatum game where the utility of accepting an offer is computed as the monetary share (split_self) reduced by a guilt penalty proportional to the inequality (split_self – split_opp), weighted by a learnable parameter (beta).",v14
2,,,,U_accept = split_self - beta * (split_self - split_opp),"The model computes the utility for accepting an offer in the Ultimatum Game as the responder’s proposed share reduced by a penalty for advantageous inequality, captured by a single learnable parameter beta. This captures fairness concerns using only variables from the dataset.",v14
