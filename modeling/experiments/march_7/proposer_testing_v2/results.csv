1,83.73226512871645,,,"Let f = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning.
Let d = split_self - f.
Then, the utility of accepting an offer is defined as:
  U_accept = split_self - alpha * max(f - split_self, 0) - beta * max(split_self - f, 0).",The model computes the responder’s utility for accepting an offer as the proposed monetary share minus a fairness penalty. The fairness penalty is proportional to the deviation from a fair share—calculated as the participant’s tokens relative to the total tokens—and is weighted differently when the offer is below (using parameter alpha) or above (using parameter beta) the fair share. Two learnable parameters with generous finite bounds capture these sensitivities.,v2,0.8520143560137372,
