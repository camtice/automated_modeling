U_accept = split_self – alpha × max(F – split_self, 0) – beta × max(split_self – F, 0)","The model computes the utility of accepting an offer by comparing the allocated monetary split (split_self) against a fairness benchmark, which is computed as the proportional contribution (token_self relative to token_self plus token_opp) multiplied by the total available earnings (combined_earning). Two learnable sensitivity parameters (alpha and beta) penalize deviations from this fair share, with separate weights for disadvantageous versus advantageous deviations. This formalization captures fairness-driven decision processes in responder behavior.",v3,0.9414220861337868,0.35299621126859654
