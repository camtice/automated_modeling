2,140.890722112556,,,U = split_self - beta * (split_self - split_opp),A Fehr–Schmidt model for responders where the utility of accepting an offer equals the monetary reward minus a fairness penalty proportional to the amount by which the responder’s share exceeds the opponent’s share. This model uses a single learnable parameter representing aversion to advantageous inequality.,v8,0.46428504180995767
1,,,,U = split_self - beta*(split_self - split_opp),This model computes the responder’s utility for acceptance as the monetary offer (split_self) minus a penalty for the inequity between the responder and proposer (split_self minus split_opp) weighted by the learnable parameter beta. It reflects inequality aversion from advantageous inequality and is designed solely for responder behavior in the Ultimatum Game.,v8,
3,,,,U = split_self - beta*(split_self - split_opp),A Fehr–Schmidt inspired utility model for responders in the ultimatum game where the utility of accepting is given by the responder’s monetary offer (split_self) minus a fairness cost proportional to the difference with the proposer’s share (split_self – split_opp). The single learnable parameter beta regulates the aversion to advantageous inequality.,v8,
