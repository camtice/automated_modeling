1,,,,U = split_self - beta*(split_self - split_opp),"A simple Fehr–Schmidt model for responder behavior in the ultimatum game that computes the utility of accepting an offer as the monetary payoff minus a fairness penalty proportional to the advantageous inequality. Only one learnable parameter, beta, is used to quantify fairness aversion.",v9,
2,,,,U = split_self - beta*(split_self - split_opp),"The model calculates the utility for the responder by subtracting a penalty term, proportional to the difference between the recipient’s and opponent’s shares, from the monetary share received. This captures inequity aversion (advantageous inequality) with a single learnable parameter beta.",v9,
