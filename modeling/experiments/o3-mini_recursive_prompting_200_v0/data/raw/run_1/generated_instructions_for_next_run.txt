To improve model performance across BIC, parameter recovery, and overall prediction accuracy, we want to encourage the LLM to consider adjustments to the original model that address covariance issues between the learnable parameters. The new instructions should prompt the exploration of alternative representations of the utility function, possibly introducing simple transformations or additional scaling parameters to reduce parameter interdependence. We also want to further specify the intended psychological mechanisms and encourage out‐of‐the‐box ideas while still requiring a parsimonious model with only a few learnable parameters. For example, the LLM might consider normalizing the fairness difference (or including a variance parameter) or even introducing a bias term that shifts the expected fair share calculation. Emphasize using bounded priors to address covariance problems. Also, maintain an emphasis on modeling only observable responder choices and on explicit parameter bounds. This outcome should drive the modeling LLM to propose models that better capture psychological reasoning, incorporate careful parameter mapping, and avoid unnecessary complexity.

For run 2 of 200, please follow these updated instructions:

1. Carefully describe the psychological mechanisms underlying responder decision-making. Beyond a baseline bias and sensitivity to fairness deviations, consider that decision-making may benefit from normalization or rescaling of input differences (such as the difference between the offered share and expected fair share). Think about whether a non-linear transformation or additional scaling parameter might reduce covariance between learnable parameters.

2. Propose a mathematical model that remains parsimonious with minimal learnable parameters, but explore options beyond the simple linear relation. For instance, consider models that include a normalized fairness difference, a weighted scaling term, or a transformation (such as a square-root or logarithmic transform) of the fairness difference. Ideas that suggest including an extra parameter for scaling the fairness difference may be beneficial, provided that parameter is tightly bounded to avoid covariance issues.

3. Specify clear finite bounds for all learnable parameters (e.g., using generous uniform priors on well-defined intervals) and carefully justify or note any transformations or additional parameters aimed at reducing high covariance. Detail the psychological rationale behind any extra terms and how they capture the cognitive mechanisms that might affect the interpretation of fairness.

4. Ensure that the model directly predicts a latent utility from which a probability is generated using a logistic transformation. This latent utility must incorporate all relevant variables from the dataset – including proposing variables such as split_self, combined_earning, token_self, and token_opp – in a method that minimizes parameter interdependence.

5. Write out the formal mathematical model between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags. Then provide the variable descriptions in a JSON format between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags, making sure that all learnable parameters are clearly bounded.

6. Avoid including extraneous learnable parameters. The focus is to achieve higher accuracy, lower BIC, and improved parameter recovery by carefully tuning a minimal set of learnable parameters and, if needed, including a well-constrained additional scaling parameter on the fairness term to decouple its effect from the bias term.

7. Be creative and out-of-the-box. While the original model used a simple linear computation of the fairness difference, consider if incorporating a normalization term, a non-linear transformation, or even a dual-stage utility computation might improve model performance. Any proposed modifications should be motivated by the underlying psychological principles of fairness and decision-making.

Remember: Each modification must be grounded in the observable behavior of the participants and must be implementable solely with the provided dataset variables.

Good luck and think creatively to improve performance!
