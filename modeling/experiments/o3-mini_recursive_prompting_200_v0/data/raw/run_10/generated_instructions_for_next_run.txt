For run 11, we want to push the model’s performance even further by exploring a modified nonlinear transformation. Instead of the previous formulation, consider incorporating a slightly stronger fixed multiplier inside the logarithm to further enhance curvature in the mid-range while still ensuring smooth behavior near zero. For example, you might try a transformation of the form f(x) = sgn(x) × (|x|^(0.5) + log(1 + 3×|x|)). This change is designed to boost sensitivity when the fairness gap is moderate while preserving stability near zero. Maintain exactly three learnable parameters—beta, gamma, and phi—with the same bounds as before. The overall structure of the model remains: compute the normalized offer and fair share, derive the fairness gap F, scale F by phi, apply the nonlinear transformation f, compute latent utility U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi), and then transform U via the logistic function to obtain p_accept. You are encouraged to experiment with variations of the fixed multipliers or even consider adding a second fixed transformation term (as long as no extra learnable parameters are added) to further improve accuracy, lower the BIC, and enhance parameter recovery. Think creatively and flexibly about the transformation while satisfying the model constraints.

For run 11 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making with these requirements:

1. Compute the normalized offer percentage:
  N_offer = split_self/combined_earning,
  and the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self/(token_self+token_opp).

2. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer – N_share.

3. Apply a modified, nonlinear transformation f(·) to the fairness gap scaled by phi. For example, consider:
  f(x) = sgn(x) × (|x|^(0.5) + log(1 + 3×|x|)),
to potentially enhance model sensitivity in the mid-range and improve overall performance. You are encouraged to experiment with variations of this fixed transformation as long as the model retains only the three learnable parameters.

4. Use exactly three learnable parameters with these bounds:
  – beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  – gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  – phi (scaling) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

5. Define the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi)
  where F is the fairness gap computed above, and f(·) is your chosen nonlinear transformation.

6. Convert U into a choice probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).

7. Provide the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

8. Clearly indicate the predicted target variable in <target_variable> tags (set to “accept”).

Your goal is to achieve higher accuracy, reduced BIC, and improved parameter recovery by innovating with the transformation’s curvature. Think out-of-the-box while ensuring the model remains compliant with the data structure and learnable parameter constraints.
