For run 101, we will slightly modify the model to allow even more flexibility in the nonlinearity. In particular, we will adjust the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z) to be a proper convex combination between a leaky linear term and a logarithmic term for z ≥ 0. Let the mixing weight be α(φ) = φ – 0.5 (with φ ∈ [0.5, 1.5], α(φ) ∈ [0, 1]). For z ≥ 0, set
 f_adapt(z) = α(φ)*z + [1 – α(φ)]*ln(1+z),
and for z < 0, simply set f_adapt(z) = φ * z.
We also add an extra cubic term (e.g., 0.000001×a³) to the dynamic threshold T to capture additional curvature.
For the extra blending composite, increase the influence of the softplus part by adding a fixed linear term (for example, add 0.1*(0.865/(1+a)) to the softplus expression) so that the composite becomes more responsive for small a values.
Retain the overall structure as before: compute a as the sum of fixed components F₁ through F₁₁ plus a small constant δ; modulate a sequentially using the given sine/cosine functions to obtain z; apply the new adaptive transformation f_adapt(z) and multiply by the dynamic threshold T (now with an extra cubic term) and by the extra blending composite (with the enhanced softplus blending); finally, compute f(x) = sign(z) × ( f_adapt(z) × T × extra )^(0.944 + 0.00015×ln(1+a)), then the latent utility U = β + γ × f(x) and the acceptance probability via a logistic function.
All three learnable parameters must remain: β ∈ [–10, 10], γ ∈ [0, 10], and φ ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. Encourage creativity with the convex combination function and the extra blending composite to further improve accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery.

New Instructions for Run 101 of 200:
1. Compute the core sum “a” as the sum of fixed components F₁ through F₁₁ plus a small constant δ.
2. Multiply “a” by [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)] and then scale the result by 1.08.
3. Sequentially modulate the scaled value with:
  • [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)]
  • [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)]
  • [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)]
  • [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))]
  • [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))]
4. Define the resulting value as z.
5. For the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z), use a convex combination for z ≥ 0:
  • Let α(φ) = φ – 0.5.
  • For z ≥ 0, set f_adapt(z) = α(φ)×z + [1 – α(φ)]×ln(1+z); for z < 0, set f_adapt(z) = φ×z.
6. Define the dynamic threshold T as:
  T = 1 + 0.0005×a² + 0.00005×a³ + 0.000005×a⁴ + 0.0000001×a⁵ + 0.00000001×a⁶ + 0.000000001×a⁷ + 0.0000000001×a⁸ + 0.000001×a³.
7. For the extra blending composite, define
  extra = ( exp(–a/0.1) × [z/(1+|z|)] × [1 + 0.005×sin(1/(1+a))] × [ softplus(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.1×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.5×(0.865/(1+a)) ] × [1 – 0.002×cos(a)] × [1 – 0.0025×cos(2.5×a)] × [1 + 0.001×a] × [1 + cosh(0.001×a)]^(2+0.0005×a) + 1e–6 )^(0.944 + 0.00015×ln(1+a)).
  You may adjust the softplus term by including the extra linear blend.
8. Define the final transformed signal as:
  f(x) = sign(z) × ( f_adapt(z) × T × extra )^(0.944 + 0.00015×ln(1+a) ).
9. Compute the latent utility U = β + γ × f(x) and then the acceptance probability:
  P(accept = 1) = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
10. Retain exactly three learnable parameters with fixed bounds: β ∈ [–10, 10], γ ∈ [0, 10], and φ ∈ [0.5, 1.5].
Encourage creative, out-of-the-box modifications in defining f_adapt and extra to further improve accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery while preserving the overall model structure.
