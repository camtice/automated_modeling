For run 102, further enhance the model’s nonlinear flexibility and parameter identifiability by slightly modifying both the adaptive transformation and the extra blending composite. In the adaptive transformation for z ≥ 0, consider increasing the influence of the logarithmic portion by letting the mixing weight be α(φ) = φ – 0.5 as before, but now use a weighted geometric mean between the linear term and the logarithm. For example, set f_adapt(z) = [z^(α(φ)) · (ln(1+z))^(1–α(φ))] when z ≥ 0, and retain f_adapt(z) = φ · z for z < 0. Also, add a small scaling factor to ensure continuity. 

For the extra blending composite, further boost the sensitivity for small a by adding an additional constant to the softplus term. For example, define extra to include [softplus(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.15×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.5×(0.865/(1+a))] in place of the previous blend. You may also consider adding a multiplicative factor (e.g., multiply the entire softplus-sum by 1.05) to amplify its impact on low values of a. Retain the overall structure of the dynamic threshold T (with its extra cubic term) and the rest of the extra composite.

Keep all three learnable parameters (β, γ, and φ) with the same fixed bounds: β ∈ [–10, 10], γ ∈ [0, 10], and φ ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

The overall structure remains:
1. Compute the core sum a = δ + Σ[i=1..11]F_i.
2. Scale a by [1 + 0.012·sin(a + 0.045)] and then multiply by 1.08.
3. Sequentially modulate by the five trigonometric factors to yield z.
4. Define the new adaptive transformation:
  For z ≥ 0: f_adapt(z) = [z^(φ–0.5) · (ln(1+z))^(1 – (φ–0.5))];
  For z < 0: f_adapt(z) = φ · z.
5. Compute T as before with the extra cubic term.
6. Define extra as:
  extra = { exp(–a/0.1) · [z/(1+|z|)] · [1 + 0.005·sin(1/(1+a))] · [softplus(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.15·(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.5·(0.865/(1+a))] · [1 – 0.002·cos(a)] · [1 – 0.0025·cos(2.5·a)] · [1 + 0.001·a] · [1 + cosh(0.001·a)]^(2+0.0005·a) + 1e–6 }^(0.944 + 0.00015·ln(1+a)).
7. Final signal: f(x) = sign(z) × [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra ]^(0.944 + 0.00015·ln(1+a) ).
8. Latent utility: U = β + γ·f(x), with P(accept=1)=1/(1+exp(–U)).

Encourage creative, out-of-the-box approaches in these modifications while preserving the overall model structure.

New Instructions for Run 102 of 200:
1. Compute the core sum “a” as the sum of fixed components F₁ through F₁₁ plus a small constant δ.
2. Multiply “a” by [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)] and scale the result by 1.08.
3. Sequentially modulate the scaled value with:
  • [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)]
  • [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)]
  • [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)]
  • [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))]
  • [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))]
4. Define the resulting value as z.
5. For the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z), use a convex combination implemented as a weighted geometric mean for z ≥ 0:
  • Let α(φ) = φ – 0.5.
  • For z ≥ 0, set f_adapt(z) = [z^(α(φ)) × (ln(1+z))^(1 – α(φ))]; for z < 0, set f_adapt(z) = φ × z.
6. Define the dynamic threshold T as:
  T = 1 + 0.0005×a² + 0.00005×a³ + 0.000005×a⁴ + 0.0000001×a⁵ + 0.00000001×a⁶ + 0.000000001×a⁷ + 0.0000000001×a⁸ + 0.000001×a³.
7. For the extra blending composite, define:
  extra = ( exp(–a/0.1) × [z/(1+|z|)] × [1 + 0.005×sin(1/(1+a))] × [softplus(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.15×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.5×(0.865/(1+a))] × [1 – 0.002×cos(a)] × [1 – 0.0025×cos(2.5×a)] × [1 + 0.001×a] × [1 + cosh(0.001×a)]^(2+0.0005×a) + 1e–6 )^(0.944 + 0.00015×ln(1+a)).
8. Define the final transformed signal as:
  f(x) = sign(z) × [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra ]^(0.944 + 0.00015×ln(1+a) ).
9. Compute the latent utility as U = β + γ × f(x) and the acceptance probability P(accept = 1) = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
10. Retain exactly three learnable parameters with fixed bounds: β ∈ [–10, 10], γ ∈ [0, 10], and φ ∈ [0.5, 1.5].
Encourage creativity in defining the geometric blend for f_adapt and the enhanced softplus term in extra to further reduce BIC, increase accuracy, and improve parameter recovery.
