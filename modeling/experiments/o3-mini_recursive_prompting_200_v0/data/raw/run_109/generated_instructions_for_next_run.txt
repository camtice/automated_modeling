For run 110, our goal is to further optimize predictive performance, reduce BIC, and improve parameter recovery. Retain the overall structure of computing a core sum “a” from fixed components (F1 through F11) plus a small constant δ. Then multiply “a” by [1 + 0.012×sin(a + 0.045)] and scale by 1.08, followed by sequential modulations with the factors [1 + 0.008×cos(a + 0.065)], [1 + 0.005×sin(a + 0.115)], [1 + 0.004×cos(a + 0.085)], [1 + 0.006×(sin(a + 0.035)×cos(a + 0.055))], and [1 + 0.003×(sin(a + 0.03)×cos(a + 0.05))] to produce z.

For the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z), set w = (phi – 0.5) / phi. For z ≥ 0 compute f_adapt(z) = 1.002 × [z^w × (ln(1+z))^(1–w)]; for z < 0, use f_adapt(z) = phi × z.

Define a dynamic threshold T as a high‐order polynomial in a:
  T = 1 + 0.0005×a² + 0.00005×a³ + 0.000005×a⁴ + 0.0000001×a⁵ + 0.00000001×a⁶ + 0.000000001×a⁷ + 0.0000000001×a⁸ + 0.000001×a³.

In the extra blending composite, modify the design by increasing the linear term inside the bracket—from 0.005×a to 0.006×a—and add an additional harmonic smoothing factor (for example, multiply by [1 + 0.002×cos(0.5×a)]). Hence, define extra as:
  extra = { exp(–a/0.1) × [z/(1+|z|)] × [1 + 0.005×sin(1/(1+a))] × [1 + 0.002×cos(0.5×a)] × [1.07×softplus(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.15×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.5×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.006×a] × [1 – 0.002×cos(a)] × [1 – 0.0025×cos(2.5×a)] × [1 + 0.001×a] × [1 + cosh(0.001×a)]^(2+0.0005×a) + 1e–6 }^(0.9475 + 0.00017×ln(1+a)), but then slightly upgrade the exponent factor to 0.9478 + 0.00018×ln(1+a).

Finally, define the overall transformed signal f(x) as:
  f(x) = sign(z) × [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra ]^(0.9478 + 0.00018×ln(1+a)).

Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(x),
and the predicted acceptance probability as:
  P(accept=1) = 1 / (1 + exp(–U)).

Remember, use exactly three learnable parameters:
  • beta ∈ [–10, 10]
  • gamma ∈ [0, 10]
  • phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]

Additionally, if you wish to explore further non‐linear harmonic modulation (for example, another small term like 0.002×cos(0.5×a) inside extra), feel free to do so as long as the model remains tractable and interpretable.

These updated instructions should encourage out-of-the-box thinking while ensuring improved accuracy, lower BIC, and enhanced parameter recovery.

New Instructions for Run 110:
1. Compute the core sum “a” as the sum of fixed data‐derived components F1 through F11 plus a small constant δ.
2. Multiply “a” by [1 + 0.012×sin(a + 0.045)] and then scale it by 1.08.
3. Sequentially modulate the result using:
  • [1 + 0.008×cos(a + 0.065)]
  • [1 + 0.005×sin(a + 0.115)]
  • [1 + 0.004×cos(a + 0.085)]
  • [1 + 0.006×(sin(a + 0.035)×cos(a + 0.055))]
  • [1 + 0.003×(sin(a + 0.03)×cos(a + 0.05))]
Define the resulting value as z.
4. For the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z):
  • Let w = (phi – 0.5)/phi.
  • For z ≥ 0, set f_adapt(z) = 1.002 × [z^(w) × (ln(1+z))^(1–w)].
  • For z < 0, set f_adapt(z) = phi × z.
5. Define the dynamic threshold T as:
  T = 1 + 0.0005×a² + 0.00005×a³ + 0.000005×a⁴ + 0.0000001×a⁵ + 0.00000001×a⁶ + 0.000000001×a⁷ + 0.0000000001×a⁸ + 0.000001×a³.
6. In the extra blending composite, define extra as:
  extra = { exp(–a/0.1) × [z/(1+|z|)] × [1 + 0.005×sin(1/(1+a))] × [1 + 0.002×cos(0.5×a)] × [1.07×softplus(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.15×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.5×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.006×a] × [1 – 0.002×cos(a)] × [1 – 0.0025×cos(2.5×a)] × [1 + 0.001×a] × [1 + cosh(0.001×a)]^(2+0.0005×a) + 1e–6 }^(0.9478 + 0.00018×ln(1+a)).
7. Define the final transformed signal as:
  f(x) = sign(z) × [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra ]^(0.9478 + 0.00018×ln(1+a) ).
8. Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(x),
and then determine the acceptance probability:
  P(accept=1) = 1 / (1 + exp(–U)).
9. Use exactly three learnable parameters with fixed bounds:
  • beta ∈ [–10, 10]
  • gamma ∈ [0, 10]
  • phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]
10. Optionally, consider adding an additional small harmonic modulation (e.g. a term like 0.002×cos(0.5×a)) inside the extra composite if it benefits stability and parameter recovery.

Encourage creative and non–obvious model modifications while keeping the overall architecture tractable and interpretable.
