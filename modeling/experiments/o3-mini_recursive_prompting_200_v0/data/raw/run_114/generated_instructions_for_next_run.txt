For Run 115, further tweak the model by introducing additional nonlinear curvature in the rejection regime and enhancing mid‐range modulation. In particular, for negative z values, use a cubic adjustment (i.e. phi * (z³)) rather than a quadratic one so that the model more sharply differentiates low utility (reject) responses. Also, in the extra blending composite, include an additional harmonic modulation term [1 + 0.003×cos(0.3×a)] to further fine‐tune mid‐range sensitivity. Finally, modify the final exponent by multiplying it by [1 + 0.002×sin(2×a)] (instead of the previous 1 + 0.001×sin(2×a)) so that the compression of the transformed signal is modulated more aggressively. Retain the overall structure U = beta + gamma·f(x) and ensure that the three learnable parameters have fixed bounds: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. These changes are intended to further lower BIC, improve parameter recovery, and boost overall prediction accuracy by capturing additional nonlinear distortions in both very low (rejection) and middle utility ranges.

New Instructions for Run 115:
1. Compute the core sum “a” as the sum of fixed components F1 through F11 plus a small constant δ.
2. Multiply “a” by [1 + 0.012×sin(a + 0.045)] and scale by 1.08.
3. Sequentially modulate the result with these factors:
  • [1 + 0.008×cos(a + 0.065)]
  • [1 + 0.005×sin(a + 0.115)]
  • [1 + 0.004×cos(a + 0.085)]
  • [1 + 0.006×(sin(a + 0.035)×cos(a + 0.055))]
  • [1 + 0.003×(sin(a + 0.03)×cos(a + 0.05))]
Define the product as z.
4. Define the weight w = (phi – 0.5)/phi.
  • For z ≥ 0, set f_adapt(z) = 1.002 × [z^(w) × (ln(1+z))^(1–w)].
  • For z < 0, set f_adapt(z) = phi × (z³).
5. Define the dynamic threshold T as:
  T = 1 + 0.0005×a² + 0.00005×a³ + 0.000005×a⁴ + 0.0000001×a⁵ + 0.00000001×a⁶ + 0.000000001×a⁷ + 0.0000000001×a⁸ + 0.000001×a³.
6. In the extra blending composite, define extra as:
  extra = { exp(–a/0.1) × [z/(1+|z|)] × [1 + 0.005×sin(1/(1+a))] × [1 + 0.002×cos(0.5×a)] × [1 + 0.003×cos(0.3×a)] × [1 + 0.003×cos(0.3×a)] × [1.07×softplus(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.15×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.5×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.006×a] × [1 – 0.002×cos(a)] × [1 – 0.0025×cos(2.5×a)] × [1 + 0.001×a] × [1 + cosh(0.001×a)]^(2+0.0005×a) + 1e–6 }^(0.9478+0.00018×ln(1+a)).
  (Note: The additional factor [1 + 0.003×cos(0.3×a)] has been inserted to further tune mid-range sensitivity.)
7. Define the final exponent as:
  Exponent = [0.9478 + 0.00018×ln(1+a)] × [1 + 0.002×sin(2×a)].
8. Define the final transformed signal:
  f(x) = sign(z) × { [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra ]^(Exponent) }.
9. Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(x),
and then obtain:
  P(accept=1) = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
10. The model must use exactly three learnable parameters with these fixed bounds:
  • beta ∈ [–10, 10]
  • gamma ∈ [0, 10]
  • phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]

Feel free to experiment with additional novel modulation forms if beneficial, but ensure that the overall structure U = beta + gamma·f(x) is maintained and the parameter bounds remain fixed.
