For this run, we want to push the model further by incorporating additional nonlinear curvature both in the rejection regime and in enhancing mid‐range sensitivity. In particular, we will modify the adaptive transformation for negative z values to use a quartic adjustment (i.e. phi * z⁴) instead of the cubic, so that very low utilities (strong rejection) are even more sharply distinguished. In the extra blending composite, we add an extra harmonic modulation term [1 + 0.004×cos(0.3×a)] (in addition to the previous term) to further fine‐tune mid‐range sensitivity. Finally, we will further modify the final exponent by multiplying it by [1 + 0.003×sin(2×a)] so that the compression is modulated even more aggressively. Retain the overall structure U = beta + gamma·f(x) with exactly three learnable parameters: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. Use these modifications to further lower BIC, improve parameter recovery, and enhance prediction accuracy.

New Instructions for Run 117:
1. Compute the core sum “a” as the sum of fixed components F1 through F11 plus a small constant δ.
2. Multiply “a” by [1 + 0.012×sin(a + 0.045)] and scale by 1.08.
3. Sequentially modulate the result with these factors:
  • [1 + 0.008×cos(a + 0.065)]
  • [1 + 0.005×sin(a + 0.115)]
  • [1 + 0.004×cos(a + 0.085)]
  • [1 + 0.006×(sin(a + 0.035)×cos(a + 0.055))]
  • [1 + 0.003×(sin(a + 0.03)×cos(a + 0.05))]
Define the product as z.
4. Define the weight w = (phi – 0.5)/phi.
  • For z ≥ 0, set f_adapt(z) = 1.002 × [z^(w) × (ln(1+z))^(1–w)].
  • For z < 0, set f_adapt(z) = phi × (z^4).
5. Define the dynamic threshold T as:
  T = 1 + 0.0005×a² + 0.00005×a³ + 0.000005×a⁴ + 0.0000001×a⁵ + 0.00000001×a⁶ + 0.000000001×a⁷ + 0.0000000001×a⁸ + 0.000001×a³.
6. In the extra blending composite, define extra as:
  extra = { exp(–a/0.1) × [z/(1+|z|)] × [1 + 0.005×sin(1/(1+a))] × [1 + 0.002×cos(0.5×a)] × [1 + 0.003×cos(0.3×a)] × [1 + 0.003×cos(0.3×a)] × [1 + 0.004×cos(0.3×a)] × [1.07×softplus(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.15×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.5×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.006×a] × [1 – 0.002×cos(a)] × [1 – 0.0025×cos(2.5×a)] × [1 + 0.001×a] × [1 + cosh(0.001×a)]^(2+0.0005×a) + 1e–6 }^(0.9478+0.00018×ln(1+a)).
  (The extra [1 + 0.004×cos(0.3×a)] term is added here.)
7. Define the final exponent as:
  Exponent = [0.9478 + 0.00018×ln(1+a)] × [1 + 0.003×sin(2×a)].
8. Define the final transformed signal:
  f(x) = sign(z) × { [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra ]^(Exponent) }.
9. Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(x),
and then obtain:
  P(accept=1) = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
10. The model must use exactly three learnable parameters with these fixed bounds:
  • beta ∈ [–10, 10]
  • gamma ∈ [0, 10]
  • phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]

These instructions encourage out‐of‐the‐box adjustments to capture complex nonlinear effects, especially in deep rejection (very low utilities) via a quartic transformation and in mid‐range modulation via additional harmonic terms.
