For run 124, add an extra tanh term to the extra composite and incorporate an additional softsign correction for negative z by replacing the fixed 7th–power transformation with one that first shifts z, applies the softsign function, and then raises to the 7th power. Also, enrich T by appending both a⁹ and an a¹⁰ term to capture more extreme nonlinearity. Finally, incorporate an additional sine–cosine modulation factor in the final exponent—e.g., multiply by [1 + 0.003*sin(2.5*a) + 0.002*cos(3.5*a)]—to allow for extra harmonic flexibility. Retain exactly three learnable parameters with bounds: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

New Instructions for Run 124:

1. Compute the core sum “a” as the sum of fixed components F1 through F11 plus a small constant δ.
2. Compute a_mod = a × [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)] and then scale it by 1.08.
3. Sequentially modulate a_mod with:
  • [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)]
  • [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)]
  • [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)]
  • [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))]
  • [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))]
Define the product as z.
4. Define the weight w = (phi – 0.5) / phi.
  • For z ≥ 0, set f_adapt(z) = 1.002 × [z^w × (ln(1+z))^(1–w)].
  • For z < 0, set f_adapt(z) = phi × [softsign(z + Δ_shift)]^7, where softsign(x) = x/(1+|x|) and Δ_shift is a small constant.
5. Define the dynamic threshold T as an 8th–order polynomial in a with additional a⁹ and a¹⁰ terms:
  T = 1 + 0.0005×a² + 0.00005×a³ + 0.000005×a⁴ + 0.0000001×a⁵ + 0.00000001×a⁶ + 0.000000001×a⁷ + 0.0000000001×a⁸ + 0.000001×a³ + 0.0000001×a⁹ + 0.00000001×a¹⁰.
6. Define the extra blending composite extra as:
  extra = { exp(–a/0.1) × [z/(1+|z|)] × [1 + 0.005×sin(1/(1+a))] × [1 + 0.002×cos(0.5×a)] × ([1+0.003×cos(0.3×a)]²) × ([1+0.004×cos(0.3×a)]²) × [1+0.0025×cos(0.7×a)] × [1+tanh(0.05×a)] × [1.07×softplus(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.15×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.5×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.006×a] × [1 – 0.002×cos(a)] × [1 – 0.0025×cos(2.5×a)] × [1 + 0.001×a] × [1+cosh(0.001×a)]^(2+0.0005×a) + 1e–6 }^(0.9478 + 0.00018×ln(1+a)).
  Here, include an extra tanh-based correction factor if desired, for example multiplying by [1 + tanh(0.05×a)].
7. Define the final exponent as:
  Exponent = [0.9478 + 0.00018×ln(1+a)] × [1 + 0.003×sin(2×a) + 0.001×cos(3×a) + 0.0025×cos(0.7×a) + 0.004×sin(2.5×a) + 0.002×cos(3.5×a)].
8. Define the final transformed signal as:
  f(x) = sign(z) × { [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra ]^(Exponent) }.
9. Compute latent utility U = beta + gamma × f(x) and then compute the acceptance probability P(accept=1) = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
10. Retain exactly three learnable parameters with bounds: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Encourage creative, flexible nonlinear blends by considering alternative nonlinear functions (e.g., additional tanh or softsign elements within extra) to better capture extreme rejections and achieve lower BIC, improved parameter recovery, and higher accuracy.
