For this run, we want to push the model further by adding additional softsign corrections and an explicit clipping mechanism on the adaptive transformation for positive z‐values, while for the negative branch we increase the exponent (from 7 to 8) after applying a softsign correction. In addition, we extend the dynamic threshold T (including extra polynomial terms up to a^12 as before) and add an extra sigmoid factor and an extra tanh multiplier in the extra composite component to dampen extreme values even more. Finally, we update the final exponent to include an extra sine–cosine modulation term (e.g. an extra term with sin(2×a) or sin(2.5×a) plus a cosine term). Retain three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi) with bounds beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. This additional flexibility should help boost accuracy, lower the BIC, and achieve improved parameter recovery.

New Instructions for Run 129:
1. Compute the core sum “a” as the sum of fixed components F1 through F11 plus a small constant δ.
2. Compute a_mod = 1.08 × a × [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)].
3. Sequentially modulate a_mod with:
  • [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)]
  • [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)]
  • [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)]
  • [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))]
  • [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))]
Define the resulting product as z.
4. Set the weight w = (phi – 0.5) / phi.
  • For z ≥ 0, define the adaptive transformation as f_adapt(z) = 1.002 × [z^w × (ln(1+z))^(1–w)] multiplied by softsign(z) defined as z/(1+|z|); then explicitly clip the result between –100 and 100.
  • For z < 0, define f_adapt(z) = phi × [softsign(z + Δ_shift)]^8, where Δ_shift = 1×10^(-6).
5. Define a dynamic threshold T as an extended polynomial in a including terms up to a^12.
6. Define the extra composite term extra as:
  extra = { exp(–a/0.1) × [z/(1+|z|)] × [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1+a))] × [1 + 0.002 × cos(0.5×a)] × ([1+0.003×cos(0.3×a)]²) × ([1+0.004×cos(0.3×a)]²) × [1 + 0.0025×cos(0.7×a)] × [1 + tanh(0.05×a)] × [1 + sigmoid(0.01×a)] × [1.07×softplus(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.15×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.5×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.006×a] × [1 – 0.002×cos(a)] × [1 – 0.0025×cos(2.5×a)] × [1 + 0.001×a] × [1+cosh(0.001×a)]^(2+0.0005×a) + 1×10^(-6) }^(0.9478 + 0.00018×ln(1+a)) multiplied by [1 + tanh(0.05×a)].
7. Update the final exponent as:
  Exponent = [0.9478 + 0.00018×ln(1+a)] × [1 + 0.003×sin(2×a) + 0.001×cos(3×a) + 0.0025×cos(0.7×a) + 0.004×sin(2.5×a) + 0.002×cos(3.5×a) + 0.001×sin(2.5×a)×cos(3×a)].
8. Define the final transformed signal as:
  f(x) = sign(z) × { [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra ]^(Exponent) }.
9. Compute latent utility U = beta + gamma × f(x) and compute the acceptance probability as P(accept=1) = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
10. Retain exactly three learnable parameters with bounds: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].
