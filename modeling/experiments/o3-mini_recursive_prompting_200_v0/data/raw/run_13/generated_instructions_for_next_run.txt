For run 14, we want to further refine the model’s performance by encouraging exploration of even more nuanced fixed nonlinear transformations. In this iteration, prompt candidates to consider additional fixed components—such as a second damped exponential term or other fixed functions—to capture subtler curvature changes across the fairness gap. The key remains to maintain exactly three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi) with the same bounds. Emphasize the importance of using creative fixed transformation terms to potentially improve accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery.

For run 14 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making with the following requirements:

1. Compute the normalized offer percentage:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning,
  and the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

2. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer – N_share.

3. Apply a fixed nonlinear transformation f(·) to the scaled gap F/phi. You are encouraged to experiment with adding an additional fixed term to refine curvature, such as a second damped exponential or another fixed transformation component. For example, one might consider:
  f(x) = sgn(x) × [|x|^(0.5) + ln(1 + 3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1 - exp(-|x|)) + 0.05×(1 - exp(-2×|x|))]
but you may explore other variations as long as the total number of learnable parameters remains exactly three.

4. Use exactly three learnable parameters with these bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

5. Define the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi)
where f(·) is your chosen fixed nonlinear transformation applied to the scaled fairness gap.

6. Convert U into a choice probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(–U)).

7. Provide the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

8. Clearly indicate the predicted target variable in <target_variable> tags (set to “accept”).

Your goal is to achieve higher accuracy, a lower BIC, and improved parameter recovery. Feel free to think outside the box and explore creative fixed transformation components beyond the most common functions.
