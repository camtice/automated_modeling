For run 15, we want to push the boundaries even further by encouraging innovative fixed nonlinear transformations. Along with building on the previous structure, prompt the candidate to incorporate one or more additional fixed terms (for example, a fixed tanh or an additional damped exponential component with fixed coefficients) into the transformation f(·) applied to the normalized, scaled fairness gap. The goal is to better capture subtle nonlinearities across the fairness gap while keeping the learnable parameters limited exactly to beta, gamma, and phi with the same bounds. Be explicit that the model should compute normalized offer percentage and fair share, compute the fairness gap F, scale it by phi (learnable in [0.5, 1.5]), and then pass F/phi through a fixed function that can include curiosity-driven modifiers like a second damped exponential or hyperbolic functions to potentially improve accuracy, lower BIC, and add robustness to parameter recovery. Additionally, instruct that the latent utility is defined as U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi) and converted into a probability using the logistic function.

For run 15 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making with the following requirements:

1. Compute the normalized offer percentage:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning,
  and the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

2. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer – N_share.

3. Apply a fixed nonlinear transformation f(·) to the scaled gap F/phi. In this run, you are encouraged to incorporate additional fixed transformation terms to capture more nuanced curvature. For instance, in addition to components such as:
  |x|^(0.5), ln(1 + 3.4×|x|), 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|), 0.1×(1 - exp(-|x|)), and 0.05×(1 - exp(-2×|x|)),
consider adding an extra term such as 0.03×tanh(|x|) or another fixed damped exponential (with fixed coefficients) to model subtle curvature changes in the fairness gap. The design of the fixed function is entirely up to you, as long as no new learnable parameters are introduced.

4. Use exactly three learnable parameters with these bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

5. Define the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi)
where f(·) is your chosen fixed nonlinear transformation incorporating the additional term(s) as described.

6. Convert U into a choice probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(–U)).

7. Provide the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

8. Clearly indicate the predicted target variable in <target_variable> tags (set to “accept”).

The aim is to achieve improved predictive accuracy, a lower BIC, and enhanced parameter recovery by leveraging innovative fixed transformation terms while strictly using only three learnable parameters. Feel free to explore creative fixed non-linear modifiers beyond the most common functions to capture subtle behavioral dynamics.
