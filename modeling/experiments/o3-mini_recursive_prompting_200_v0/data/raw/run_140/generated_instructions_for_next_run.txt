For run 141, we want to further boost nonlinearity and flexibility while preserving the three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi). In this run, the negative branch of the adaptive function will be made more sensitive by increasing its exponent from 16 to 17. Also, extend the dynamic threshold T by summing the geometric series up to k = 45 terms (instead of 40) to capture even finer higher‐order effects. In the extra composite term, add two additional multiplicative factors: [1 + sigmoid(0.05×a)] and [1 + tanh(0.1×a)], and add an additional cosine factor cos(3.4×a) if it is not already present. Finally, modify the final exponent modulation by multiplying by an extra factor defined as [1 + 0.004×sin(2.8×a) + 0.001×cos(3.8×a) + 0.003×sin(3.4×a) + 0.002×cos(4.4×a)]. Retain exactly three learnable parameters with bounds: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. Encourage creative, out-of-the-box use of nonlinear functions (such as softplus, softsign, sigmoid, tanh, and cosine) in inventive combinations to further improve accuracy, reduce BIC, and enhance parameter recovery.

New Instructions for Run 141:
1. Compute the core sum “a” as the sum of fixed components F1 through F11 plus a small constant δ.
2. Define a_mod = 1.08 × a × [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)].
3. Sequentially modulate a_mod by multiplying by:
  • [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)]
  • [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)]
  • [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)]
  • [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))]
  • [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))]
Define the final product as z.
4. Compute w = (phi − 0.5) / phi.
  • For z ≥ 0, define the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z) as:
   1.002 × [ z^w × (ln(1+z))^(1−w) × softsign(z) ],
   where softsign(z) = z/(1 + |z|), and clip the result to [–30, 30].
  • For z < 0, define:
   f_adapt(z) = phi × [ softsign(z + Δ_shift) ]^17,
   with Δ_shift = 1×10⁻⁶.
5. Define the dynamic threshold T as the sum for k = 0 to 45 of (a^k × (1/2)^k) (i.e. a geometric series with ratio ½ up to 45 terms).
6. Define the extra composite term extra as:
  extra = { exp(–a/0.1) × [z/(1+|z|)] × [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1+a))] × [1 + 0.002 × cos(0.5×a)] × ([1+0.003×cos(0.3×a)]²) × ([1+0.004×cos(0.3×a)]²) × [1+0.0025×cos(0.7×a)] × [1 + tanh(0.05×a)] × [1 + sigmoid(0.01×a)] × [1 + 0.002×cos(3×a)] × [1 + 0.002×sin(2.5×a) + 0.001×cos(3.5×a) + 0.0015×sin(3×a)] × [1 + sigmoid(0.03×a)] × [1 + tanh(0.07×a)] × [1 + cos(3.1×a)] × [1 + sigmoid(0.04×a)] × [1 + tanh(0.08×a)] × [1 + cos(3.2×a)] × [1 + sigmoid(0.05×a)] × [1 + tanh(0.1×a)] × [1 + cos(3.4×a)] × [1 + sigmoid(0.05×a)] × [1 + tanh(0.1×a)] × [1 + sigmoid(0.05×a)] × [1 + tanh(0.1×a)] }^(0.9478 + 0.00018×ln(1+a)) multiplied by [1 + tanh(0.05×a)].
7. Define the final exponent modulation factor as:
  Exponent = [0.9478 + 0.00018×ln(1+a)] × [1 + 0.004×sin(2.8×a) + 0.001×cos(3.8×a) + 0.003×sin(3.4×a) + 0.002×cos(4.4×a)].
8. Define the final transformed signal as:
  f(x) = sign(z) × { [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra ]^(Exponent) }.
9. Compute latent utility U = beta + gamma × f(x) and then compute the acceptance probability:
  P(accept = 1) = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
10. Use exactly three learnable parameters with these bounds:
  beta ∈ [–10, 10],
  gamma ∈ [0, 10],
  phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].
Encourage creative and out-of-the-box use of functions such as softplus, softsign, sigmoid, tanh, and cosine in inventive combinations to further boost prediction accuracy, lower BIC, and improve parameter recovery.
