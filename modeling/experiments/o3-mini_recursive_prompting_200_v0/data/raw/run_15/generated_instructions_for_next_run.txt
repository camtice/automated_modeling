For run 16, we want to further innovate the fixed nonlinear transformation to capture even more subtle curvature in the fairness gap. In addition to the previous set of fixed terms, we now encourage incorporating an additional fixed term—such as a damped sine component—to introduce periodic nonlinearity that might capture oscillatory tendencies in decision-making. The candidate should use exactly three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, and phi) with the same bounds, and no additional learnable parameters. Emphasize that the model must compute the normalized offer percentage and fair share, derive the fairness gap F, scale it by phi, then apply a fixed transformation f(F/phi) that now includes an extra fixed term (e.g., 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) where x = F/phi) added to the previous transformation terms. The latent utility remains U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi) and is converted to a choice probability via the logistic function. Encourage out-of-the-box thinking while keeping the transformation fully specified with fixed coefficients.

For run 16 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making with the following requirements:

1. Compute the normalized offer percentage:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning,
  and the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

2. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer – N_share.

3. Scale the fairness gap by phi (learnable within [0.5, 1.5]) and let x = F / phi.

4. Apply a fixed nonlinear transformation f(·) to x that includes the following fixed terms:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × |x|)
  • 0.2 × atan(1.1 × |x|)
  • 0.1 × (1 – exp(–|x|))
  • 0.05 × (1 – exp(–2×|x|))
  • 0.03 × tanh(|x|)
  • An additional term: 0.02 × sin(0.5 × |x|)
Combine these terms with preservation of sign:
  f(x) = sign(x) * [|x|^(0.5) + ln(1 + 3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1 – exp(–|x|)) + 0.05×(1 – exp(–2×|x|)) + 0.03×tanh(|x|) + 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|)].

5. Use exactly three learnable parameters with the following bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

6. Define the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

7. Convert U into a choice probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(–U)).

8. Provide the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

9. Clearly indicate the predicted target variable in <target_variable> tags (set to “accept”).

The goal of these modifications is to increase predictive accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery by leveraging innovative fixed transformation terms that capture complex non-linearities. Feel free to explore additional fixed nonlinear modifiers, as long as no new learnable parameters are introduced.
