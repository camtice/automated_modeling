For run 158, the aim is to further improve accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery by increasing model flexibility in its nonlinear and oscillatory components. In this new version, explicitly increase the penalty for extreme negative proposals by raising the negative‐branch exponent in f_adapt from 44 to 46. In the extra composite term, add two new multiplicative factors: one equal to [1 + sigmoid(0.14 × a)] and another equal to [1 + tanh(0.35 × a)]. Also, include an additional oscillatory factor [1 + sin(4.2 × a)]. Additionally, nest one extra softplus layer so that softplus is applied seven times in succession (instead of six). Extend the dynamic threshold T by summing from k = 0 to 100 (if not already done) and consider allowing additional polynomial terms or even using a rational function form for T to boost flexibility. Finally, modify the final exponent modulation by multiplying it by an extra factor [1 + 0.009 × tanh(0.5 × a) + 0.004 × sin(3.5 × a) + 0.003 × cos(2.7 × a) + 0.002 × sin(4.0 × a)] and also multiply the extra composite term by a small Gaussian radial basis function exp(–((a – 1)²)/(2 × (0.25)²)). These suggestions aim to capture localized nonlinear effects and additional cyclic patterns that might improve model performance.

New Instructions for Run 158:

1. Compute the core sum a as the sum of fixed components F₁,…,F₁₁ plus a small constant δ.
2. Define a_mod = 1.08 × a × [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)].
3. Multiply a_mod sequentially by:
  • [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)]
  • [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)]
  • [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)]
  • [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))]
  • [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))]
 Define z as the resulting product.
4. Compute w = (phi − 0.5) / phi.
  • For z ≥ 0, set f_adapt(z) = clip[1.002 × (z^w × (ln(1+z))^(1−w) × softsign(z)), −30, 30], where softsign(x) = x/(1+|x|).
  • For z < 0, set f_adapt(z) = phi × [softsign(z + Δ_shift)]^(46), with Δ_shift = 1×10⁻⁶.
5. Define the dynamic threshold T as the sum from k = 0 to 100 of (a^k × (½)^k).
6. Define the extra composite term extra as the product of:
  • exp(–a/0.1)
  • [z/(1 + |z|)]
  • [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1+a))]
  • [1 + 0.002 × cos(0.5×a)]

Also, multiply extra by a Gaussian radial basis function exp(–((a–1)²)/(2×(0.25)²)). Then, nest one additional softplus layer so that softplus is applied seven times in succession to 0.865/(1+a). Finally, raise the entire product to the power [0.9478 + 0.00018 × ln(1+a)].
7. Define the final exponent modulation factor as:
  Exponent = [0.9478 + 0.00018 × ln(1+a)] × [1 + 0.008 × tanh(0.5×a) + 0.003 × sin(3.2×a) + 0.002 × cos(2.5×a) + 0.002 × sin(4.0×a)].
8. Compute the final transformed signal: f(x) = sign(z) × { [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra ]^(Exponent) }.
9. Compute latent utility U = beta + gamma × f(x) and then define P(accept = 1) = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
10. Use exactly three learnable parameters with finite bounds: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Remember to choose creative nonlinear interactions and oscillatory patterns beyond the obvious ones.
