For run 17, we want to push the boundaries further by enhancing the fixed nonlinear transformation applied to the scaled fairness gap. In addition to the fixed terms required previously, include an extra fixed term that introduces a cosine-based damping—this term could be 0.01×(1−cos(0.3×|x|)). This additional periodic term is designed to capture any residual oscillatory behavior in decision-making that the previous fixed terms might have missed. Maintain exactly three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, and phi) with the same bounds, and ensure that no additional learnable parameters are introduced. Be sure to clearly specify the complete mathematical model between <MODEL> and </MODEL>, provide the detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES>, and indicate the target variable in <target_variable> tags (which should be “accept”). Creativity is encouraged while remaining within these constraints.

For run 17 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making with the following requirements:

1. Compute the normalized offer percentage:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning,
  and the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

2. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer – N_share.

3. Scale the fairness gap by phi (learnable within [0.5, 1.5]) and let x = F / phi.

4. Apply a fixed nonlinear transformation f(·) to x that includes the following fixed terms:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × |x|)
  • 0.2 × atan(1.1 × |x|)
  • 0.1 × (1 – exp(–|x|))
  • 0.05 × (1 – exp(–2×|x|))
  • 0.03 × tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × |x|)
  • An additional term: 0.01 × (1 – cos(0.3 × |x|))
Combine these terms with preservation of sign as follows:
  f(x) = sign(x) × [|x|^(0.5) + ln(1 + 3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1 – exp(–|x|)) + 0.05×(1 – exp(–2×|x|)) + 0.03×tanh(|x|) + 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) + 0.01×(1 – cos(0.3×|x|))].

5. Use exactly three learnable parameters with the following bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

6. Define the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

7. Convert U into a choice probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(–U)).

8. Provide the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

9. Clearly indicate the predicted target variable in <target_variable> tags (set to “accept”).

The goal of these modifications is to enhance predictive accuracy, lower BIC, and improve parameter recovery by capturing even more subtle nonlinearities in decision-making. Creativity and out-of-the-box thinking are encouraged as long as you adhere to the specified constraints.
