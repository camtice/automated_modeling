For run 18, we want to refine the fixed nonlinear transformation further to capture even more subtle nonlinearities without adding any new learnable parameters. In addition to the eight fixed terms specified previously—including the cosine-based damping term—we now want to include an extra fixed term, 0.005×exp(–|x|), to gently adjust the weighting for small absolute values of x. This extra term is designed to provide additional smoothing around zero and help promote improved accuracy, lower BIC, and enhanced parameter recovery. The sequence of computations (normalized offer, fair share, fairness gap F, scaling x = F/phi, transformation f(x), latent utility U and logistic conversion to p_accept) remains the same. Remember to maintain exactly three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, and phi) with the specified bounds. Encouraging creative, out-of-the-box ideas within these fixed constraints may lead to further improvements. Ensure that your formal specification is provided between <MODEL> and </MODEL>, with detailed JSON variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES>, and that the target variable is clearly identified inside <target_variable> tags as “accept”.

For run 18 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making with the following requirements:

1. Compute the normalized offer percentage:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning,
  and the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

2. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer – N_share.

3. Scale the fairness gap by phi (learnable within [0.5, 1.5]) and let x = F / phi.

4. Apply a fixed nonlinear transformation f(·) to x that incorporates the following fixed terms:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × |x|)
  • 0.2 × atan(1.1 × |x|)
  • 0.1 × (1 – exp(–|x|))
  • 0.05 × (1 – exp(–2×|x|))
  • 0.03 × tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × |x|)
  • 0.01 × (1 – cos(0.3 × |x|))
  • An additional fixed term: 0.005 × exp(–|x|)
Combine these terms while preserving the sign as follows:
  f(x) = sign(x) × [|x|^(0.5) + ln(1 + 3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1 – exp(–|x|)) + 0.05×(1 – exp(–2×|x|)) + 0.03×tanh(|x|) + 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) + 0.01×(1 – cos(0.3×|x|)) + 0.005×exp(–|x|)].

5. Use exactly three learnable parameters with the following bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

6. Define the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

7. Convert U into a choice probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(–U)).

8. Provide the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

9. Clearly indicate the predicted target variable in <target_variable> tags (set to “accept”).

The goal of these modifications is to further enhance predictive accuracy, lower the BIC, and boost the quality of parameter recovery by capturing even more subtle nonlinearities in decision-making. Creativity in the design of the fixed transformation is encouraged, as long as you adhere to the constraints above.
