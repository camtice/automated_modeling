For the new run, I'd like to encourage the model designer to introduce more flexible, nested nonlinear corrections. In particular, enhance the adaptive transformation for small and negative values by including a local quadratic (or even higher‐order) correction for z near 0. Also, experiment with adding additional nested softplus or softsign chains in the extra modulation term to “smooth” extreme values and reduce variability. The dynamic threshold T can be made somewhat more expressive (for example, using a Padé approximant of a higher order) to better capture the scale of a. Finally, adapt the exponent modulator by including additional oscillatory terms (e.g., sine/cosine functions in a) to refine the curvature and thereby improve accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery. Use exactly the same strict bounds on learnable parameters (beta in [–10, 10], gamma in [0, 10], and phi in [0.5, 1.5]). Encourage out‐of‐the‑box ideas, such as exploring alternative penalty functions for the negative branch, and adding mild additive corrections when |z| is very small.

1. Compute the core sum:                 a = Σ[i=1 to 11] Fᵢ + δ.
2. Transform the core sum with a sinusoidal modulation: a_mod = 1.08 × a × [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)].
3. Compute the composite signal z as the product: z = a_mod × [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)] × [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)] × [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)] × [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))] × [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))].
4. Define the weight: w = (phi – 0.5) / phi.
5. For the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z), use a piecewise function:
 • For z ≥ ϵ (e.g. 0.0001): use a Padé‐like blend augmented with a local quadratic correction (e.g. add k₁⋅z²) so that f_adapt(z) = z + k₁⋅z² + ln(1+z) + k₂⋅[z/(1+z)].
 • For z below ϵ, use a steep saturation function such as f_adapt(z) = – max(0, –z – Δₛ)^p.
Feel free to tune the constants k₁, k₂, Δₛ, and p.
6. Define a dynamic threshold T using a higher‐order Padé approximation, for example T = Σ[k=0 to K] (a^k × (1/2)^k) with K large (suggest K between 30 and 150) to capture the scale of a.
7. Define an extra modulation term extra that adds gentle oscillatory corrections. Consider incorporating nested softplus chains (e.g. softplus(softplus(...))) and/or additional sine/cosine terms to improve smoothing.
8. Define the final exponent modulator as: Exponent = [0.9478 + 0.00018 × ln(1+a)] × [1 + α₁ × sin(a) + α₂ × cos(2a) + …], where you may add extra oscillatory terms to capture curvature.
9. Compute the overall transformed signal: f(x) = sign(z) × { [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra × w ]^(Exponent) }.
10. Set the latent utility U = beta + gamma × f(x) and compute the acceptance probability as: P(accept) = 1 / [1 + exp(–U)].
11. Use exactly three learnable parameters with strict bounds:  
  beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].
12. Consider experimenting with additional local corrections for small |z| (e.g. adding a term proportional to z² when |z| is below a small threshold) and incorporating extra nested nonlinearities (such as an extra softplus chain) in the extra modulation term.

<SUMMARY>
This model computes a core sum from fixed features, then applies sequential sinusoidal and cosine modulations. It uses an adaptive transformation—blending a Padé‐like function with a local quadratic correction for small values and a steep penalty for negative values—followed by a dynamic threshold and an extra modulation term enriched with nested nonlinearities. The transformed signal is raised to a modulated exponent and linearly combined with learnable parameters beta and gamma to yield latent utility, which is then mapped by a logistic function to predict acceptance.
