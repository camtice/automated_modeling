For run 19, we aim to push the fixed nonlinear transformation to capture even more subtle nonlinearities while still using exactly three learnable parameters. In addition to the fixed component terms from run 18, we will now compress the overall magnitude of the transformation by raising the sum of the fixed terms to a constant fixed exponent (0.9). This modification is intended to dampen the influence of extreme values subtly, enhancing accuracy, improving BIC, and boosting parameter recovery. All other parts of the model (normalized offer, fair share, fairness gap, scaling by phi, latent utility computation, and logistic conversion) remain unchanged. The learnable parameters remain as beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. Creativity in the model configuration is encouraged, so consider the fixed exponent as a tool to adapt sensitivity without increasing the number of free parameters.

For run 19 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making with the following requirements:

1. Compute the normalized offer percentage:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning,
  and the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

2. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer – N_share.

3. Scale the fairness gap by phi (learnable within [0.5, 1.5]) and let x = F / phi.

4. Apply a fixed nonlinear transformation f(·) to x that incorporates the following fixed terms:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × |x|)
  • 0.2 × atan(1.1 × |x|)
  • 0.1 × (1 – exp(–|x|))
  • 0.05 × (1 – exp(–2×|x|))
  • 0.03 × tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × |x|)
  • 0.01 × (1 – cos(0.3 × |x|))
  • An additional fixed term: 0.005 × exp(–|x|)
Combine these terms by summing them, then compress the overall magnitude by raising the sum to the fixed exponent 0.9 while preserving the original sign. Formally, define:
  f(x) = sign(x) × ([|x|^(0.5) + ln(1 + 3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1 – exp(–|x|)) + 0.05×(1 – exp(–2×|x|)) + 0.03×tanh(|x|) + 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) + 0.01×(1 – cos(0.3×|x|)) + 0.005×exp(–|x|))]^(0.9)).

5. Use exactly three learnable parameters with the following bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

6. Define the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

7. Convert U into a choice probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(–U)).

8. Provide the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

9. Clearly indicate the predicted target variable in <target_variable> tags (set to “accept”).

This modification, by incorporating a fixed compression exponent (0.9) into the transformation function, is designed to enhance predictive accuracy, lower the BIC, and improve parameter recovery by reducing the impact of extreme fairness gap values.
