For run 20, we want to encourage even more creative thinking while still keeping to exactly three learnable parameters. In this version, we adjust the fixed nonlinear transformation by slightly changing the compression exponent from 0.9 to 0.92 to better balance sensitivity to moderate fairness gaps versus extreme values. In addition, we introduce a tiny additive constant inside the powered term to enhance numerical stability and possibly improve parameter recovery. We explicitly encourage the exploration of unconventional modifications to the fixed transformation while maintaining the same basic structure: normalized offer, normalized fair share, fairness gap, scaling by phi, and then applying the transformation before computing the latent utility. The learnable parameters remain beta, gamma, and phi with the same bounds. This slight update is expected to yield improved accuracy, lower BIC, and better parameter recovery.

For run 20 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making with the following requirements:

1. Compute the normalized offer percentage:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning,
  and the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

2. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer – N_share.

3. Scale the fairness gap by phi (learnable within [0.5, 1.5]) and let x = F / phi.

4. Apply a fixed nonlinear transformation f(·) to x that incorporates the following fixed terms:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × |x|)
  • 0.2 × atan(1.1 × |x|)
  • 0.1 × (1 – exp(–|x|))
  • 0.05 × (1 – exp(–2×|x|))
  • 0.03 × tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × |x|)
  • 0.01 × (1 – cos(0.3 × |x|))
  • An additional fixed term: 0.005 × exp(–|x|)
Sum these terms, add a tiny constant (e.g. 1e-6) for numerical stability, then compress the overall magnitude by raising the sum to the fixed exponent 0.92 while preserving the original sign. Formally, define:
  f(x) = sign(x) × ([|x|^(0.5) + ln(1 + 3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1 – exp(–|x|)) + 0.05×(1 – exp(–2×|x|)) + 0.03×tanh(|x|) + 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) + 0.01×(1 – cos(0.3×|x|)) + 0.005×exp(–|x|) + 1e-6])^(0.92).

5. Use exactly three learnable parameters with the following bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

6. Define the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

7. Convert U into a choice probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(–U)).

8. Provide the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

9. Clearly indicate the predicted target variable in <target_variable> tags (set to “accept”).

Remember: while keeping the overall structure intact, feel free to explore and document unconventional aspects within the fixed nonlinear transformation. The slight changes (exponent 0.92 and additive constant for stability) are intended to further improve predictive accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery.
