Based on the previous run, we want to lower the BIC and increase accuracy and improve parameter recovery. We could advise trying smoother alternatives for the negative branch (for example, using a nested softplus chain with moderate exponent instead of huge exponents) and to experiment with updating the dynamic threshold T (e.g., using a Padé approximant with tighter bounds) and give flexibility in tuning the extra term (including a Gaussian radial basis term that can capture nonlinearity near a = 1). We could also encourage the addition of oscillatory modulation directly in the exponent modulator. We want to encourage innovation, so suggest exploring different functions for f_adapt for both branches. Emphasize the need to define finite parameter bounds for beta, gamma, and phi.

1. Compute the core sum:  a = Σ[i=1 to 11] Fᵢ + δ.
2. Apply sinusoidal scaling: a_mod = 1.08 × a × [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)].
3. Compute the composite signal by sequential multiplicative modulations: z = a_mod × [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)] × [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)] × [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)] × [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))] × [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))].
4. Define the weight: w = (phi – 0.5) / phi.
5. For f_adapt(z), use a piecewise function that for z ≥ ε (set ε = 0.0001) uses a softer rational transformation augmented by a small quadratic correction and softsign smoothing; for z < ε, use a nested softplus chain with a moderate exponent (target exponent between 2 and 6) instead of very high powers.
6. Revise the dynamic threshold T. Instead of a simple power series sum from k=0 to K, consider using an alternate Padé approximant or a rational function that is less sensitive to extreme values. Allow K to be adjustable in the range 30–50.
7. For the extra term, allow an additional Gaussian radial basis function, for instance, multiplying extra by exp(–((a – 1)²)/(2σ²)) with σ around 0.25, to better capture local nonlinearities near a = 1. Also encourage stacking a few (2-4) nested softplus (or softsign) layers.
8. In the exponent modulator, include additional oscillatory components (e.g., include a sin() or tanh() term) to compress extreme values more smoothly.
9. Add an optional mild local correction term (such as a small multiple of z² when |z| is very small) so that near zero, the model is sensitive.
10. Ensure exactly three learnable parameters with strict finite bounds: beta must lie in [–10, 10], gamma in [0, 10], and phi in [0.5, 1.5].
11. Encourage out-of-the-box experimentation for the negative branch of f_adapt—try using a nested softplus chain with an exponent in the range of 2–6 instead of a very high power function.
12. Consider experimenting with a slight increase in the flexibility of the exponent modulator by incorporating additional oscillatory terms (for example, including both sin(2a) and cos(2a)), to allow a more fine‐tuned compression of the transformed signal.

<SUMMARY>
The model computes a core sum from 11 fixed features and applies sequential sinusoidal and cosine modulations to yield an intermediate signal. A piecewise adaptive transformation—with a softened rational (ln-based) plus local quadratic correction for nonnegative values and a nested softplus chain with moderate exponent for negatives—smoothly transforms the intermediate signal. This is further modulated by a dynamic threshold and an extra composite term that incorporates nested nonlinearities (including a Gaussian radial basis). The resulting signal is raised to an adaptive exponent modulated by additional oscillatory components, then linearly combined with base (beta) and scaling (gamma) parameters to yield latent utility, which is mapped via a logistic function for acceptance probability prediction. The learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi) are strictly bounded.
