1. Compute the core sum: a = Σ[i=1 to 11] Fᵢ + δ.
2. Scale a with a sinusoidal factor: a_mod = 1.08 × a × [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)].
3. Build a composite signal by sequential, multiplicative modulations:
  z = a_mod × [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)] × [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)] × [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)] × [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))] × [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))].
4. Define the weight: w = (phi – 0.5) / phi.
5. Use a piecewise adaptive transformation f_adapt(z) as follows:
  • For nonnegative z (z ≥ 0.0001), apply a softened rational transformation that combines ln(1+z) with a small quadratic correction and softsign smoothing (e.g., f_adapt = ln(1+z) + 0.05·z²/(1+z) + tanh(z) + 0.001·z²). 
  • For very small or negative z (z < 0.0001), use a nested softplus chain with a moderate exponent (preferably between 2 and 6) so as to avoid extreme sensitivity.
6. Replace a simple power series for the dynamic threshold T with a moderately long Padé approximant (using k in the range of 30 to 50) to stabilize T.
7. In the extra composite term, incorporate a Gaussian radial basis function (e.g. exp(–((a–1)²)/(2·(0.25)²))) and optionally stack 2–4 nested softplus (or softsign) layers to capture local nonlinearities.
8. In the exponent modulator, include additional oscillatory terms such as sin(2a) and cos(2a) (and possibly sin(3a) or cos(3a)) to smooth the compression of extreme values.
9. Optionally introduce a small local correction (such as 0.001·z² added when |z| is very small) to enhance sensitivity near zero.
10. Constrain the three learnable parameters strictly:
  beta ∈ [–10, 10],
  gamma ∈ [0, 10],
  phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].
11. Encourage exploration in the negative branch of f_adapt by adjusting the number of nested softplus layers or by altering the exponent (preferably between 2 and 6) so that the model is less harsh on small negative signals.

<SUMMARY>
The model computes a core sum from 11 fixed features and scales it sinusoidally before applying sequential multiplicative modulations to form an intermediate signal. A piecewise adaptive function then softly transforms this signal—using a rational (ln‐based) plus quadratic correction for nonnegative values and a nested softplus chain for negative values. A dynamic threshold is computed via a Padé approximant (with 30–50 terms) and an extra composite term, enriched with a Gaussian radial basis and additional oscillatory modifiers, further refines the signal. Finally, the result is raised to an adaptive exponent modulated by sin and cos terms and linearly combined with three bounded learnable parameters (beta in [–10,10], gamma in [0,10], and phi in [0.5,1.5]). This design is intended to improve accuracy, reduce BIC, and enhance parameter recovery.
