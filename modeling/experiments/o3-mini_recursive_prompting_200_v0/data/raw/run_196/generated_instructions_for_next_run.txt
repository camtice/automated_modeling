1. Compute the core sum: a = Σ[i=1 to 11] Fᵢ + δ.
2. Scale a with a sinusoidal factor: a_mod = 1.08 · a · (1 + 0.012 · sin(a + 0.045)).
3. Build a composite signal by sequential, multiplicative modulations:
  z = a_mod · [1 + 0.008 · cos(a + 0.065)] · [1 + 0.005 · sin(a + 0.115)] · [1 + 0.004 · cos(a + 0.085)] · [1 + 0.006 · (sin(a + 0.035) · cos(a + 0.055))] · [1 + 0.003 · (sin(a + 0.03) · cos(a + 0.05))].
4. Define the weight: w = (φ – 0.5) / φ.
5. Define a piecewise adaptive transformation f_adapt(z):
  • For z ≥ ε (choose ε around 1e–3), use a softened rational transformation that blends the logarithm and a small quadratic term (e.g., f_adapt = ln(1+z) + k₁·z²/(1+z) + tanh(z)) with softsign smoothing.
  • For z < ε, use a smooth, nested softplus (or softsign) formulation with a moderate exponent (try an exponent between 2 and 4) to avoid over-penalizing small negative signals.
6. Compute a dynamic threshold T using a Padé approximant with k in the range 30–50.
7. In the extra composite term, incorporate a Gaussian radial basis component (e.g., exp(–((a – 1)²)/(2·(0.25)²))) and stack a few nested softplus (or softsign) functions (2–4 levels) so as to smooth localized nonlinearities.
8. For the exponent modulator, add additional oscillatory corrections (for example, include sin(2a), cos(2a), or even sin(3a)/cos(3a)) to gently compress extreme values.
9. Optionally add a small local correction term (for example, 0.001·z² for |z| below a small threshold) to improve sensitivity near zero.
10. Constrain the three learnable parameters with strict finite bounds:
  • beta ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma ∈ [0, 10],
  • φ ∈ [0.5, 1.5].
11. Encourage exploration in the negative branch by moderating the negative transformation (e.g., using a nested softplus with an exponent set between 2 and 4 instead of overly high values) to improve parameter recovery.
12. Feel free to consider alternative nonlinear functions (or combinations thereof) that can provide smoother behavior and reduce over‐penalization in extreme regions while still capturing diminishing sensitivity.

Remember, the goal is to improve overall accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery. Experiment with alternative formulations within these guidelines to achieve better performance.
