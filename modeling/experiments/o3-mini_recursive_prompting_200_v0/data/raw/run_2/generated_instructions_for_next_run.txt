For run 3, we want to push creativity further by encouraging a model that not only transforms the fairness difference (which is the discrepancy between the offered and expected share) non-linearly, but also normalizes this value to account for between-trial variability. Consider introducing a scaling parameter that is applied to a normalized version of the fairness gap, for example by dividing by a measure of central tendency (or even an empirical constant) to reduce parameter covariance. Additionally, think about applying a transformation (such as a square-root, logarithm, or other appropriate non-linearity) to the normalized fairness difference. All new learnable parameters must have clearly specified and tight finite bounds to minimize overparameterization and interdependence. Emphasize that these modifications are motivated by psychological theories of fairness perception and decision-making, where individuals might respond relative to a normalized fairness signal rather than its absolute value. Maintain parsimony by adding at most one extra scaling parameter beyond the baseline bias and sensitivity parameters and ensure that every parameter is explicitly connected to observable trial variables.

For run 3 of 200, please follow these updated instructions:

1. Clearly describe the psychological rationale behind the model: responder decision-making might depend on an internally normalized fairness difference. This normalization (or rescaling) helps capture participants’ sensitivity to relative deviations rather than absolute differences. Incorporate a non-linear transformation of the normalized fairness difference (e.g., square-root or logarithmic) to mirror empirically observed diminishing returns in sensitivity to fairness deviations.

2. Propose a mathematical model that predicts latent utility using three learnable parameters: a baseline bias, a sensitivity to the fairness signal, and an additional scaling parameter that normalizes or transforms the fairness difference before applying the non-linear transformation. Justify the use of this extra parameter as a way to decouple the bias from the perceived fairness gap and to address potential covariance between parameters.

3. Specify clear finite bounds for all learnable parameters via generous yet well-defined uniform priors (for example, bias ∈ [–10, 10], sensitivity ∈ [0, 10], and the scaling parameter ∈ [0.1, 2]). Explicitly motivate the choice of these bounds with respect to the psychological mechanism being modeled and potential parameter interdependence.

4. Ensure the model directly predicts a latent utility derived from the transformed, normalized fairness difference. Then, convert this utility into a probability via a logistic function. The fairness difference must be computed using the observable variables: split_self, combined_earning, token_self, and token_opp. Your model may incorporate any simple transformation (e.g., normalizing by a constant or an empirical measure) that reduces the covariance between the learnable parameters.

5. Write out your formal mathematical model between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and provide variable descriptions in a JSON format between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags. The model must only predict responder choices using the dataset variables provided.

6. Avoid unnecessary complexity by including at most one additional learnable parameter beyond the bias and sensitivity parameters, and ensure that all learning parameters have explicit finite bounds.

Remember to be creative and out-of-the-box while grounding any modifications in clearly defined psychological mechanisms of fairness processing and decision-making.
