For run 22, we want to build on our previous approach by experimenting with even more unconventional tweaks that might improve accuracy, lower BIC, and deliver better parameter recovery. In this run, encourage incorporating an additional multiplicative factor applied to the entire transformation, and consider adjusting the compression exponent slightly (for example, using 0.93 instead of 0.94) to explore different sensitivity profiles. Also, invite the inclusion of an optional extra trigonometric modulation term (e.g., an extra cosine modulation) within the nonlinear transformation to capture subtle oscillatory behavior. Keep the basic structure intact: compute normalized offer (N_offer) and normalized fair share (N_share), derive the fairness gap F, scale it by phi with x = F/phi, then apply the fixed nonlinear transformation. The transformation should sum the fixed terms (|x|^(0.5), ln(1+3.4×|x|), 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|), 0.1×(1–exp(–|x|)), 0.05×(1–exp(–2×|x|)), 0.03×tanh(|x|), 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|), 0.01×(1–cos(0.3×|x|)), 0.005×exp(–|x|)) and optionally include 0.005×cos(2.0×|x|), then multiply the entire sum by a fixed constant (e.g., 1.05) before adding a tiny constant for stability. Finally, compress the sum by raising it to a new fixed exponent (e.g., 0.93) while preserving the sign. Define the latent utility U = beta + gamma × f(x) and map it to p_accept via the logistic function. Ensure the learnable parameters beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. Be creative and explicit in your mathematical specification.

For run 22 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making with the following requirements:

1. Compute the normalized offer percentage:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning,
  and the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

2. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer – N_share.

3. Scale the fairness gap by phi (learnable within [0.5, 1.5]) to obtain:
  x = F / phi.

4. Apply a fixed nonlinear transformation f(·) to x that incorporates the following fixed terms:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × |x|)
  • 0.2 × atan(1.1 × |x|)
  • 0.1 × (1 – exp(–|x|))
  • 0.05 × (1 – exp(–2×|x|))
  • 0.03 × tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × |x|)
  • 0.01 × (1 – cos(0.3 × |x|))
  • 0.005 × exp(–|x|)
Optionally, include an extra fixed cosine modulation term such as 0.005 × cos(2.0 × |x|) in the sum.
Then, multiply the entire summed value by a fixed factor of 1.05, add a tiny constant (e.g., 1e-6) for numerical stability, and compress the overall magnitude by raising the result to a fixed compression exponent—now set to 0.93 to explore a modified sensitivity profile—while preserving the sign. Formally, define:
  f(x) = sign(x) × (1.05 × ([|x|^(0.5) + ln(1 + 3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1 – exp(–|x|)) + 0.05×(1 – exp(–2×|x|)) + 0.03×tanh(|x|) + 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) + 0.01×(1 – cos(0.3×|x|)) + 0.005×exp(–|x|) [ + 0.005×cos(2.0×|x|) ] + 1e-6))^(0.93).

5. Use exactly three learnable parameters with these bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

6. Define the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

7. Convert U into a choice probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(–U)).

8. Provide the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

9. Clearly indicate the predicted target variable in <target_variable> tags (set to “accept”).

Keep the overall structure intact while allowing these unconventional tweaks to encourage out-of-the-box thinking that may further improve accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery.
