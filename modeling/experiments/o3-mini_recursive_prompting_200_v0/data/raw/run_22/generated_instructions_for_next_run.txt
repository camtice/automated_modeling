For run 23, refine the model by slightly adjusting the fixed transformation within the nonlinear function. Increase the fixed multiplicative factor from 1.05 to 1.08 and decrease the compression exponent from 0.93 to 0.92. Also, encourage exploring an additional complementary trigonometric term—for example, 0.005×sin(2.0×|x|) added to the summation—to capture subtle oscillatory behavior. Retain the overall structure: compute normalized offer (N_offer) and normalized fair share (N_share), derive the fairness gap F, scale it via x = F/phi, then transform x with the fixed nonlinear function that sums the following fixed terms: |x|^(0.5), ln(1 + 3.4×|x|), 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|), 0.1×(1 – exp(–|x|)), 0.05×(1 – exp(–2×|x|)), 0.03×tanh(|x|), 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|), 0.01×(1 – cos(0.3×|x|)), and 0.005×exp(–|x|). Optionally include both the extra cosine modulation term (0.005×cos(2.0×|x|)) and/or the extra sine modulation term (0.005×sin(2.0×|x|)) within the sum. Multiply the entire sum by the new fixed constant (1.08), add a tiny constant (e.g., 1e-6) for numerical stability, and then compress the overall magnitude by raising the result to the fixed exponent (0.92), while preserving the sign. Define the latent utility U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi) and map it via the logistic function to obtain p_accept. Keep the same three learnable parameters with these bounds: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. This modified instruction aims to encourage out-of-the-box nonstandard tweaks that may further lower BIC, improve parameter recovery, and boost accuracy.

For run 23 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making with the following requirements:

1. Compute the normalized offer percentage:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning,
  and the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

2. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer – N_share.

3. Scale the fairness gap by phi (with phi learnable within [0.5, 1.5]) to obtain:
  x = F / phi.

4. Apply a fixed nonlinear transformation f(·) to x that incorporates the following fixed terms:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × |x|)
  • 0.2 × atan(1.1 × |x|)
  • 0.1 × (1 – exp(–|x|))
  • 0.05 × (1 – exp(–2×|x|))
  • 0.03 × tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × |x|)
  • 0.01 × (1 – cos(0.3 × |x|))
  • 0.005 × exp(–|x|)
Optionally, include the extra fixed cosine modulation term 0.005×cos(2.0×|x|) and/or the extra sine modulation term 0.005×sin(2.0×|x|) within the sum.

Then, multiply the entire summed value by a fixed constant of 1.08, add a tiny constant (e.g., 1e-6) for numerical stability, and compress the overall magnitude by raising the result to a fixed compression exponent of 0.92, while preserving the sign. Formally, define:
  f(x) = sign(x) × (1.08 × ([|x|^(0.5) + ln(1 + 3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1 – exp(–|x|)) + 0.05×(1 – exp(–2×|x|)) + 0.03×tanh(|x|) + 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) + 0.01×(1 – cos(0.3×|x|)) + 0.005×exp(–|x|) [ + 0.005×cos(2.0×|x|) [ + 0.005×sin(2.0×|x|) ] ] + 1e-6))^(0.92).

5. Use exactly three learnable parameters with the following bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

6. Define the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

7. Convert U into a choice probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(–U)).

8. Provide the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

9. Clearly indicate the predicted target variable in <target_variable> tags (set to “accept”).

Encourage creative and out-of-the-box thinking in your formal model specification while maintaining the overall structure.
