In run 24, focus on tightening model performance by refining the nonlinear transformation further. Introduce an additional optional modulation term—specifically, a 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|) term—to capture more subtle oscillatory behavior. Maintain the overall structure of computing N_offer and N_share to form F and then scaling it via x = F/phi. Preserve the existing fixed transformation components while allowing room for creative, out-of-the-box tweaks. We continue using exactly three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, and phi) with bounds beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. Emphasize that while the main structure stays intact, the transformation function is open to additional or modified fixed terms to potentially reduce BIC, improve parameter recovery, and boost accuracy. Encourage the incorporation of slight variations to the fixed function if it aids in fitting the data better.

For run 24 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making with the following requirements:

1. Compute the normalized offer percentage:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning,
  and the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

2. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer – N_share.

3. Scale the fairness gap using phi (with phi learnable within [0.5, 1.5]) to obtain:
  x = F / phi.

4. Apply a fixed nonlinear transformation f(·) to x that incorporates the following fixed terms:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × |x|)
  • 0.2 × atan(1.1 × |x|)
  • 0.1 × (1 – exp(–|x|))
  • 0.05 × (1 – exp(–2 × |x|))
  • 0.03 × tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × |x|)
  • 0.01 × (1 – cos(0.3 × |x|))
  • 0.005 × exp(–|x|)
Optionally, include the extra fixed modulation terms: 0.005×cos(2.0×|x|), 0.005×sin(2.0×|x|), and/or the new additional term 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|).

Then, multiply the entire summed value by a fixed constant of 1.08, add a tiny constant (e.g., 1e-6) for numerical stability, and compress the overall magnitude by raising the resulting sum to a fixed compression exponent of 0.92, all while preserving the sign. Formally, define:
  f(x) = sign(x) × (1.08 × ([|x|^(0.5) + ln(1 + 3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1 – exp(–|x|)) + 0.05×(1 – exp(–2×|x|)) + 0.03×tanh(|x|) + 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) + 0.01×(1 – cos(0.3×|x|)) + 0.005×exp(–|x|) [ + 0.005×cos(2.0×|x|) [ + 0.005×sin(2.0×|x|) ] + [ + 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|) ] ] + 1e-6))^(0.92).

5. Use exactly three learnable parameters with the specified bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling factor) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

6. Define the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

7. Convert U into a choice probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(–U)).

8. Provide the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

9. Clearly indicate the predicted target variable in <target_variable> tags (set to “accept”).

Ensure that your final specification is concise, mathematically rigorous, and open to creative modifications that may improve overall model performance.
