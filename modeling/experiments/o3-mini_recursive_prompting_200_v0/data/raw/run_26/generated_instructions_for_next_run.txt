For run 27, we want to build on the established framework while encouraging creative adaptations. We will instruct the model designer to retain the overall structure (normalized offer, fairness gap, scaling, fixed nonlinear transformation, latent utility and logistic conversion) but suggest modifications that allow adaptive weighting on some of the oscillatory components. We can encourage trying an additional modulation term (for example, sin(2.2×|x|)) and also allow slight adjustments to the overall multiplier (e.g. testing a multiplier around 1.05–1.10) and compression exponent (around 0.90–0.94). Stress that only three learnable parameters are allowed (beta, gamma, phi with the same bounds). We want to ensure improved BIC, parameter recovery, and prediction accuracy even if that means experimenting with additional subtle nonlinear contributions and adaptive weights.

For run 27 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making that satisfies the following requirements:

1. Compute the normalized offer percentage:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning,
  and the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

2. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer − N_share.

3. Scale the fairness gap with phi (with phi learnable within [0.5, 1.5]) to obtain:
  x = F / phi.

4. Apply a fixed nonlinear transformation f(·) to x which must include the following fixed terms:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × |x|)
  • 0.2 × atan(1.1 × |x|)
  • 0.1 × (1 – exp(–|x|))
  • 0.05 × (1 – exp(–2 × |x|))
  • 0.03 × tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × |x|)
  • 0.01 × (1 – cos(0.3 × |x|))
  • 0.005 × exp(–|x|)
Additionally, explore adaptive weighting by possibly assigning different fixed multipliers to the oscillatory components (such as sin and cos terms) and consider including an extra modulation term (for example, 0.005 × sin(2.2 × |x|) or 0.002 × cos(3.0 × |x|)) to capture subtle oscillatory effects. You may also experiment with a modest adjustment to the constant multiplier (suggest around 1.05 to 1.10) and a slight tweak to the compression exponent (in the range 0.90 to 0.94). The transformation should be defined formally as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × ( C × (|x|^(0.5) + ln(1 + 3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1 – exp(–|x|)) + 0.05×(1 – exp(–2×|x|)) + 0.03×tanh(|x|) + 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) + 0.01×(1 – cos(0.3×|x|)) + 0.005×exp(–|x|) [ + optional modulation terms ]) + 1e-6)^(E),
where C is a constant (suggest testing values near 1.08) and E is the compression exponent (suggest near 0.92). Feel free to adjust these slightly to optimize model performance.

5. Use exactly three learnable parameters with the following bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling factor) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

6. Compute the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

7. Derive the probability of acceptance using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(–U)).

8. Provide the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags and supply detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

9. Clearly designate the predicted target variable with <target_variable> tags (set to “accept”).

Encourage exploring these subtle nonlinear modulations and adaptive weighting strategies as a means to further lower BIC, improve parameter recovery, and boost prediction accuracy. Think outside the box and experiment with additional small modulation terms if they help capture nuanced aspects of the data.
