For run 29, our goal is to push the model designer to explore a broader and more flexible nonlinear transformation while adhering strictly to a three-parameter scheme. We want the transformation to include all the fixed nonlinear components as before, but now with explicit encouragement to experiment with additional optional modulation terms (for example, extra sin or cos components) and adaptive modifications such as slightly different constant multipliers and compression exponents. Emphasize that only beta, gamma, and phi remain learnable with their original bounds. Encourage creativity in combining fixed components, considering hybrid or multiplicative interactions to smooth out the transformation’s curvature and bring improvements in accuracy, BIC, and parameter recovery.

For run 29 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision‐making that meets the following requirements:

1. Compute the normalized offer percentage:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning,
  and the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

2. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer − N_share.

3. Scale the fairness gap with phi (with phi learnable within [0.5, 1.5]) to obtain:
  x = F / phi.

4. Apply a fixed nonlinear transformation f(·) to x that must include these fixed terms:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × |x|)
  • 0.2 × atan(1.1 × |x|)
  • 0.1 × (1 − exp(–|x|))
  • 0.05 × (1 − exp(–2 × |x|))
  • 0.03 × tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × |x|)
  • 0.01 × (1 − cos(0.3 × |x|))
  • 0.005 × exp(–|x|)

 Additionally, you are encouraged to explore adaptive weighting on the oscillatory components by:
  – Assigning possibly distinct fixed multipliers to terms like sin(0.5×|x|) and (1 − cos(0.3×|x|)).
  – Optionally including an extra modulation term (for example, 0.005 × sin(2.2 × |x|) or 0.002 × cos(3.0 × |x|)) to capture subtle oscillatory effects.
  – Experimenting with a modest adjustment to the constant multiplier (suggest a value between 1.05 and 1.10) and tweaking the compression exponent (suggest a value between 0.90 and 0.94).

 Formally, define the transformation as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × ( C × (|x|^(0.5) + ln(1 + 3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1 − exp(–|x|)) + 0.05×(1 − exp(–2×|x|)) + 0.03×tanh(|x|) + 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) + 0.01×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|)) + 0.005×exp(–|x|) [ + optionally, extra modulation terms ] ) + 1e-6 )^(E),
 where C is a fixed constant (suggest testing a value near 1.08) and E is the fixed compression exponent (suggest near 0.92). Feel free to be creative with the optional terms and their fixed multipliers as long as no additional learnable parameters are introduced.

5. Use exactly three learnable parameters with the following bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling factor) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

6. Compute the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

7. Derive the acceptance probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(–U)).

8. Provide the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags and supply detailed JSON‐formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

9. Clearly designate the predicted target variable using <target_variable> tags (set to “accept”).

Encourage experimentation with novel combinations and adaptive weighting strategies within the fixed transformation. Think outside the box to capture nuanced aspects of the data while maintaining the integrity of the three learnable parameters.

Good luck!
