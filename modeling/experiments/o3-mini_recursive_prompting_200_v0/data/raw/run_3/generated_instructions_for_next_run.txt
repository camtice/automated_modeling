For run 4, we want to push the envelope by encouraging models that use normalized fairness measures based on ratios rather than absolute differences, which can help decouple parameters and improve recovery. In addition to the non-linear transformation, consider operating on percentages to mitigate scaling issues. Also, encourage use of alternative transformations (e.g., logarithm or power transforms) that can capture diminishing sensitivity, provided the transformation is well-motivated and maintains interpretability. Adjust the finite bounds for the scaling parameter to a tighter range and explain the rationale behind using these bounds.

For run 4 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making that:
1. Computes the fairness difference using normalized percentages rather than monetary amounts. Specifically, derive the normalized offer as (split_self / combined_earning) and the normalized fair share as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)).
2. Calculates the fairness gap as the difference between these normalized values.
3. Applies a non-linear transformation (for example, a logarithmic transformation or a power transform with a fixed exponent between 0 and 1) to the fairness gap after optionally offsetting the values to ensure positiveness. This transformation is intended to reflect diminishing sensitivity to fairness deviations.
4. Introduces three learnable parameters:
   - A baseline bias parameter (beta) with finite bounds of [–10, 10].
   - A sensitivity parameter (gamma) with bounds of [0, 10].
   - A scaling parameter (phi) used to normalize or transform the fairness gap with bounds tightened to [0.5, 1.5] (to better decouple it from the bias and sensitivity parameters).
5. Defines latent utility as: 
   U = beta + gamma × f((normalized_fairness_gap) / phi) 
   where f(·) represents the chosen non-linear transformation.
6. Converts the latent utility U to a probability using the logistic function:
   p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(–U)).
7. Provides the complete mathematical model between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags and includes detailed variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags in JSON format. Ensure that all learnable parameters have explicit finite bounds, and every parameter is clearly connected to observable trial variables.

Emphasize that by using a normalized fairness difference (expressed in percentages) and an alternative transformation with appropriately tightened bounds, your model aims to reduce parameter covariance, improve recovery, and enhance overall fitting metrics such as BIC and accuracy. Be creative in your choice of the non-linear function while ensuring the model remains parsimonious and interpretable from a psychological standpoint.
