For run 31, push the model designer to break out of the strictly additive transformation design by encouraging the exploration of multiplicative and hybrid interactions within the fixed nonlinear components. Suggest testing alternative constant multipliers (even slightly lower or higher than before) and compression exponents, and invite the inclusion of an extra modulation term whose contribution could be combined both additively and multiplicatively with the other terms. The goal is to capture subtle curvature changes and oscillatory dynamics in the fairness gap transformation while still using only three learnable parameters with their original bounds.

For run 31 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision‐making that meets the following requirements:

1. Compute the normalized offer percentage:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning,
  and the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

2. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer − N_share.

3. Scale the fairness gap with phi (with phi learnable within [0.5, 1.5]) to obtain:
  x = F / phi.

4. Apply a fixed nonlinear transformation f(·) to x that must include these fixed terms:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4×|x|)
  • 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|)
  • 0.1×(1 − exp(–|x|))
  • 0.05×(1 − exp(–2×|x|))
  • 0.03×tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|)
  • 0.01×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|))
  • 0.005×exp(–|x|)
  Additionally, you are encouraged to explore adaptive weighting and hybrid interactions by:
  – Applying distinct fixed multipliers to the oscillatory components (for example, you might use 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) and 0.012×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|))).
  – Optionally including an extra modulation term such as 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|) that can be combined additively or multiplicatively with the other terms.
  – Experimenting with combining the sum of these fixed terms and an extra multiplicative interaction factor (for example, multiplying the sum by a term like [1 + 0.01×sin(|x|)]) to smooth out the curvature.
  – Adjusting the fixed constant multiplier C (suggest testing a value near 1.08, but consider slight deviations within [1.05, 1.10]) and the fixed compression exponent E (suggest near 0.92, but values in [0.90, 0.94] are acceptable).
  Formally, define the transformation as:
    f(x) = sign(x) × ( [ C × (|x|^(0.5) + ln(1 + 3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1 − exp(–|x|)) + 0.05×(1 − exp(–2×|x|)) + 0.03×tanh(|x|) + M₁×sin(0.5×|x|) + M₂×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|)) + 0.005×exp(–|x|) [ + optionally, extra modulation terms such as 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|) ] ) × [1 + 0.01×sin(|x|)] + 1e-6 )^(E),
  where C is a fixed constant (suggest near 1.08), E is the fixed compression exponent (suggest near 0.92), and M₁, M₂ are fixed multipliers for the oscillatory terms (experiment with values distinct from the previous design).

5. Use exactly three learnable parameters with the following bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling factor) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

6. Compute the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

7. Derive the acceptance probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(–U)).

8. Provide the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags and supply detailed JSON‐formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

9. Clearly designate the predicted target variable using <target_variable> tags (set to “accept”).

Challenge yourself to innovate by testing hybrid interactions (e.g., combining additive and multiplicative modulation) within the transformation f(x) to smooth the curvature and capture nuanced effects in the data, all while keeping the design strictly to the three learnable parameters.

Good luck!
