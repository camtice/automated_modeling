For run 32, we want to push creativity further by encouraging the model designer to explore hybrid interactions that combine both additive and multiplicative modulation within the fixed nonlinear transformation. The goal is to further improve accuracy, lower BIC, and increase parameter recovery reliability. We encourage slight adjustments to fixed constant multipliers and compression exponents and advice the inclusion of additional oscillatory modulation terms.

For run 32 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision‐making according to the following updated instructions:

1. Compute the normalized offer percentage:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning
and the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

2. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer − N_share.

3. Scale the fairness gap with phi (learnable within [0.5, 1.5]) to obtain:
  x = F / phi.

4. Apply a fixed nonlinear transformation f(x) to x that must include all of the following fixed terms:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4×|x|)
  • 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|)
  • 0.1×(1 − exp(–|x|))
  • 0.05×(1 − exp(–2×|x|))
  • 0.03×tanh(|x|)
  • An oscillatory term with multiplier M₁: use 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|)
  • An oscillatory term with multiplier M₂: use 0.012×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|))
  • 0.005×exp(–|x|)
  Additionally, incorporate extra modulation terms for added curvature:
    – Optionally include 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and/or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|)
    – Combine the sum of these fixed components with an extra multiplicative modulation factor such as [1 + 0.012×sin(|x|)] to further smooth the curvature.
    – Multiply the entire sum by a fixed constant C (choose a value between 1.05 and 1.10) and then add a small offset of 1e-6.
    – Finally, compress the overall value by raising it to a fixed exponent E (set E within [0.90, 0.94], e.g. near 0.92).
Formally, define the transformation as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (|x|^(0.5) + ln(1+3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1−exp(–|x|)) + 0.05×(1−exp(–2×|x|)) + 0.03×tanh(|x|) + 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) + 0.012×(1−cos(0.3×|x|)) + 0.005×exp(–|x|) [ + optionally, 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and/or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|) ] ) × (1 + 0.012×sin(|x|)) + 1e-6 }^(E).

5. Use exactly three learnable parameters with these bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling factor for F) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

6. Compute the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

7. Derive the acceptance probability using a logistic function with temperature 1:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(–U)).

8. Provide the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags and supply detailed JSON‐formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

9. Clearly designate the predicted target variable using <target_variable> tags (set to "accept").

Challenge yourself to innovate by testing novel ways of combining additive and multiplicative modulations within f(x) to capture subtle behavioral effects in the fairness gap, while strictly adhering to using only the three learnable parameters. Be creative with the hybrid interactions to potentially improve parameter recovery and overall model performance.
