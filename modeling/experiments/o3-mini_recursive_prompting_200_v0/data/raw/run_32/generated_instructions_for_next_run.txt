For run 33, we want to further push the boundaries of creativity while retaining strict adherence to using exactly three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi). We aim for improved overall performance (lower BIC, better accuracy, and improved parameter recovery) by encouraging innovative hybrid modulations that blend additive and multiplicative interactions. Consider subtle tweaks to the fixed transformation terms (e.g., adjusting fixed constant multipliers, compression exponents, and including additional oscillatory modulation terms) and consider adding a slight constant inside the additive summation before applying multiplicative factors. The model should still compute a normalized offer (N_offer) and a normalized fair share (N_share), derive the fairness gap F, and then scale it by phi to compute x = F/phi. The transformation f(x) must include all required fixed terms: a power-law term (|x|^(0.5)), logarithmic term (ln(1+3.4×|x|)), arctan, exponential decay, tanh, and two stated oscillatory terms (0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) and 0.012×[1-cos(0.3×|x|)]), plus an extra oscillatory term (choose between 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and/or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|)). Then, creatively combine these with an extra multiplicative modulation factor [1 + 0.012×sin(|x|)] and multiply the entire sum by a constant C between 1.05 and 1.10. Finally, add a tiny offset (1e-6) and compress the resulting sum by raising it to an exponent E (within [0.90, 0.94], e.g. near 0.92). Use the result in computing the latent utility U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi), from which the acceptance probability is derived via the logistic transform. 

In this run, you are encouraged to explore alternative ways to combine additive and multiplicative modulations in f(x) – for example, by introducing a secondary additive term inside the transformation that might account for subtle curvature effects. This may include integrating a small constant bias within the summation prior to the multiplicative modulation. Be creative while ensuring that the final model still uses strictly only the three learnable parameters with bounds: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. Document your complete model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, provide JSON‐formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags, and clearly denote the target variable using <target_variable> tags (set to "accept").

Your goal is to innovate with hybrid interactions to better capture the subtle behavioral effects in the fairness gap.

For run 33, please develop a computational model for responder decision‐making with the following updated instructions:

1. Compute the normalized offer:  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.
2. Compute the normalized fair share:  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).
3. Define the fairness gap as:  F = N_offer − N_share.
4. Scale the fairness gap with phi (learnable, bounds [0.5, 1.5]) to obtain:  x = F / phi.
5. Apply a fixed nonlinear transformation f(x) that must include:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4×|x|)
  • 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|)
  • 0.1×(1 − exp(−|x|))
  • 0.05×(1 − exp(−2×|x|))
  • 0.03×tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|)
  • 0.012×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|))
  • 0.005×exp(−|x|)
  Additionally, optionally include an extra oscillatory modulation term such as 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and/or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|).
  Combine the sum of these fixed components with a multiplicative modulation factor [1 + 0.012×sin(|x|)], multiply the total by a fixed constant C (choose a value between 1.05 and 1.10), add an offset of 1e-6, and compress by raising the sum to an exponent E (set within [0.90, 0.94], e.g., near 0.92).
  Formally, define f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (|x|^(0.5) + ln(1+3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1−exp(−|x|)) + 0.05×(1−exp(−2×|x|)) + 0.03×tanh(|x|) + 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) + 0.012×(1−cos(0.3×|x|)) + 0.005×exp(−|x|) [ + optionally 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and/or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|) ] ) × (1 + 0.012×sin(|x|)) + 1e-6 }^(E).
6. Compute the latent utility as:  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).
7. Derive the acceptance probability using a logistic function:  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).
8. Use exactly three learnable parameters with these bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling factor for F) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].
9. Provide the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, along with detailed JSON‐formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.
10. Clearly designate the predicted target variable using <target_variable> tags (set to "accept").

Challenge yourself to explore innovative combinations of additive and multiplicative terms in f(x) that may yield more accurate predictions, lower BIC values, and improved parameter recovery. Think out of the box about how small additive shifts or combined multiplicative modulations can account for subtle effects in the data.
