For run 34, we want to push creative boundaries even further. The new instructions should invite exploration of additional subtle additive and multiplicative modulations within the fixed nonlinear transformation f(x) while still strictly using only the three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi). Aim to boost accuracy, lower BIC, and improve parameter recovery by allowing innovative tweaks such as incorporating a small constant shift (an extra delta) inside the additive summation before applying the multiplicative modulation. Additionally, encourage experimenting with slight phase shifts in the oscillatory modulation factor (for example, modifying the sine term argument) or applying a dual-modulation where one modulation term is applied after an initial transformation—so as to capture potential nonlinear curvature effects. Overall, preserve the basic framework (normalized offer, fair share, fairness gap, scaling by phi, fixed nonlinear transformation, logistic conversion) but motivate creative re-balancing (for instance, an extra additive term, a modified modulation factor like 1+0.012*sin(|x|+constant), or an alternative combination order) while keeping the learnable parameters limited to beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

For run 34, please develop a computational model for responder decision‐making with the following instructions:

1. Compute the normalized offer:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.

2. Compute the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

3. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer − N_share.

4. Scale the fairness gap with phi (learnable, bounds [0.5, 1.5]) to obtain:
  x = F / phi.

5. Apply a fixed nonlinear transformation f(x) that must include:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4×|x|)
  • 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|)
  • 0.1×(1 − exp(−|x|))
  • 0.05×(1 − exp(−2×|x|))
  • 0.03×tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|)
  • 0.012×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|))
  • 0.005×exp(−|x|)
  Optionally include oscillatory modulation such as 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and/or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|).

6. Enhance f(x) by incorporating a secondary additive shift (e.g., add a small constant delta inside the summation, such as 0.01) before applying the multiplicative modulation factor.

7. Multiply the sum of the fixed components by a multiplicative modulation factor [1 + 0.012×sin(|x| + 0.03)] to allow slight phase shifting, and then by a fixed constant C chosen within [1.05, 1.10].

8. Add an offset of 1e-6.

9. Compress the resulting total by raising it to a fixed exponent E (set within [0.90, 0.94], e.g., near 0.92). Formally, define:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (|x|^(0.5) + ln(1+3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1−exp(−|x|)) + 0.05×(1−exp(−2×|x|)) + 0.03×tanh(|x|) + 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) + 0.012×(1−cos(0.3×|x|)) + 0.005×exp(−|x|) [ + optionally 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and/or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|) ] + 0.01 ) × (1 + 0.012×sin(|x| + 0.03)) + 1e-6 }^(E).

10. Compute the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

11. Derive the acceptance probability using a logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

12. Use exactly three learnable parameters with these bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling factor for F) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

13. Provide the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, along with detailed JSON‐formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

14. Clearly designate the predicted target variable using <target_variable> tags (set to "accept").

Challenge yourself to explore and innovate with these novel hybrid interactions. Consider how the extra additive shift and modified oscillatory modulation might capture subtle behavioral effects that could lead to improved prediction accuracy, lower BIC values, and better parameter recovery.
