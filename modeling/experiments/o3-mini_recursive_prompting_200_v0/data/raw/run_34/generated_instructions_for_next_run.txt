For run 35, we want to push the creative boundaries even further. In these instructions, encourage the model designer to experiment with additional modifications in the fixed nonlinear transformation f(x) without introducing new learnable parameters. Consider allowing a secondary modulation stage after the initial summation that might capture nonlinear curvature, and permit the inclusion of an extra additive constant (delta) inside the summation to slightly shift the transformation. Emphasize the possibility of experimenting with altered phase shifts in the oscillatory modulation component (for example, a sine term with an adjustable phase) or even applying a modulation factor both before and after the power compression. Remind the designer that the overall structure must remain: compute normalized offer and fair share, determine the fairness gap F, scale by phi, apply a fixed transformation with all required components (including |x|^(0.5), ln(1+3.4|x|), 0.2×atan(1.1|x|), etc.), then add an extra small constant (delta ≈ 0.01), multiply by a factor that can include a phase-shifted sine modulation [e.g., 1 + 0.012×sin(|x| + 0.03)], further multiply by a fixed constant C within [1.05, 1.10] (you may even allow a two-tier multiplication where one factor is applied immediately after summation and another after an intermediary transformation), add a tiny offset (1e-6), and finally compress the total with an exponent E (in the vicinity of 0.92). Conclude with computing the latent utility U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi) and mapping U to a probability with the logistic function. Emphasize that exactly three learnable parameters must be used (beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]). Encourage out-of-the-box thinking while keeping the core mathematical structure intact.

For run 35, please develop a computational model for responder decision‐making with the following instructions:

1. Compute the normalized offer:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.

2. Compute the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

3. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer − N_share.

4. Scale the fairness gap with phi (learnable, bounds [0.5, 1.5]) to obtain:
  x = F / phi.

5. Apply a fixed nonlinear transformation f(x) that must include the following components computed on |x|:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4×|x|)
  • 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|)
  • 0.1×(1 − exp(−|x|))
  • 0.05×(1 − exp(−2×|x|))
  • 0.03×tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|)
  • 0.012×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|))
  • 0.005×exp(−|x|)
  Optionally include additional oscillatory modulation terms such as 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and/or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|).

6. Enhance f(x) by adding a secondary additive shift (for example, add a constant delta = 0.01) inside the summation before any modulation is applied.

7. Multiply the resulting sum by a multiplicative modulation factor of the form [1 + 0.012×sin(|x| + 0.03)] to allow slight phase shifting. Then, further multiply by a fixed constant C chosen within the range [1.05, 1.10]. Optionally, consider applying a secondary modulation after an initial transformation step to capture potential curvature effects.

8. Add a final offset of 1e-6.

9. Compress the resulting total by raising it to a fixed exponent E (set near 0.92, within the range [0.90, 0.94]). Formally, define:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (|x|^(0.5) + ln(1+3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1−exp(−|x|)) + 0.05×(1−exp(−2×|x|)) + 0.03×tanh(|x|) + 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) + 0.012×(1−cos(0.3×|x|)) + 0.005×exp(−|x|) [ + optionally 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and/or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|) ] + 0.01 ) × (1+0.012×sin(|x|+0.03)) + 1e-6 }^(E).

10. Compute the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

11. Derive the acceptance probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

12. Use exactly three learnable parameters with these bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10]
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10]
  • phi (scaling factor for F) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

13. Present your complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and provide detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

14. Clearly designate the predicted target variable using <target_variable> tags (set to "accept").

Challenge yourself to incorporate non-obvious interactions, such as dual-modulation stages or innovative phase shifts in the sine terms, to capture subtle behavioral nuances that may lead to improved prediction accuracy, lower BIC values, and better parameter recovery.
