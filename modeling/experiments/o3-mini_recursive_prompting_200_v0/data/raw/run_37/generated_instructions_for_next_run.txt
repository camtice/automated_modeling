For run 38, aim to push the transformation even further by introducing a dual-modulation structure that applies an additional modulation after the initial power compression. This second modulation can capture nonlinear curvature effects while a revised, phase-shifted sine term inside the first modulation may allow for finer oscillatory adjustments. Retain the mandatory components (|x|^(0.5), ln(1+3.4×|x|), 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|), 0.1×(1−exp(−|x|)), 0.05×(1−exp(−2×|x|)), 0.03×tanh(|x|), 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|), 0.012×(1−cos(0.3×|x|)), 0.005×exp(−|x|)) but now require the model designer to optionally add additional oscillatory terms (e.g. 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|)) within the summation. Then, before the first modulation factor, introduce an additive constant delta (≈0.01) to shift the summation. Multiply the sum by a modulation factor [1 + 0.012×sin(|x| + 0.03)] and then by a fixed constant C from [1.05, 1.10]. After this, add an intermediate modulation stage: multiply the result by another factor of the form [1 + 0.008×cos(|x| + 0.05)] to capture additional curvature effects. Finally, add a tiny offset (1e-6) and compress the total with an exponent E (≈0.92, within [0.90, 0.94]). The latent utility remains defined as U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi) and is converted to acceptance probability via the logistic function. Only three parameters are learnable: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. Be creative: experiment with the ordering of additive and multiplicative modulations and consider secondary modulations that might expose intricate nonlinearities to improve accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery.

For run 38, please develop a computational model for responder decision‐making with the following instructions:

1. Compute the normalized offer:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.

2. Compute the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

3. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer − N_share.

4. Scale the fairness gap by phi (learnable, bounds [0.5, 1.5]) to obtain:
  x = F / phi.

5. Apply a fixed nonlinear transformation f(x) that must include these components computed on |x|:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4×|x|)
  • 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|)
  • 0.1×(1 − exp(−|x|))
  • 0.05×(1 − exp(−2×|x|))
  • 0.03×tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|)
  • 0.012×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|))
  • 0.005×exp(−|x|)
  Optionally include additional oscillatory modulation terms (e.g., 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and/or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|)).

6. Enhance f(x) by adding a secondary additive constant delta = 0.01 inside the summation before any modulation is applied.

7. Multiply the resulting sum by a multiplicative modulation factor of the form [1 + 0.012×sin(|x| + 0.03)] and then further multiply by a fixed constant C (choose any value in [1.05, 1.10]). 

8. Introduce an additional modulation stage: after the first multiplication, multiply the result by another factor [1 + 0.008×cos(|x| + 0.05)] to capture extra curvature effects.

9. Add a final tiny offset of 1e-6.

10. Compress the resulting total by raising it to a fixed exponent E (set near 0.92 within [0.90, 0.94]). Formally, define:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (|x|^(0.5) + ln(1 + 3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1 − exp(−|x|)) + 0.05×(1 − exp(−2×|x|)) + 0.03×tanh(|x|) + 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) + 0.012×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|)) + 0.005×exp(−|x|) [ + optionally 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and/or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|) ] + 0.01 ) × (1 + 0.012×sin(|x| + 0.03)) × (1 + 0.008×cos(|x| + 0.05)) + 1e-6 ]^(E).

11. Compute the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

12. Derive the acceptance probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

13. Use exactly three learnable parameters:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10]
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10]
  • phi (scaling factor for F) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

14. Present your complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and provide detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

15. Clearly designate the predicted target variable using <target_variable> tags (set to "accept").

Challenge yourself with out-of-the-box thinking; consider innovative phase shifts, dual modulation stages, and secondary curvature effects to capture subtle behavioral nuances that lead to improved accuracy, lower BIC values, and enhanced parameter recovery.
