For run 39, let's push the nonlinear transformation further by adding an extra modulation stage after the initial modulation. Experiment with adding a secondary oscillatory modulation (for example, an extra sine term with a small amplitude and phase shift) that multiplies the already modulated signal. This extra modulation may help capture additional curvature effects and subtle nonlinearities, potentially enhancing accuracy, lowering BIC, and improving parameter recovery. Retain all mandatory components, but allow the optional oscillatory terms to be used or omitted as the modeler sees fit. Encourage creative reordering of additive constants and multiplicative modulations. Also, invite exploration of phase shifts in the sine and cosine adjustments to expose intricate patterns. Use exactly three learnable parameters (beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]) and ensure the full formal specification is provided between the <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, with detailed JSON variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> and the target variable clearly marked within <target_variable> tags.

For run 39, please develop a computational model for responder decision‐making with the following instructions:

1. Compute the normalized offer:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.

2. Compute the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

3. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer − N_share.

4. Scale the fairness gap by phi (learnable, bounds [0.5, 1.5]) to obtain:
  x = F / phi.

5. Compute a fixed nonlinear transformation f(x) on |x| that must include these mandatory components:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4×|x|)
  • 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|)
  • 0.1×(1 − exp(−|x|))
  • 0.05×(1 − exp(−2×|x|))
  • 0.03×tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|)
  • 0.012×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|))
  • 0.005×exp(−|x|)
  Optionally include additional oscillatory modulation terms (e.g., 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and/or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|)).

6. Enhance the summation by adding an additive constant delta = 0.01 to the above sum before any modulations.

7. Multiply the constant-shifted sum by a multiplicative modulation factor of the form [1 + 0.012×sin(|x| + 0.03)].

8. Further multiply by a fixed constant C (choose any value within [1.05, 1.10]).

9. Introduce an additional modulation stage by multiplying the result by another curvature factor [1 + 0.008×cos(|x| + 0.05)].

10. To further allow for fine adjustment of nonlinear curvature, multiply by a secondary modulation factor [1 + 0.005×sin(|x| + 0.10)].

11. Add a final tiny offset 1e-6.

12. Compress the resulting total by raising it to a fixed exponent E (choose a value near 0.92 within the interval [0.90, 0.94]). Formally, define:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (|x|^(0.5) + ln(1 + 3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1 − exp(−|x|)) + 0.05×(1 − exp(−2×|x|)) + 0.03×tanh(|x|) + 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) + 0.012×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|)) + 0.005×exp(−|x|) [ + optionally 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and/or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|) ] + 0.01 ) × (1 + 0.012×sin(|x| + 0.03)) × (1 + 0.008×cos(|x| + 0.05)) × (1 + 0.005×sin(|x| + 0.10)) + 1e-6 ]^(E).

13. Compute the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

14. Derive the acceptance probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

15. Use exactly three learnable parameters:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10]
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10]
  • phi (scaling factor for F) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

16. Present the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and provide detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

17. Clearly designate the predicted target variable using <target_variable> tags (set to "accept").

Please be creative, explore alternative phase shifts and modulation stages, and consider innovative reordering of additive and multiplicative operations to expose subtle nonlinear patterns that may improve overall model performance.
