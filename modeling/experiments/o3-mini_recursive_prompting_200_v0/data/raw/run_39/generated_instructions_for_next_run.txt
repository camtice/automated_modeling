For run 40, we want to encourage even more creative nonlinear modulation stages while still strictly using only three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi). In this iteration, ask the modeler to experiment with reordering the additive and multiplicative steps and consider an extra modulation stage that uses a different oscillatory function (for instance, a cosine modulation with a phase shift, or even a product that includes both sine and cosine together). Emphasize the possibility to adjust the order of operations to capture subtle nonlinear curvature effects. Encourage out‐of‐the-box thinking such as dynamically interleaving logarithmic and power-law components before performing the multiplicative modulations, or even introducing an extra modulation term (for instance, [1+0.004×cos(|x|+0.07)]) after the secondary sine modulation. The goal is to improve overall accuracy, reduce the BIC, and enhance parameter recovery by providing additional degrees of fixed nonlinear adjustments while preserving exactly three free parameters.

For run 40, please develop an innovative computational model for responder decision‐making following these instructions:

1. Compute the normalized offer:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.

2. Compute the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

3. Define the fairness gap:
  F = N_offer − N_share.

4. Scale the fairness gap by phi (learnable, bounds [0.5, 1.5]):
  x = F / phi.

5. Compute a fixed nonlinear transformation on |x| that must include these mandatory components:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4×|x|)
  • 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|)
  • 0.1×(1 − exp(−|x|))
  • 0.05×(1 − exp(−2×|x|))
  • 0.03×tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|)
  • 0.012×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|))
  • 0.005×exp(−|x|)
  Optionally include one or more additional oscillatory terms (for example, 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and/or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|)).

6. Add an additive constant delta = 0.01 to the sum of these components before any modulations.

7. Multiply the result by a modulation factor [1 + 0.012×sin(|x| + 0.03)].

8. Multiply by a fixed constant C chosen from [1.05, 1.10].

9. Introduce a first additional modulation: multiply by [1 + 0.008×cos(|x| + 0.05)].

10. Introduce a secondary modulation stage by multiplying by [1 + 0.005×sin(|x| + 0.10)].

11. For run 40, add an extra modulation stage to explore subtle curvature effects: multiply by an extra factor [1 + 0.004×cos(|x| + 0.07)].

12. Add a final tiny offset 1e-6.

13. Compress the fully modulated signal by raising it to a fixed exponent E (choose E ∈ [0.90, 0.94], near 0.92).

14. Define the nonlinear transformation as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (|x|^(0.5) + ln(1 + 3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1 − exp(−|x|)) + 0.05×(1 − exp(−2×|x|)) + 0.03×tanh(|x|) + 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) + 0.012×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|)) + 0.005×exp(−|x|) [ + optionally 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and/or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|) ] + 0.01 ) × (1 + 0.012×sin(|x| + 0.03)) × (1 + 0.008×cos(|x| + 0.05)) × (1 + 0.005×sin(|x| + 0.10)) × (1 + 0.004×cos(|x| + 0.07)) + 1e-6 ]^(E).

15. Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F / phi).

16. Derive the acceptance probability:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

17. Use exactly three learnable parameters:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10]
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10]
  • phi (scaling factor) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

18. Present the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and provide detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags. Clearly designate the predicted target variable using <target_variable> tags (set to "accept").

Encourage creative exploration of alternative phase shifts, reordering of additive and multiplicative operations, and extra modulation stages to capture intricate nonlinearities that enhance model fit, lower BIC, and improve parameter recovery.
