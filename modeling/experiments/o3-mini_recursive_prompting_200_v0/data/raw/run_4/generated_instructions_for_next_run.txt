For run 5, we want to encourage even more innovative transformations while still maintaining the core approach of a normalized fairness gap. Instead of the logarithmic transformation used previously, we can suggest a power transformation—a non-linear function such as f(x) = sign(x) × |x|^0.5—to capture diminishing sensitivity. This transformation is simple yet effective and might improve parameter recovery (especially for gamma and phi) and overall model fit (BIC and accuracy). Emphasize that the fairness gap should be calculated based on percentages (split_self/combined_earning compared to token_self/(token_self + token_opp)). Ask the model to be creative, consider potential offsets if necessary, and clearly justify the chosen transformation. The learnable parameters remain beta (with bounds [-10, 10]), gamma (bounds [0,10]), and phi (bounds [0.5,1.5]), and these should be explicitly connected in the mathematical model with a clear description of each parameter’s role. Also, ensure that after the utility function is computed, the probability of acceptance is derived via a logistic function with temperature 1. The resulting math should be fully encapsulated between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and the variable descriptions should be provided in detailed JSON format between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags. Avoid redundant information and strive for clarity and parsimony in your presentation.

For run 5 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making that:
1. Computes the normalized offer as split_self/combined_earning and the normalized fair share as token_self/(token_self+token_opp), both expressed as percentages.
2. Calculates the fairness gap as: normalized_fairness_gap = (split_self/combined_earning) - (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)).
3. Applies a power transformation to the fairness gap to capture diminishing sensitivity. Specifically, use f(x) = sgn(x) × |x|^0.5. (Consider any necessary adjustments, such as an offset if required, to ensure numerical stability.)
4. Introduces three learnable parameters with explicit finite bounds:
   • A baseline bias parameter (beta) bounded between -10 and 10.
   • A sensitivity parameter (gamma) bounded between 0 and 10.
   • A scaling parameter (phi) bounded between 0.5 and 1.5 that standardizes the fairness gap before transformation.
5. Defines the latent utility as:
   U = beta + gamma × f((normalized_fairness_gap)/phi)
   where f(·) represents the power transformation defined above.
6. Converts the latent utility to a probability using the logistic function:
   p_accept = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
7. Provides the full mathematical model between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags and the variable descriptions in detailed JSON format between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags. Ensure that every variable and learnable parameter is clearly defined and connected to the observable trial variables.

By using a power transformation on the normalized fairness gap, your model aims to capture diminishing sensitivity more robustly. This approach may lower the BIC, improve parameter recovery, and increase overall accuracy. Experiment with creative yet interpretable modifications if needed, and ensure that all components and bounds are explicitly stated.
