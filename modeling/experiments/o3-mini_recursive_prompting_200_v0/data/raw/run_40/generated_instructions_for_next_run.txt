For run 41, we want to push the envelope even further. In this iteration, instruct the modeler to explore additional modulation stages and consider reordering the additive and multiplicative operations. Encourage the use of an extra combined sine-cosine modulation stage to capture subtle curvature, and suggest experimenting with interleaving logarithmic with power-law components before applying multiplicative modulations. Remind the modeler to adhere strictly to only three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi) with the given bounds, while allowing fixed constants to be flexibly incorporated. The goal is to facilitate improved accuracy, lower BIC, and stronger parameter recovery.

For run 41, please develop an innovative computational model for responder decision‐making following these instructions:

1. Compute the normalized offer:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.

2. Compute the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

3. Define the fairness gap:
  F = N_offer − N_share.

4. Scale the fairness gap by phi (learnable, bounds [0.5, 1.5]):
  x = F / phi.

5. Compute a fixed nonlinear transformation on |x| including these mandatory components:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4×|x|)
  • 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|)
  • 0.1×(1 − exp(−|x|))
  • 0.05×(1 − exp(−2×|x|))
  • 0.03×tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|)
  • 0.012×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|))
  • 0.005×exp(−|x|)
  Optionally include additional oscillatory terms such as 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and/or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|).

6. Add an additive constant delta = 0.01 to the sum of these components.

7. Multiply the sum by the modulation factor: [1 + 0.012×sin(|x| + 0.03)].

8. Multiply by a fixed constant C chosen from [1.05, 1.10].

9. Introduce a first additional modulation by multiplying with [1 + 0.008×cos(|x| + 0.05)].

10. Introduce a secondary modulation by multiplying with [1 + 0.005×sin(|x| + 0.10)].

11. Add an extra modulation stage to explore subtle curvature by multiplying with [1 + 0.004×cos(|x| + 0.07)].

12. Additionally, incorporate a combined sine-cosine modulation stage by multiplying with [1 + 0.006×(sin(|x| + 0.02)×cos(|x| + 0.04))].

13. Add a final tiny offset 1e-6.

14. Compress the fully modulated signal by raising it to a fixed exponent E (choose E ∈ [0.90, 0.94], near 0.92).

15. Define the nonlinear transformation as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (|x|^(0.5) + ln(1 + 3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1 − exp(−|x|)) + 0.05×(1 − exp(−2×|x|)) + 0.03×tanh(|x|) + 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) + 0.012×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|)) + 0.005×exp(−|x|) [ + optionally 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and/or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|) ] + 0.01 ) × (1 + 0.012×sin(|x| + 0.03)) × (1 + 0.008×cos(|x| + 0.05)) × (1 + 0.005×sin(|x| + 0.10)) × (1 + 0.004×cos(|x| + 0.07)) × (1 + 0.006×(sin(|x| + 0.02)×cos(|x| + 0.04))) + 1e-6 ]^(E).

16. Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F / phi).

17. Derive the acceptance probability:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

18. Use exactly three learnable parameters:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10]
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10]
  • phi (scaling factor) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Present the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and provide detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags. Clearly designate the predicted target variable using <target_variable> tags (set to "accept").

Encourage creative exploration of alternative phase shifts, reordering of additive and multiplicative operations, and extra modulation stages to capture intricate nonlinearities for improved accuracy, reduced BIC, and enhanced parameter recovery.
