For run 43, further push the boundaries by encouraging creative reordering and blending of nonlinear transformations. Consider mixing the logarithmic and power-law terms multiplicatively before summing with the other mandatory modulation components. Explore introducing extra nonlinear compression—such as applying an extra tanh modulation stage on the blended signal—prior to the final exponentiation. Keep the three learnable parameters strictly defined (beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]). Emphasize experimenting with alternative phase shifts and secondary oscillatory modulations (for instance, a combined sine-cosine blend with a different phase offset) to capture subtle nonlinearities that might improve predictive power, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery. Think beyond the obvious and apply creative reordering to further interweave the additive and multiplicative stages.

For run 43, please develop an innovative computational model for responder decision‐making with these instructions:

1. Compute the normalized offer:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.

2. Compute the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

3. Define the fairness gap:
  F = N_offer − N_share.

4. Scale the fairness gap by phi (learnable, bounds [0.5, 1.5]):
  x = F / phi.

5. Create a fixed nonlinear transformation for |x| that interleaves additive and multiplicative modulations. Compute the following mandatory components on |x|:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4×|x|)
  • 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|)
  • 0.1×(1 − exp(−|x|))
  • 0.05×(1 − exp(−2×|x|))
  • 0.03×tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|)
  • 0.012×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|))
  • 0.005×exp(−|x|)
  Optionally, include additional terms like 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|).

6. Sum these computed components and add a constant delta = 0.01.

7. Introduce a first modulation by multiplying this sum with a factor [1 + 0.012×sin(|x| + 0.03)].

8. Before applying further modulations, creatively reorganize the operations by interleaving the logarithmic term with the power-law term—e.g., let:
  Intermediate_Signal = (|x|^(0.5) * ln(1 + 3.4×|x|)),
  then add the remaining components (atan, exponential, tanh, and sine/cosine terms).

9. Multiply the resulting signal by a fixed constant C chosen from [1.05, 1.10].

10. Apply additional modulation stages sequentially:
  a. Multiply with [1 + 0.008×cos(|x| + 0.05)].
  b. Multiply with [1 + 0.005×sin(|x| + 0.10)].
  c. Multiply with [1 + 0.004×cos(|x| + 0.07)].
  d. Incorporate a combined sine-cosine modulation with [1 + 0.006×(sin(|x| + 0.02)×cos(|x| + 0.04))].
  e. Optionally, add an extra modulation stage such as [1 + 0.003×(sin(|x| + 0.015)×cos(|x| + 0.035))].

11. Optionally, apply an extra nonlinear blending stage where you modulate the current signal with a hyperbolic tangent (or similar function) to compress extreme values further.

12. Add a final tiny offset of 1e-6 for numerical stability.

13. Compress the fully modulated signal by raising it to a fixed exponent E (choose E ∈ [0.90, 0.94], for example, E ≈ 0.92).

14. Define the final nonlinear transformation as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (combined components as above with delta and creative reordering) × (all modulation factors combined, including any extra nonlinear blending) + 1e-6 ]^(E) }.

15. Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F / phi).

16. Derive the acceptance probability:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

Ensure the model uses exactly three learnable parameters:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10].
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10].
  • phi (scaling factor) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Present your complete mathematical model between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags and provide detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags. Clearly designate the predicted target variable using <target_variable> tags (set to “accept”).

Encourage out-of-the-box exploration of these interwoven additive and multiplicative operations and phase-shift variations to capture subtle nonlinear interactions that could lower BIC, improve accuracy, and enhance parameter recovery.
