For run 44, we want to push the boundaries even further. The instructions should encourage experimenting with unconventional blending of the power-law and logarithmic components, adding an extra tanh modulation stage prior to exponentiation, and exploring additional phase shifts in the oscillatory modulations. We should also stress that any modifications must maintain exactly three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi) and should explicitly mention the desired bounds. The goal is to lower BIC, increase overall accuracy, and improve the parameter recovery correlations. Emphasize out-of-the-box reordering of computations and creative nonlinearity blending.

For run 44, please develop an innovative computational model for responder decision‐making with the following revised instructions:

1. Compute the normalized offer:  
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.

2. Compute the normalized fair share:  
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

3. Define the fairness gap:  
  F = N_offer − N_share.

4. Scale the fairness gap by phi (learnable, bounds [0.5, 1.5]):  
  x = F / phi.

5. For the absolute value |x|, compute the following mandatory components:
  • |x|^(0.5)  
  • ln(1 + 3.4×|x|)  
  • 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|)  
  • 0.1×(1 − exp(−|x|))  
  • 0.05×(1 − exp(−2×|x|))  
  • 0.03×tanh(|x|)  
  • 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|)  
  • 0.012×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|))  
  • 0.005×exp(−|x|)  
  Optionally, include additional terms such as 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|).

6. Sum all computed components and add a constant delta = 0.01.

7. Modulate the summed signal by multiplying with the factor [1 + 0.012×sin(|x| + 0.03)].

8. Reorganize the operations by multiplying the power-law term with the logarithmic term to form an Intermediate_Signal, then add the remaining components (atan, exponential, tanh, sine, cosine terms, etc.).

9. Multiply the resulting signal by a fixed constant C drawn from [1.05, 1.10].

10. Apply additional sequential modulation stages:
  a. Multiply with [1 + 0.008×cos(|x| + 0.05)].
  b. Multiply with [1 + 0.005×sin(|x| + 0.10)].
  c. Multiply with [1 + 0.004×cos(|x| + 0.07)].
  d. Multiply with [1 + 0.006×(sin(|x| + 0.02)×cos(|x| + 0.04))].
  e. Optionally, include an extra modulation stage such as [1 + 0.003×(sin(|x| + 0.015)×cos(|x| + 0.035))].

11. Introduce an extra nonlinear blending stage: apply a hyperbolic tangent to the blended signal to compress extreme values before final compression.

12. Add a final tiny offset of 1e-6 for numerical stability.

13. Compress the fully modulated signal by raising it to a fixed exponent E, with E chosen from [0.90, 0.94] (e.g., E ≈ 0.92).

14. Define the final nonlinear transformation as:  
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (Combined Sums from above, including delta and the power-log blend) × (Product of all modulation factors, including the extra tanh blending) + 1e-6 ]^(E) }.

15. Compute the latent utility:  
  U = beta + gamma × f(F / phi).

16. Derive the acceptance probability:  
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

Ensure that exactly three learnable parameters are used:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10].  
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10].  
  • phi (scaling factor) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Present your complete mathematical model between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, provide detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags, and clearly designate the predicted target variable using <target_variable> tags (set to “accept”).

Encourage creative reordering and blending of the additive and multiplicative operations, innovative phase shifts, and additional nonlinear compressions to fully capture subtle interactions that can improve accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery.
