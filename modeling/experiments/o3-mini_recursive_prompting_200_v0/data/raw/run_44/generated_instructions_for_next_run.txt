For run 45, push the model to explore even more creative nonlinear blending and reordering of operations. Encourage the inclusion of additional nonlinear compression stages—such as an extra tanh modulation prior to the final exponentiation—and permit unconventional combinations of additive and multiplicative factors. Emphasize testing alternative phase shifts in the oscillatory modulations. Remind the model that exactly three learnable parameters must be used (beta, gamma, phi) with bounds: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. The goal is to improve overall prediction accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery.

For run 45, please develop an innovative computational model for responder decision‐making by following these instructions:

1. Compute the normalized offer:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.

2. Compute the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

3. Define the fairness gap:
  F = N_offer − N_share.

4. Scale the fairness gap by the learnable parameter phi (bounds [0.5, 1.5]):
  x = F / phi.

5. For the absolute value |x|, compute the mandatory nonlinear components:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4×|x|)
  • 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|)
  • 0.1×(1 − exp(−|x|))
  • 0.05×(1 − exp(−2×|x|))
  • 0.03×tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|)
  • 0.012×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|))
  • 0.005×exp(−|x|)
  Optionally, implement additional terms like 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|).

6. Sum all these computed components and add a constant delta = 0.01.

7. Modulate this sum by multiplying with a factor [1 + 0.012×sin(|x| + 0.03)].

8. Reorder operations by forming an Intermediate_Signal that multiplies the power-law term with the logarithmic term and then adds the remaining components (atan, exponential, tanh, sine, cosine, etc.).

9. Multiply the resulting signal by a fixed constant C chosen from [1.05, 1.10].

10. Apply additional sequential modulation stages:
  a. Multiply with [1 + 0.008×cos(|x| + 0.05)].
  b. Multiply with [1 + 0.005×sin(|x| + 0.10)].
  c. Multiply with [1 + 0.004×cos(|x| + 0.07)].
  d. Multiply with [1 + 0.006×(sin(|x| + 0.02)×cos(|x| + 0.04))].
  e. Optionally, include an extra stage such as [1 + 0.003×(sin(|x| + 0.015)×cos(|x| + 0.035))].

11. Introduce an extra nonlinear blending stage: apply a hyperbolic tangent to the blended signal to compress extreme values before final compression.

12. Add a final tiny offset of 1e-6 for numerical stability.

13. Compress the fully modulated signal by raising it to a fixed exponent E (choose E from approximately 0.90 to 0.94, e.g., E = 0.92).

14. Define the final nonlinear transformation as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (Combined Sums of the mandatory components with delta and the power-log blend) × (Product of all modulation factors, including the extra tanh blending) + 1e-6 ]^(E) }.

15. Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F / phi).

16. Convert U to an acceptance probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

Ensure that exactly three learnable parameters are used:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10]
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10]
  • phi (scaling factor) ∈ [0.5, 1.5]

Think boldly and creatively about the ordering and blending of all additive and multiplicative operations, exploring alternative phase shifts and extra nonlinear compressions that may capture subtle interactions—this out-of-the-box approach is intended to improve overall accuracy, reduce the BIC, and enhance the parameter recovery correlations.
