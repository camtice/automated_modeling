For run 46, we want the model to push even further on creative nonlinear blending strategies. Emphasize experimenting with extra nonlinearity phases – for example, adding an additional tanh compression stage after the sequential modulations or mixing different nonlinear mapping functions (e.g., softsign or relu-like transforms) before the final exponentiation. Remind the model to maintain exactly three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, and phi) with beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. Encourage the exploration of alternative phase shifts in oscillatory terms (try different phase constants) as well as the inclusion of an extra blending layer. The goal is to further enhance prediction accuracy, reduce the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and improve parameter recovery correlations.

For run 46, please develop an innovative computational model for responder decision-making by following these updated instructions:

1. Compute the normalized offer:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.

2. Compute the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

3. Define the fairness gap:
  F = N_offer − N_share.

4. Scale the fairness gap by the learnable parameter phi (bounds [0.5, 1.5]):
  x = F / phi.

5. For the absolute value |x|, compute the mandatory nonlinear components:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × |x|)
  • 0.2 × atan(1.1 × |x|)
  • 0.1 × (1 − exp(−|x|))
  • 0.05 × (1 − exp(−2 × |x|))
  • 0.03 × tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × |x|)
  • 0.012 × (1 − cos(0.3 × |x|))
  • 0.005 × exp(−|x|)
  Optionally, also compute additional terms such as 0.005 × sin(2.2 × |x|) and 0.002 × cos(3.0 × |x|).

6. Sum all these computed components and add a constant delta = 0.01.

7. Modulate this sum by multiplying it with a factor of [1 + 0.012 × sin(|x| + 0.03)].

8. Reorder operations by creating an Intermediate_Signal that multiplies the power-law term with the logarithmic term and then adds all the remaining computed terms (atan, exponential, tanh, additional sine and cosine components, etc.).

9. Multiply the resulting signal by a fixed constant C chosen within [1.05, 1.10].

10. Apply sequential modulation stages:
  a. Multiply with [1 + 0.008 × cos(|x| + 0.05)].
  b. Multiply with [1 + 0.005 × sin(|x| + 0.10)].
  c. Multiply with [1 + 0.004 × cos(|x| + 0.07)].
  d. Multiply with [1 + 0.006 × (sin(|x| + 0.02) × cos(|x| + 0.04))].
  e. Optionally, include a further multiplicative stage such as [1 + 0.003 × (sin(|x| + 0.015) × cos(|x| + 0.035))].

11. Introduce an extra nonlinear blending stage by applying a hyperbolic tangent to the modulated signal to compress extreme values before the final combination.

12. Add a small constant offset of 1e-6 for numerical stability.

13. Compress the fully modulated signal by raising it to a fixed exponent E (suggest E = 0.92, but feel free to test within 0.90–0.94).

14. Define the final nonlinear transformation as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (Combined mandatory components, including the power-log blend with delta) × (Product of all modulation factors including the extra tanh blending) + 1e-6 ]^(E) }.

15. Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F / phi).

16. Convert U to an acceptance probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

Remember to use exactly three learnable parameters: 
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10]
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10]
  • phi (scaling factor) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Feel free to explore unconventional combinations of additive and multiplicative operations and alternative phase shifts in the oscillatory modulations. Out-of-the-box thinking is encouraged to further improve accuracy, lower the BIC, and enhance parameter recovery correlations.
