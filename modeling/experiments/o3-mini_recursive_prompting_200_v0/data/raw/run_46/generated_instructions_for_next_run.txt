For run 47, the goal is to further push creative nonlinear blending. Encourage exploration of an additional nonlinear compression stage and mixing alternative nonlinear mappings such as softsign or relu-like transforms alongside the tanh stage. Also, experiment with slightly adjusted phase shifts in the oscillatory modulations to capture subtle variations in fairness sensitivity. Consider inserting an extra multiplicative layer that combines an exponential decay factor with a softsign transform before the final exponentiation. All the while, remember to maintain exactly three learnable parameters—beta (baseline bias), gamma (sensitivity), and phi (scaling)—with beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. Aim to improve prediction accuracy, reduce BIC, and enhance parameter recovery. Think outside the usual framework and propose layered nonlinear processes that combine additive and multiplicative operations in unconventional ways.

For run 47, please develop an innovative computational model for responder decision-making by following these updated instructions:

1. Compute the normalized offer:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.

2. Compute the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

3. Define the fairness gap:
  F = N_offer − N_share.

4. Scale the fairness gap by the learnable parameter phi (with bounds [0.5, 1.5]):
  x = F / phi.

5. For the absolute value |x|, calculate the core nonlinear components:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × |x|)
  • 0.2 × atan(1.1 × |x|)
  • 0.1 × (1 − exp(−|x|))
  • 0.05 × (1 − exp(−2 × |x|))
  • 0.03 × tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × |x|)
  • 0.012 × (1 − cos(0.3 × |x|))
  • 0.005 × exp(−|x|)
  Optionally include additional terms such as 0.005 × sin(2.2 × |x|) and 0.002 × cos(3.0 × |x|).

6. Sum all these computed terms and add a constant delta = 0.01.

7. Modulate the sum by multiplying with a factor [1 + 0.012 × sin(|x| + 0.03)].

8. Reorder operations by creating an Intermediate_Signal that multiplies the power-law term and logarithmic term, then adds the remaining computed components (atan, exponential, tanh, and additional sinusoidal terms).

9. Multiply the Intermediate_Signal by a fixed constant C chosen within [1.05, 1.10].

10. Apply sequential modulation stages:
  a. Multiply with [1 + 0.008 × cos(|x| + 0.05)].
  b. Multiply with [1 + 0.005 × sin(|x| + 0.10)].
  c. Multiply with [1 + 0.004 × cos(|x| + 0.07)].
  d. Multiply with [1 + 0.006 × (sin(|x| + 0.02) × cos(|x| + 0.04))].
  e. Optionally, include an extra stage such as [1 + 0.003 × (sin(|x| + 0.015) × cos(|x| + 0.035))].

11. Introduce an extra nonlinear blending layer by applying a hyperbolic tangent (or alternatively, a softsign transform) to the modulated signal to compress extremes before the final combination.

12. Further blend the signal by incorporating an exponential decay factor (e.g., exp(−|x|/k) with a small constant k) combined with a softsign transform; use this as an extra multiplicative modulation layer.

13. Add a small constant offset of 1e-6 for numerical stability.

14. Compress the fully modulated signal by raising it to a fixed exponent E (suggest E = 0.92, but exploring values in [0.90, 0.94] is encouraged).

15. Define the final nonlinear transformation as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (Combined mandatory components, including the power-log blend with delta) × (Product of all modulation factors, including the extra tanh/softsign blending and exponential decay) + 1e-6 ]^(E) }.

16. Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F / phi).

17. Convert U to an acceptance probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

Ensure to use exactly three learnable parameters with the following bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10]
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10]
  • phi (scaling factor) ∈ [0.5, 1.5]

Feel free to experiment with alternative nonlinear mapping functions (such as softsign or relu-like functions) and unconventional phase shifts in the oscillatory modulators. Out-of-the-box thinking is encouraged to further enhance prediction accuracy, lower the BIC, and improve parameter recovery correlations.
