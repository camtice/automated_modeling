For run 48, we want to push further by mixing additional nonlinear mapping functions with slight modifications on phase shifts and modulation constants. Encourage exploration of alternative functions beyond tanh—such as softplus, softsign, or even a relu-like transform in the extra blending layer—to better capture the subtle variations in fairness sensitivity. Also, suggest integrating an extra multiplicative layer that blends an exponential decay factor with a softsign mapping before the final compression, and adjust the phase shift constants in the sinusoidal modulators slightly (e.g., add 0.005 to each phase shift) to capture any unmodeled variability. Ensure that the model still has exactly three learnable parameters (beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]). These modifications are meant to improve prediction accuracy, lower the BIC, and enhance parameter recovery correlations by capturing nonlinearities in a more flexible and layered manner.

For run 48, please develop an innovative computational model for responder decision-making by following these instructions:

1. Compute the normalized offer:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.

2. Compute the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

3. Define the fairness gap:
  F = N_offer − N_share.

4. Scale the fairness gap by the learnable parameter phi (with bounds [0.5, 1.5]):
  x = F / phi.

5. For the absolute value |x|, compute the core nonlinear components:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × |x|)
  • 0.2 × atan(1.1 × |x|)
  • 0.1 × (1 − exp(−|x|))
  • 0.05 × (1 − exp(−2 × |x|))
  • 0.03 × tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × |x|)
  • 0.012 × (1 − cos(0.3 × |x|))
  • 0.005 × exp(−|x|)
  Optionally include extra terms such as 0.005 × sin(2.2 × |x|) and 0.002 × cos(3.0 × |x|).

6. Sum all computed terms and add a constant delta = 0.01.

7. Modulate the sum with a factor [1 + 0.012 × sin(|x| + 0.035)] (note the slight phase shift adjustment).

8. Combine operations by forming an Intermediate_Signal that multiplies the power-law term and the logarithmic term, then adds the other components (atan, exponential, tanh, and additional sinusoidal terms).

9. Multiply the Intermediate_Signal by a fixed constant C chosen in the range [1.05, 1.10].

10. Apply sequential modulation stages with slight phase modifications:
  a. Multiply by [1 + 0.008 × cos(|x| + 0.055)].
  b. Multiply by [1 + 0.005 × sin(|x| + 0.105)].
  c. Multiply by [1 + 0.004 × cos(|x| + 0.075)].
  d. Multiply by [1 + 0.006 × (sin(|x| + 0.025) × cos(|x| + 0.045))].
  e. Optionally, include an extra stage [1 + 0.003 × (sin(|x| + 0.02) × cos(|x| + 0.04))].

11. Introduce an extra nonlinear blending layer by applying an alternative mapping function (e.g., softplus or softsign, or a relu-like transformation if appropriate) to compress extreme values before the final combination.

12. Further blend the signal by incorporating an extra multiplicative layer that combines an exponential decay factor (e.g., exp(−|x|/k) for a small constant k) with a softsign transform of the signal, thereby amplifying small differences.

13. Add a small constant offset of 1e-6 for numerical stability.

14. Compress the fully modulated signal by raising it to a fixed exponent E (suggest using E = 0.92, but values between 0.90 and 0.94 may also be explored).

15. Define the final nonlinear transformation as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (combined mandatory components from the power-log blend with delta) × (product of all modulation factors, including the extra blending layer with softplus/softsign and the exponential decay modulation) + 1e-6 ]^(E) }.

16. Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

17. Convert U to an acceptance probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

Remember, use exactly three learnable parameters with the following bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling factor) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Encourage out-of-the-box thinking and creative layering of nonlinear processes to further improve prediction accuracy, reduce the BIC, and enhance parameter recovery correlations.
