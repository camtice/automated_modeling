For run 49, further enhance the nonlinear transformation by exploring alternative mapping functions. In particular, replace the extra blending layer with a softplus transform (or experiment with a ReLU-like transformation) to compress extreme values more smoothly. Also, add an extra multiplicative modulation by blending an exponential decay factor (with a small decay constant k, e.g., k = 0.1) with a softsign mapping of the intermediate signal. Additionally, slightly adjust all phase-shift constants in the sinusoidal modulation factors by adding 0.005 to each (e.g., instead of sin(|x|+0.035), use sin(|x|+0.04)). Ensure the overall structure remains: compute the normalized offer, normalized fair share, fairness gap F, and then scale by phi (with bounds [0.5, 1.5]). Use exactly three learnable parameters: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

For run 49, please develop an innovative computational model for responder decision-making with the following instructions:

1. Compute the normalized offer:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.

2. Compute the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

3. Define the fairness gap:
  F = N_offer − N_share.

4. Scale the fairness gap by the learnable parameter phi (with bounds [0.5, 1.5]):
  x = F / phi.

5. For the absolute value |x|, compute the core nonlinear components:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × |x|)
  • 0.2 × atan(1.1 × |x|)
  • 0.1 × (1 − exp(−|x|))
  • 0.05 × (1 − exp(−2 × |x|))
  • 0.03 × tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × |x|)
  • 0.012 × (1 − cos(0.3 × |x|))
  • 0.005 × exp(−|x|)
  Optionally include extra terms such as 0.005 × sin(2.2 × |x|) and 0.002 × cos(3.0 × |x|).

6. Sum all computed terms and add a constant delta = 0.01.

7. Modulate the sum with a factor [1 + 0.012 × sin(|x| + 0.04)] (note the phase shift adjustment).

8. Form an Intermediate_Signal by multiplying the power-law term with the logarithmic term and adding the remaining nonlinear components (atan, exponential, tanh, and additional sinusoidal terms).

9. Multiply the Intermediate_Signal by a fixed constant C (selected in the range [1.05, 1.10]).

10. Apply sequential modulation stages with slight phase modifications:
  a. Multiply by [1 + 0.008 × cos(|x| + 0.06)].
  b. Multiply by [1 + 0.005 × sin(|x| + 0.11)].
  c. Multiply by [1 + 0.004 × cos(|x| + 0.08)].
  d. Multiply by [1 + 0.006 × (sin(|x| + 0.03) × cos(|x| + 0.05))].
  e. Optionally, add an extra modulation stage [1 + 0.003 × (sin(|x| + 0.025) × cos(|x| + 0.045))].

11. Introduce an extra nonlinear blending layer by applying a softplus transformation (or experiment with a ReLU-like alternative) to the modulated signal, compressing extreme values.

12. Further blend the signal with an extra multiplicative layer that combines an exponential decay factor exp(−|x|/0.1) with a softsign mapping of the intermediate modulated signal.

13. Add a small constant offset of 1e-6 for numerical stability.

14. Compress the final blended signal by raising it to a fixed exponent E (use E = 0.92).

15. Define the final nonlinear transformation as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (combined mandatory components from the power-log blend with delta) × (product of all modulation factors—including the extra blending layer with softplus (or ReLU-like) and the exponential decay–softsign modulation) + 1e-6 ]^(E) }.

16. Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

17. Convert U to an acceptance probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

Remember to use exactly three learnable parameters with these bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling factor) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Encourage out-of-the-box thinking in layering these nonlinear processes to further improve prediction accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery correlations.
