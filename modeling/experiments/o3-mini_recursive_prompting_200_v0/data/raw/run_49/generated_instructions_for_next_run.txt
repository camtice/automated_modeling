For run 50, update the nonlinear transformation to further improve overall performance. In this run, experiment with replacing the softplus transformation with a ReLU-like operation (i.e., using max(0, x) or an adaptive variant) to compress extreme values more sharply. Also, add an additional multiplicative modulation layer that blends the intermediate signal with both an exponential decay factor and its softsign value, potentially with an adjustable decay constant k = 0.1. Continue to use the same structure for computing the normalized offer, fair share, fairness gap F, and scaling by phi, but encourage innovative layering of the nonlinear components. Slightly adjust the phase-shift constants in all the sinusoidal modulation factors by adding 0.005 to each (e.g., use sin(|x|+0.04) and cos(|x|+0.065)). Ensure you retain exactly three learnable parameters—beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]—and use these only. This updated instruction invites out-of-the-box ideas on how to interweave ReLU-like behavior and additional multiplicative modulations to boost prediction accuracy, lower BIC, and improve parameter recovery correlations.

For run 50, please develop an innovative computational model for responder decision-making with the following instructions:

1. Compute the normalized offer:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.

2. Compute the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

3. Define the fairness gap:
  F = N_offer − N_share.

4. Scale the fairness gap by the learnable parameter phi (with bounds [0.5, 1.5]):
  x = F / phi.

5. For the absolute value |x|, compute the core nonlinear components:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × |x|)
  • 0.2 × atan(1.1 × |x|)
  • 0.1 × (1 − exp(−|x|))
  • 0.05 × (1 − exp(−2 × |x|))
  • 0.03 × tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × |x|)
  • 0.012 × (1 − cos(0.3 × |x|))
  • 0.005 × exp(−|x|)
  Optionally include extra terms such as 0.005 × sin(2.2 × |x|) and 0.002 × cos(3.0 × |x|).

6. Sum all computed terms and add a constant delta = 0.01.

7. Modulate the sum with a factor [1 + 0.012 × sin(|x| + 0.04)] (with phase shifts adjusted).

8. Form an Intermediate_Signal by multiplying the power-law term with the logarithmic term and then adding the remaining nonlinear components (atan, exponential, tanh, and additional sinusoidal terms).

9. Multiply the Intermediate_Signal by a fixed constant C (choose a value in the range [1.05, 1.10]).

10. Apply sequential modulation stages with slight phase modifications:
  a. Multiply by [1 + 0.008 × cos(|x| + 0.06)].
  b. Multiply by [1 + 0.005 × sin(|x| + 0.11)].
  c. Multiply by [1 + 0.004 × cos(|x| + 0.08)].
  d. Multiply by [1 + 0.006 × (sin(|x| + 0.03) × cos(|x| + 0.05))].
  e. Optionally, multiply by [1 + 0.003 × (sin(|x| + 0.025) × cos(|x| + 0.045))].

11. Introduce an extra nonlinear blending layer by applying a ReLU-like transformation (e.g., f_relu(z) = max(0, z)) to the modulated signal, compressing extreme values in an alternative fashion to softplus.

12. Further blend the resulting signal with an extra multiplicative layer that combines:
  • An exponential decay factor, exp(−|x|/0.1), and
  • A softsign mapping of the intermediate modulated signal.
Multiply these factors together to form a combined modulation.

13. Add a small constant offset of 1e-6 for numerical stability.

14. Compress the final blended signal by raising it to a fixed exponent E (use E = 0.92).

15. Define the final nonlinear transformation as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (combined mandatory components from the power-log blend with delta) × (product of all modulation factors—including the ReLU-like blending and the exponential decay–softsign modulation) + 1e-6 ]^(E) }.

16. Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

17. Convert U to an acceptance probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

Remember, exactly three learnable parameters are allowed:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling factor) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Encourage out-of-the-box thinking in layering these nonlinear processes to push the boundaries in prediction accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery correlations.
