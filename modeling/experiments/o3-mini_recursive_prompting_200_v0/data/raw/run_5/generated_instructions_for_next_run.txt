For run 6, we want to push the modeling approach further by encouraging creative yet interpretable modifications. In addition to the standard power transformation (sgn(x) × |x|^0.5) on the normalized fairness gap, consider the possibility of including an offset in the fairness gap calculation to account for potential baseline discrepancies or numerical instabilities (for example, when values are close to zero). While the core structure remains similar, this run should encourage exploration of non‑obvious adjustments in the transformation stage to improve parameter recovery and overall accuracy. Emphasize that the normalized fairness gap is calculated as the difference between the offer percentage (split_self/combined_earning) and the expected fair share percentage (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)). Each learnable parameter must have explicit finite bounds (beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]). The utility is then derived as U = beta + gamma × f((normalized_fairness_gap)/phi), where f(·) is defined as sgn(x) × |x|^0.5 but can optionally include an offset term if justified. The final probability is computed by applying a logistic transform (with temperature 1), p_accept = 1/(1+exp(–U)). Clearly encapsulate the mathematical formula between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags and provide all variable descriptions in a detailed JSON format between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

For run 6 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making that:

1. Computes the normalized offer as split_self/combined_earning and the normalized fair share as token_self/(token_self+token_opp), both expressed as percentages.
2. Calculates the fairness gap as: normalized_fairness_gap = (split_self/combined_earning) - (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)).
3. Optionally allows for an additive offset in the fairness gap for numerical stability if needed.
4. Applies a power transformation to the (optionally offset) normalized fairness gap to capture diminishing sensitivity. Specifically, use f(x) = sgn(x) × |x|^0.5.
5. Introduces three learnable parameters with explicit finite bounds:
   • A baseline bias parameter (beta) bounded between -10 and 10.
   • A sensitivity parameter (gamma) bounded between 0 and 10.
   • A scaling parameter (phi) bounded between 0.5 and 1.5 that standardizes the fairness gap before transformation.
6. Defines the latent utility as:
   U = beta + gamma × f((normalized_fairness_gap)/phi)
   (You may incorporate an additive offset in the fairness gap if this aids in ensuring numerical stability or improved parameter recovery.)
7. Converts the latent utility to a probability using the logistic function:
   p_accept = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
8. Provides the complete mathematical model between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags and the detailed variable descriptions (in JSON format) between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags. Every variable, trial input, and learnable parameter with its bounds must be clearly defined and connected to the observable trial data.
9. Ensure that the formulation is concise, clear, and encourages innovative adjustments to improve model accuracy, BIC, and parameter recovery.

Be creative and consider out-of-the-box modifications in the transformation if they can yield better performance while maintaining interpretability.
