For run 51, I will maintain the same basic structure but further encourage creativity in the nonlinear blending. I will emphasize using an adaptive ReLU-like operation (for example, a capped ReLU or one with a dynamic threshold based on the magnitude of the input), and I will introduce an additional modulation layer that uses a combined exponential decay and softsign mapping, explicitly suggesting that the decay constant remain fixed (k = 0.1) but that the model consider nonlinearly blending the modulated signal with its own adaptive capped activation. I will also encourage the use of slight alterations in the phase shifts (by adding 0.005) for all sine and cosine modulation factors. The instructions for the final nonlinearity f(x) should clearly state that the signal is generated by taking the product of the core power-log blend (plus delta), the sequential modulations, the new adaptive ReLU-like compression, and then an extra modulation that multiplies an exponential decay with the softsign of the intermediate signal. Finally, the transformed signal is raised to exponent E = 0.92, and used in the latent utility U = beta + gamma×f(x). I must retain exactly three learnable parameters: beta, gamma, and phi with their fixed bounds.

For run 51, please develop an innovative computational model for responder decision-making using the following instructions:

1. Compute the normalized offer:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.
2. Compute the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).
3. Define the fairness gap:
  F = N_offer − N_share.
4. Scale the fairness gap by the learnable parameter phi (with bounds [0.5, 1.5]):
  x = F / phi.
5. For the absolute value |x|, compute the following core nonlinear components:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × |x|)
  • 0.2 × arctan(1.1 × |x|)
  • 0.1 × (1 − exp(−|x|))
  • 0.05 × (1 − exp(−2 × |x|))
  • 0.03 × tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × |x|)
  • 0.012 × (1 − cos(0.3 × |x|))
  • 0.005 × exp(−|x|)
  Optionally, include extra terms such as 0.005 × sin(2.2 × |x|) and 0.002 × cos(3.0 × |x|).
6. Sum all computed terms and add a constant delta = 0.01.
7. Modulate this sum with the factor [1 + 0.012 × sin(|x| + 0.04)] (note the phase shift adjustment).
8. Form the Intermediate_Signal by combining the product of the power-law and the logarithmic terms with the additive nonlinear components (arctan, exponential, tanh, and additional sinusoidal terms).
9. Multiply the Intermediate_Signal by a fixed constant C (choose a value in [1.05, 1.10], e.g., 1.08).
10. Apply sequential modulation stages with the following slight phase modifications:
  a. Multiply by [1 + 0.008 × cos(|x| + 0.06)].
  b. Multiply by [1 + 0.005 × sin(|x| + 0.11)].
  c. Multiply by [1 + 0.004 × cos(|x| + 0.08)].
  d. Multiply by [1 + 0.006 × (sin(|x| + 0.03) × cos(|x| + 0.05))].
  e. Optionally, multiply by [1 + 0.003 × (sin(|x| + 0.025) × cos(|x| + 0.045))].
11. Introduce an extra nonlinear blending layer by applying an adaptive ReLU-like transformation (for example, f_relu(z) = max(0, z) with a dynamic cap based on the magnitude of z) to the modulated signal, thereby sharply compressing extreme values.
12. Further blend this signal via an extra multiplicative modulation that multiplies:
  • An exponential decay factor, exp(−|x|/0.1), with
  • A softsign mapping of the intermediate modulated signal (softsign(z) = z/(1+|z|)).
Combine these two factors to create a composite modulation.
13. Add a small constant offset of 1e-6 for numerical stability.
14. Compress the final blended signal by raising it to a fixed exponent E, with E = 0.92.
15. Define the final nonlinear transformation as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (combined mandatory nonlinear components from the power-log blend plus delta) × (product of all modulation factors – including sequential modulations, the adaptive ReLU-like compression, and the extra exponential–softsign blend) + 1e-6 ]^(E) }.
16. Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).
17. Convert U to an acceptance probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

Remember, exactly three learnable parameters are allowed:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling factor) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Encourage creative and out-of-the-box methods in designing the nonlinear blending layers to achieve improved prediction accuracy, lower BIC, and enhanced parameter recovery correlations.
