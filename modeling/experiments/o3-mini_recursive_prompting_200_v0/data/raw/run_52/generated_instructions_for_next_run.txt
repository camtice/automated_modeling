For run 53, we want to push the envelope further by experimenting with more dynamic nonlinear blending stages. In this version, in addition to the previous modulation and adaptive ReLU functions, we will blend in an extra stage that incorporates a leaky modification—allowing a small gradient even for negative signals—and an additional adaptive sine-based modulation based on the reciprocal of the signal magnitude. Also, we tweak all phase offsets once more by adding an extra 0.005 to each previous phase shift (so that, for example, sin(a + 0.04) becomes sin(a + 0.045), cos(a + 0.06) becomes cos(a + 0.065), etc.). Finally, rather than using a simple f_relu(z) = min(max(0,z), 1+ln(1+z)), consider a hybrid adaptive function that smoothly transitions from a leaky behavior to a capped behavior for larger inputs. The idea is to let the model capture a wider dynamic range while preventing extreme outputs. Retain the structure with exactly three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi) with bounds beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. The goal is to increase overall predictive accuracy, lower the BIC, and enhance robust parameter recovery.

For run 53, please develop an innovative computational model for responder decision-making as follows:

1. Compute the normalized offer:  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.
2. Compute the normalized fair share:  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).
3. Define the fairness gap:  F = N_offer − N_share.
4. Scale the gap by the learnable scaling factor phi (ϕ ∈ [0.5, 1.5]):  x = F / phi.
5. Let a = |x|. Compute the following core nonlinear components:
  • a^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × a)
  • 0.2 × arctan(1.1 × a)
  • 0.1 × (1 − exp(−a))
  • 0.05 × (1 − exp(−2 × a))
  • 0.03 × tanh(a)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × a)
  • 0.012 × (1 − cos(0.3 × a))
  • 0.005 × exp(−a)
  • Optionally, include 0.005 × sin(2.2 × a) and 0.002 × cos(3.0 × a).
6. Sum these terms and add a constant delta = 0.01.
7. Modulate the sum with the factor [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)] (note the phase shift increased by 0.005).
8. Form an Intermediate_Signal by combining the multiplicative (power-law × logarithmic) and additive nonlinear components.
9. Multiply the Intermediate_Signal by a fixed constant C (set C = 1.08).
10. Apply sequential modulation stages with updated phase shifts:
  a. Multiply by [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)].
  b. Multiply by [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)].
  c. Multiply by [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)].
  d. Multiply by [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))].
  e. Optionally, multiply by [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))].
11. Introduce an adaptive ReLU-like transformation that is sensitive to the signal’s magnitude. For example, define f_adapt(z) = { if z < 0 then 0.01×z (a leaky behavior) else min(z, 1 + ln(1 + z)) } so that for small negative inputs the function leaks a small portion while capping large positive values on a logarithmic scale.
12. Further blend the signal using an extra modulation layer that multiplies by a composite factor; this factor is the product of:
  • An exponential decay: exp(−a/0.1)
  • A softsign function: softsign(z) = z/(1 + |z|) of the intermediate modulated signal.
13. Add a small constant offset of 1e-6 for numerical stability.
14. Compress the final blended signal by raising it to the fixed exponent E = 0.92.
15. Define the final nonlinear transformation as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (core nonlinear sum + delta) × (product of the sequential modulations with updated phase shifts, the adaptive ReLU-like output f_adapt, and the extra exponential–softsign composite factor) + 1e-6 ]^(0.92) }.
16. Compute the latent utility as:  U = beta + gamma × f(x).
17. Convert U to an acceptance probability using the logistic function:  p_accept = 1/(1 + exp(−U)).

Maintain exactly three learnable parameters:
  • beta ∈ [–10, 10];
  • gamma ∈ [0, 10];
  • phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Encourage creative and out-of-the-box integration of these nonlinear blending and transformation stages (including alternative adaptive activation designs) to improve predictive accuracy, reduce BIC, and ensure robust parameter recovery.
