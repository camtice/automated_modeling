For run 55, maintain the core structure of the previous nonlinear blending strategy but push the creativity further by encouraging the inclusion of an additional adaptive modulation stage. In this new version, in addition to the established extra adaptive sine modulation based on 1/(1+a), incorporate an extra multiplicative factor that uses a smooth nonlinear function such as a logistic or hyperbolic tangent transformation of the reciprocal (e.g., tanh(1/(1+a))) to further control sensitivity at extreme gap values. Also, encourage exploring additional subtle offsets or damping factors to improve the calibration of negative signals, perhaps by introducing a tiny learnable constant (within a fixed range) or a multiplicative bias term that enhances recovery and reduces overfitting. Retain exactly three learnable parameters (beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]) and ensure that all components are robust to small and very large fairness gap signals, while promoting smooth transitions in the nonlinear blending stages.

Develop your computational model for responder decision-making as follows:

1. Compute the normalized offer:  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.
2. Compute the normalized fair share:  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).
3. Define the fairness gap:  F = N_offer − N_share.
4. Scale the gap by the learnable scaling factor phi (ϕ ∈ [0.5, 1.5]):  x = F / phi.
5. Let a = |x|. Compute the following core nonlinear components:
  • a^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × a)
  • 0.2 × arctan(1.1 × a)
  • 0.1 × (1 − exp(−a))
  • 0.05 × (1 − exp(−2 × a))
  • 0.03 × tanh(a)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × a)
  • 0.012 × (1 − cos(0.3 × a))
  • 0.005 × exp(−a)
  • 0.005 × sin(2.2 × a)
  • 0.002 × cos(3.0 × a)
6. Sum these terms and add a constant delta = 0.01.
7. Modulate this sum with the factor [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)].
8. Form an Intermediate_Signal from the sum.
9. Multiply the Intermediate_Signal by a fixed constant C (set C = 1.08).
10. Apply sequential modulation stages with updated phase shifts:
  a. Multiply by [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)].
  b. Multiply by [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)].
  c. Multiply by [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)].
  d. Multiply by [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))].
  e. Multiply by [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))].
11. Introduce a hybrid adaptive ReLU-like transformation that is leaky for negative signals:
  Define f_adapt(z) = { if z < 0 then 0.01 × z, else min(z, 1 + ln(1 + z)) }.
12. Further blend the signal by multiplying by an extra composite factor, the product of:
  • An exponential decay: exp(−a/0.1),
  • A softsign transformation: softsign(z) = z/(1 + |z|),
  • An adaptive sine-based modulation: [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1+a))],
  • And an additional nonlinear damping factor such as tanh(1/(1+a)) for extra smoothness.
13. Add a small constant offset of 1e-6 for numerical stability.
14. Compress the final blended signal by raising it to the fixed exponent E = 0.92.
15. Define the final nonlinear transformation as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (core nonlinear sum + delta) × (product of all sequential modulations, the adaptive ReLU-like output f_adapt, the extra exponential–softsign factor, the reciprocal-based sine modulation, and the additional tanh(1/(1+a)) damping) + 1e-6 ]^(0.92) }.
16. Compute the latent utility:  U = beta + gamma × f(x).
17. Convert U to an acceptance probability using the logistic function:  p_accept = 1/(1 + exp(−U)).

Maintain exactly three learnable parameters:
  • beta ∈ [–10, 10];
  • gamma ∈ [0, 10];
  • phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Encourage creative, out-of-the-box integration of these dynamic nonlinear blending stages (including the extra reciprocal-based damping modulation) to enhance predictive accuracy, lower BIC, and improve robust parameter recovery.
