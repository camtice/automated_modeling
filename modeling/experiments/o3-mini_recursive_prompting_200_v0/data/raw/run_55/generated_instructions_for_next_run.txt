For run 56, the goal is to further improve accuracy, lower BIC, and boost parameter recovery. Retain exactly three learnable parameters (beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]). Maintain the core structure but now add an additional multiplicative modulation stage that leverages a smooth nonlinear damping function—such as tanh(1/(1+a))—applied to the reciprocal of (1+a) to better control extreme gap signals. Also, include a tiny learnable offset term (with fixed bounds) in the extra blending stage to help stabilize negative signals and prevent overfitting. Encourage creative integration of these additional modulation stages along with the existing adaptive ReLU-like transformation, extra sine-based reciprocal modulation, and exponential decay. Overall, the model should be robust across all gap sizes, enhance smooth transitions, and adapt its sensitivity dynamically to extreme fairness gap values.

For run 56 of 200, please design a computational model for responder decision‐making as follows:

1. Calculate the normalized offer:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.
2. Calculate the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).
3. Define the fairness gap:
  F = N_offer – N_share.
4. Scale the gap by phi (ϕ ∈ [0.5, 1.5]):
  x = F / phi.
5. Let a = |x|, and compute the following core nonlinear components:
  • a^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × a)
  • 0.2 × arctan(1.1 × a)
  • 0.1 × (1 − exp(−a))
  • 0.05 × (1 − exp(−2 × a))
  • 0.03 × tanh(a)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × a)
  • 0.012 × (1 − cos(0.3 × a))
  • 0.005 × exp(−a)
  • 0.005 × sin(2.2 × a)
  • 0.002 × cos(3.0 × a)
6. Sum these components and add a constant delta = 0.01.
7. Modulate this sum by the factor [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)].
8. Call the result Intermediate_Signal.
9. Multiply Intermediate_Signal by a fixed constant C = 1.08.
10. Apply sequential modulation stages with updated phase shifts:
  a. Multiply by [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)].
  b. Multiply by [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)].
  c. Multiply by [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)].
  d. Multiply by [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))].
  e. Multiply by [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))].
11. Introduce a hybrid adaptive ReLU-like transformation that is leaky for negative signals:
  Define f_adapt(z) = { if z < 0 then 0.01 × z, else min(z, 1 + ln(1 + z)) }.
  Apply this transformation to the modulated Intermediate_Signal.
12. Further blend the signal by multiplying it by an extra composite factor that is the product of:
  • An exponential decay: exp(−a/0.1),
  • A softsign transformation: softsign(z) = z/(1 + |z|),
  • An adaptive reciprocal-based sine modulation: [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1 + a))],
  • An additional nonlinear damping factor: tanh(1/(1 + a)).
13. In this stage, incorporate a tiny learnable offset term (within a fixed narrow range) as a multiplicative bias to further calibrate negative signals.
14. Add a small constant offset of 1e-6 for numerical stability.
15. Compress the final blended signal by raising it to the fixed exponent E = 0.92.
16. Define the nonlinear function f(x) as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (core nonlinear sum + delta) × (product of all sequential modulations, the adaptive ReLU-like output, the extra exponential–softsign blend, the reciprocal sine modulation, the additional tanh damping, and the extra learnable offset) + 1e-6 ]^(0.92) }.
17. Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(x).
18. Finally, convert U to an acceptance probability with the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1/(1 + exp(−U)).

Remember, the three learnable parameters are exactly:
  • beta ∈ [–10, 10]
  • gamma ∈ [0, 10]
  • phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]

Encourage innovative, out-of-the-box integration of the additional modulation stage (especially the use of tanh(1/(1+a)) and the extra learnable offset) to enhance overall predictive accuracy, lower BIC, and improve robust parameter recovery.

Be creative when combining these dynamic nonlinear blending stages, ensuring smooth transitions across gap values and robust performance for both small and extreme fairness gap signals.
