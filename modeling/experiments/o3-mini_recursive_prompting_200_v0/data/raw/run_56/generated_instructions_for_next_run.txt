In this new run, we want to further improve the model’s accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery. Continue using exactly three learnable parameters (beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]). Retain the core structure where the fairness gap is normalized and transformed through a series of fixed nonlinear components and sequential modulations. Now, add an additional modulation stage that includes a squared tanh damping function—such as [tanh(1/(1+a))]^2—in the product stage to further smooth extreme gap values. Also, integrate an extra learnable multiplicative offset term (within a very narrow fixed range, e.g. [0.999, 1.001]) into the extra blending stage to help stabilize negative signals and prevent overfitting. Encourage creativity beyond the obvious by suggesting that alternative nonlinear functions (for example, a logistic function or softplus variant applied to 1/(1+a)) could also be considered for controlling signal extremes. The goal is to ensure that the overall transformation is robust over the entire range of a, with smooth transitions even when a is very small or very large. Do not include details from previous interactions—simply state the new instructions clearly.

For run 57 of 200, please design a computational model for responder decision‐making as follows:
1. Calculate the normalized offer:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.
2. Calculate the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).
3. Define the fairness gap:
  F = N_offer – N_share.
4. Scale the gap by phi (ϕ ∈ [0.5, 1.5]):
  x = F / phi.
5. Let a = |x|, and compute the following core nonlinear components:
  • a^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × a)
  • 0.2 × arctan(1.1 × a)
  • 0.1 × (1 − exp(−a))
  • 0.05 × (1 − exp(−2 × a))
  • 0.03 × tanh(a)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × a)
  • 0.012 × (1 − cos(0.3 × a))
  • 0.005 × exp(−a)
  • 0.005 × sin(2.2 × a)
  • 0.002 × cos(3.0 × a)
6. Sum these components and add a constant delta = 0.01.
7. Modulate this sum by [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)] to produce an Intermediate_Signal.
8. Multiply Intermediate_Signal by the fixed constant C = 1.08.
9. Sequentially modulate the result with updated phase shifts:
  a. Multiply by [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)].
  b. Multiply by [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)].
  c. Multiply by [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)].
  d. Multiply by [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))].
  e. Multiply by [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))].
10. Apply a hybrid adaptive ReLU-like transformation defined as:
  f_adapt(z) = { if z < 0 then 0.01×z, else min(z, 1+ln(1+z)) }.
  Apply f_adapt to the modulated Intermediate_Signal.
11. Further blend the signal by multiplying it by a composite factor that is the product of:
  • Exponential decay: exp(−a/0.1),
  • A softsign transformation: softsign(z) = z/(1+|z|),
  • An adaptive reciprocal sine modulation: [1+0.005×sin(1/(1+a))],
  • A nonlinear damping factor: tanh(1/(1+a)),
  • And an additional squared damping term: [tanh(1/(1+a))]^2.
12. Incorporate a tiny learnable multiplicative offset (with fixed bounds e.g. within [0.999, 1.001]) in this extra blending stage.
13. Add a constant offset of 1e-6 for numerical stability.
14. Compress the final blended signal by raising it to the exponent E = 0.92.
15. Define the nonlinear function f(x) as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (core nonlinear sum + delta) × (product of all sequential modulations, the adaptive ReLU-like output, the extra exponential–softsign blend with the squared damping and the extra learnable offset) + 1e-6 ]^(0.92) }.
16. Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(x).
17. Convert U to an acceptance probability via the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1/(1+exp(−U)).

Ensure the model retains exactly three learnable parameters: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. Encourage innovative integration of the additional modulation stage and extra learnable offset to dynamically control extreme gap signals, ensuring smooth transitions across all gap sizes and robust parameter recovery.
