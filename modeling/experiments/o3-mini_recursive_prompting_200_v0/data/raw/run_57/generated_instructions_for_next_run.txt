For run 58, instruct the model designer to retain the basic structure—calculating a normalized fairness gap, processing it with a fixed series of nonlinear components, sequential modulations, and an adaptive ReLU‐like function—but now add further innovation in the extra blending stage. Specifically, require that the extra modulation stage include not only the previously used exponential decay combined with softsign, adaptive sine modulation, tanh damping, and its squared version, but also suggest that the designer experiment with an alternative nonlinear function (for example, a softplus function applied to 1/(1+a) or even a logistic transformation) to control extreme values. Encourage reduction of potentially redundant oscillatory modulations to limit overfitting and to not overly complicate the transformation for very small or very large gap values. Also stress that the new instructions must integrate the extra learnable multiplicative offset (with bounds [0.999, 1.001]) in the extra blending stage, and promote smooth transitions across the entire gap range.
Make sure that exactly three learnable parameters are maintained (beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]). Ask for clear step‐by‐step instructions that target improved accuracy, lower BIC, and enhanced parameter recovery.

For run 58 of 200, please design a computational model for responder decision‐making as follows:

1. Compute the normalized offer as:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.
2. Compute the normalized fair share as:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).
3. Define the fairness gap:
  F = N_offer – N_share.
4. Scale the gap via the normalization parameter phi (ϕ ∈ [0.5, 1.5]):
  x = F / phi.
5. Let a = |x| and compute the core nonlinear components:
  • a^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × a)
  • 0.2 × arctan(1.1 × a)
  • 0.1 × [1 − exp(−a)]
  • 0.05 × [1 − exp(−2 × a)]
  • 0.03 × tanh(a)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × a)
  • 0.012 × [1 − cos(0.3 × a)]
  • 0.005 × exp(−a)
  • 0.005 × sin(2.2 × a)
  • 0.002 × cos(3.0 × a)
6. Sum these components and add a constant delta = 0.01.
7. Modulate the sum by multiplying by [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)] to obtain an Intermediate_Signal.
8. Multiply Intermediate_Signal by the fixed constant C = 1.08.
9. Sequentially modulate the result with updated phase shifts:
  a. Multiply by [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)].
  b. Multiply by [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)].
  c. Multiply by [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)].
  d. Multiply by [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))].
  e. Multiply by [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))].
10. Apply a hybrid adaptive ReLU-like function defined by:
  f_adapt(z) = { if z < 0 then 0.01×z, else min(z, 1 + ln(1+z)) }.
  Apply f_adapt to the modulated Intermediate_Signal.
11. Further blend the signal by multiplying it by a composite factor consisting of:
  • Exponential decay: exp(−a/0.1),
  • A softsign transformation: softsign(z) = z/(1 + |z|),
  • An adaptive reciprocal sine modulation: [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1 + a))],
  • A damping factor: tanh(1/(1 + a)),
  • A squared damping term: [tanh(1/(1 + a))]^2,
  and additionally experiment with an alternative nonlinearity (e.g., apply a softplus or logistic function to 1/(1 + a)) to control extremes.
12. Multiply the composite factor by an extra learnable multiplicative offset (offset_factor) with fixed bounds [0.999, 1.001].
13. Add a constant offset of 1e-6 for numerical stability.
14. Compress the final blended signal by raising it to the exponent E = 0.92.
15. Define the nonlinear function f(x) as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (core nonlinear sum + delta) × (the product of all sequential modulations, the adaptive ReLU-like output, and the extra blending stage (including the extra nonlinearity and offset_factor)]^(0.92) }.
16. Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(x).
17. Map U to an acceptance probability via the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

Ensure your model retains exactly three learnable parameters: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. Strive for innovative integration of the additional modulation stage and extra learnable offset to dynamically control extreme values of a, ensuring smooth transitions over all gap sizes and robust parameter recovery. Consider out-of-the-box alternatives (such as softplus or logistic approximations) for further controlling signal extremes without overcomplicating the model.
