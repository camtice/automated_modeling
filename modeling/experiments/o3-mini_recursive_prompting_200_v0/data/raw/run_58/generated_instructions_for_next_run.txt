For run 59, instruct the model designer to build on the previous design but streamline the extra blending stage by reducing redundant oscillatory modulations and incorporating a softplus transformation applied to 1/(1+a) as an alternative nonlinearity to better control extreme values. Emphasize that the composite factor in step 11 should now include this softplus alternative along with the exponential decay and softsign, and remove the squared tanh damping. Also, clarify that exactly three learnable parameters must be maintained (beta within [–10, 10], gamma within [0, 10], and phi within [0.5, 1.5]) and that the extra learnable multiplicative offset (with bounds [0.999, 1.001]) should be integrated as a fixed offset to enforce smooth transitions. In summary, encourage out‐of‐the‐box thinking by suggesting experimentation with the softplus/logistic transformation in the extra blending stage while simplifying the sequential modulation to avoid overfitting.

For run 59 of 200, please design a computational model for responder decision‐making as follows:

1. Compute the normalized offer:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.
2. Compute the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).
3. Define the fairness gap:
  F = N_offer – N_share.
4. Scale the gap by the normalization parameter phi (ϕ ∈ [0.5, 1.5]):
  x = F / phi.
5. Let a = |x| and compute the core nonlinear components:
  • a^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × a)
  • 0.2 × arctan(1.1 × a)
  • 0.1 × [1 − exp(−a)]
  • 0.05 × [1 − exp(−2 × a)]
  • 0.03 × tanh(a)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × a)
  • 0.012 × [1 − cos(0.3 × a)]
  • 0.005 × exp(−a)
  • 0.005 × sin(2.2 × a)
  • 0.002 × cos(3.0 × a)
6. Sum these components and add a constant delta = 0.01.
7. Modulate the sum by multiplying by [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)] to obtain an Intermediate_Signal.
8. Multiply Intermediate_Signal by the fixed constant C = 1.08.
9. Sequentially modulate the result with updated phase shifts:
  a. Multiply by [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)].
  b. Multiply by [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)].
  c. Multiply by [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)].
  d. Multiply by [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))].
  e. Multiply by [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))].
10. Apply the hybrid adaptive ReLU‐like function defined as:
  f_adapt(z) = { if z < 0 then 0.01 × z, else min(z, 1 + ln(1 + z)) }.
  Apply f_adapt to the modulated Intermediate_Signal.
11. Further blend the signal by multiplying by a composite factor that includes:
  • Exponential decay: exp(−a / 0.1),
  • A softsign transformation: softsign(z) = z / (1 + |z|),
  • An adaptive reciprocal sine modulation: [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1 + a))],
  • A damping factor: tanh(1/(1 + a)),
  • An alternative nonlinearity: apply the softplus function (softplus(z) = ln(1 + exp(z))) to 1/(1 + a).
12. Multiply the resulting composite factor by an extra learnable multiplicative offset, offset_factor, with fixed bounds [0.999, 1.001].
13. Add a constant offset of 1e-6 for numerical stability.
14. Compress the final blended signal by raising it to the exponent E = 0.92.
15. Define the nonlinear function f(x) as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [C × (core nonlinear sum + delta) × (the product of all sequential modulations, the adaptive ReLU-like output, and the extra blending stage (including the composite factor with softplus nonlinearity and offset_factor)]^(0.92) }.
16. Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(x).
17. Map U to an acceptance probability via the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

Ensure your model retains exactly three learnable parameters: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. Strongly encourage innovative integration of the extra blending stage with the alternative softplus transformation to control extreme a values and smooth transitions across gap sizes, while reducing redundant oscillatory modulations to improve accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery.
