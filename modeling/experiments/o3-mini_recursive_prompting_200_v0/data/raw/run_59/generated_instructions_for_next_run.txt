For run 60, instruct the model designer to streamline the extra blending stage by removing redundant oscillatory modulations and replacing the squared tanh damping with a simpler softplus-based adjustment applied to 1/(1+a). Emphasize that the composite factor in step 11 must now combine an exponential decay, a softsign transformation, the adaptive reciprocal sine modulation, and—importantly—the softplus alternative, in order to better tame extreme values and achieve smooth transitions. Require that exactly three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, and phi) are maintained with beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. Also, specify that the extra multiplicative offset is fixed (with bounds [0.999, 1.001]) and should simply be multiplied as a constant in the composite factor. Encourage creative and out‐of‐the‐box modifications while keeping the model as parsimonious as possible to improve overall accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery.

For run 60 of 200, please design a computational model for responder decision‐making as follows:

1. Compute the normalized offer:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.
2. Compute the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).
3. Define the fairness gap:
  F = N_offer – N_share.
4. Scale the gap by the normalization parameter phi (ϕ ∈ [0.5, 1.5]):
  x = F / phi.
5. Let a = |x| and compute the core nonlinear components:
  • a^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × a)
  • 0.2 × arctan(1.1 × a)
  • 0.1 × [1 − exp(−a)]
  • 0.05 × [1 − exp(−2 × a)]
  • 0.03 × tanh(a)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × a)
  • 0.012 × [1 − cos(0.3 × a)]
  • 0.005 × exp(−a)
  • 0.005 × sin(2.2 × a)
  • 0.002 × cos(3.0 × a)
6. Sum these components and add a constant delta = 0.01.
7. Modulate the aggregate by multiplying by [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)] to obtain an Intermediate_Signal.
8. Multiply Intermediate_Signal by the fixed constant C = 1.08.
9. Sequentially modulate the result with updated phase shifts:
  a. Multiply by [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)].
  b. Multiply by [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)].
  c. Multiply by [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)].
  d. Multiply by [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))].
  e. Multiply by [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))].
10. Apply the hybrid adaptive ReLU‐like function defined as:
  f_adapt(z) = { if z < 0 then 0.01 × z, else min(z, 1 + ln(1 + z)) }.
  Apply this function to the sequentially modulated Intermediate_Signal.
11. Further blend the signal by multiplying by a composite factor that includes:
  • Exponential decay: exp(−a / 0.1),
  • A softsign transformation: softsign(z) = z / (1 + |z|),
  • An adaptive reciprocal sine modulation: [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1 + a))],
  • A damping factor: tanh(1/(1 + a)),
  • An alternative nonlinearity: apply the softplus function (softplus(z) = ln(1 + exp(z))) to 1/(1 + a).
12. Multiply the resulting composite factor by a fixed extra multiplicative offset (offset_factor), which is set to 1.0 (with bounds [0.999, 1.001]).
13. Add a constant offset of 1e-6 for numerical stability.
14. Compress the final blended signal by raising it to the exponent E = 0.92.
15. Define the nonlinear function f(x) as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [C × (core nonlinear sum + delta) × (the product of all sequential modulations, the adaptive ReLU output, and the extra blending stage (including the composite factor with the softplus alternative)]^(0.92) }.
16. Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(x).
17. Map U to an acceptance probability via the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

Remember, your model must retain exactly three learnable parameters:
  beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Encourage out‐of‐the‐box thinking in your design—experiment with the softplus transformation in the blending stage while simplifying the sequential modulations to avoid overfitting, and ensure that the extra blending stage effectively controls extreme gap values to improve accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery.
