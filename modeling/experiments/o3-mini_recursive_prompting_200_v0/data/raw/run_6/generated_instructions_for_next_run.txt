For run 7, we want to encourage innovative adjustments in the transformation stage to boost accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery. In previous runs, the basic sign–power transformation (sgn(x) × |x|^0.5) with an optional additive offset was used, but its parameter recovery for gamma and phi was suboptimal. In this run, instruct the model to experiment with alternative, interpretable nonlinear transformations. For instance, consider combining a power transformation with a logarithmic term (or a hybrid function) to better capture diminishing sensitivity, especially when the fairness gap is near zero. You may allow an optional additive offset in the fairness gap for numerical stability. Maintain the core structure where the normalized fairness gap is calculated as the difference between the offer percentage (split_self/combined_earning) and the fair share percentage (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)). Emphasize that exactly three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi) must have explicit bounds: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. Be creative: encourage exploring modifications such as adaptive smoothing near zero or an alternative transformation function f(·) that still retains interpretability. The final latent utility should be defined as U = beta + gamma × f((normalized_fairness_gap)/phi), and the probability is computed using a logistic transform: p_accept = 1/(1 + exp(–U)). When specifying the model, clearly encapsulate the mathematical formula between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags and provide detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags. Define the target variable within <target_variable> tags (set as "accept"). Ensure your instructions are mathematically succinct, clear, and promote out-of-the-box thinking while explicitly linking each learnable parameter and trial input to the dataset.

For run 7 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making that:

1. Computes the normalized offer percentage as split_self/combined_earning and the normalized fair share percentage as token_self/(token_self+token_opp).
2. Calculates the fairness gap as: normalized_fairness_gap = (split_self/combined_earning) - (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)).
3. Optionally incorporates an additive offset (delta) in the fairness gap to improve numerical stability.
4. Applies a nonlinear transformation to the (optionally offset) normalized fairness gap to capture diminishing sensitivity. Besides the traditional f(x) = sgn(x) × |x|^0.5, consider innovative alternatives (e.g., combining a power function with a logarithmic term or adaptive smoothing when values are close to zero) that remain interpretable.
5. Uses exactly three learnable parameters with explicit finite bounds: a baseline bias parameter beta ∈ [–10, 10], a sensitivity parameter gamma ∈ [0, 10], and a scaling parameter phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. (If you include an offset delta for enhanced stability, specify its finite bounds as well.)
6. Defines the latent utility as:
   U = beta + gamma × f((normalized_fairness_gap)/phi)
   where f(·) is your chosen transformation function.
7. Converts the latent utility into a choice probability via the logistic function:
   p_accept = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
8. Provides a complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and detailed variable descriptions in JSON format between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags. Clearly indicate the predicted target variable in <target_variable> tags (set to accept).
9. Keep the formulation concise and mathematically precise, encouraging creative, out-of-the-box modifications that improve overall model performance, BIC, and parameter recovery.
