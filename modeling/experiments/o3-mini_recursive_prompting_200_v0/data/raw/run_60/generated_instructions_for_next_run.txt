For this next run, simplify the extra blending stage by removing redundant oscillatory modulations altogether and replacing the squared tanh damping with a single softplus adjustment on 1/(1+a). Keep the sequential modulation steps as specified but streamline them if possible to avoid overfitting. Emphasize that the composite blending factor in step 11 must now simply combine the exponential decay, a softsign transformation, the adaptive reciprocal sine modulation, and the softplus alternative on 1/(1+a). Retain exactly three learnable parameters with the specified bounds—beta in [–10, 10], gamma in [0, 10], and phi in [0.5, 1.5]—and require that the extra multiplicative offset factor remains fixed at 1.0 (within bounds [0.999, 1.001]). Encourage creative, out‐of‐the‐box approaches while maintaining parsimony to improve accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery.

N_offer = split_self / combined_earning  
N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp)  
F = N_offer – N_share  
x = F / phi  
a = |x|  

Compute the core nonlinear components using:
 • a^(0.5)
 • ln(1 + 3.4 × a)
 • 0.2 × arctan(1.1 × a)
 • 0.1 × [1 − exp(−a)]
 • 0.05 × [1 − exp(−2 × a)]
 • 0.03 × tanh(a)
 • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × a)
 • 0.012 × [1 − cos(0.3 × a)]
 • 0.005 × exp(−a)
 • 0.005 × sin(2.2 × a)
 • 0.002 × cos(3.0 × a)  
Sum these components and add a constant delta = 0.01.

Modulate this aggregate by multiplying by [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)] to obtain an Intermediate_Signal.

Multiply Intermediate_Signal by a fixed constant C = 1.08.

Then, sequentially modulate this result with:
 a. [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)]
 b. [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)]
 c. [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)]
 d. [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))]
 e. [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))].

Apply the hybrid adaptive ReLU‐like function defined by:
  f_adapt(z) = { if z < 0 then 0.01 × z, else min(z, 1 + ln(1 + z)) }  
to the sequentially modulated signal.

For the extra blending stage, replace the previous squared tanh damping with a composite factor that consists of:
 • Exponential decay: exp(−a / 0.1)
 • A softsign transformation: z/(1 + |z|) applied on the sequentially modulated signal
 • An adaptive reciprocal sine modulation: [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1 + a))]
 • A damping factor using the softplus alternative applied to 1/(1 + a), that is, softplus(1/(1 + a)) = ln(1 + exp(1/(1 + a))).

Multiply the composite factor by the fixed extra multiplicative offset (offset_factor) set to 1.0 (with bounds [0.999, 1.001]). Add an offset of 1e-6 for numerical stability, then compress the final blended signal by raising it to the fixed exponent E = 0.92.

Define the nonlinear function f(x) as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [C × (core nonlinear sum + delta) × (product of the sequential modulations, the adaptive ReLU output, and the extra blending stage as defined with the new composite factor]^(0.92) }.

Compute the latent utility U as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(x).

Finally, map U to an acceptance probability via the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

Remember, the only learnable parameters are beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. Think unconventionally while simplifying the blending stage to tame extreme values and improve overall performance (accuracy, lower BIC) and parameter recovery.
