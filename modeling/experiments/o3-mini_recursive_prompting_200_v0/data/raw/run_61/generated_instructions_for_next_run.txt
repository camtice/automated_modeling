For run 62 of 200, simplify the extra blending stage further. Remove any extra sine or cosine modulations that are not essential and replace the previously used squared tanh damping with a clean, single softplus transformation directly on 1/(1+a). Retain the sequential modulation steps (the five multiplicative modulations) unchanged, but instruct the model to be parsimonious in its computations to avoid overfitting. Emphasize that the composite blending factor must now simply combine:
• Exponential decay: exp(–a/0.1)
• A softsign transformation applied on the sequentially modulated signal (i.e. z/(1+|z|))
• An adaptive reciprocal sine modulation: [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1 + a))]
• And a softplus transformation on 1/(1+a), defined as ln(1 + exp(1/(1+a))).

The product of these elements (multiplied by the fixed extra offset factor of 1.0 [within 0.999–1.001] and with a small additive constant for numerical stability) should be raised to the fixed exponent 0.92. 

Retain exactly three learnable parameters—beta, gamma, and phi—with bounds beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Encourage creative, unconventional model design while staying within these constraints to improve prediction accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery. Leave ample room for out‐of‐the‐box approaches beyond the “obvious” transformations while ensuring that every computed component is used in the final utility U, which is then converted via the logistic function to yield the acceptance probability.

In your final instructions, clearly detail the following steps:
1. Compute the core nonlinear sum (using the 11 components plus a delta constant).
2. Modulate this sum by multiplying by [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)].
3. Multiply the modulated result by a fixed constant C = 1.08.
4. Sequentially modulate with the five factors:
  [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)],
  [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)],
  [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)],
  [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))],
  [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))].
5. Apply the hybrid adaptive ReLU-like function:
  f_adapt(z) = { if z < 0 then 0.01 × z, else min(z, 1 + ln(1 + z)) }.
6. Use as the extra blending stage the composite factor that now is defined as the product of:
  • exp(–a/0.1),
  • the softsign of the sequentially modulated signal,
  • [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1 + a))],
  • softplus(1/(1 + a)) = ln(1 + exp(1/(1 + a))).
Multiply this composite by the fixed offset factor (which is exactly 1.0, within bounds [0.999,1.001]), then add a small offset (1e–6), and raise the result to the fixed power 0.92.

Finally, define f(x) as the sign of x times the product (f_adapt multiplied by the extra blending outcome) raised to 0.92 and compute U = beta + gamma × f(x). Then map U to the acceptance probability via a logistic function.

Encourage out-of-the-box exploration within these guidelines.
