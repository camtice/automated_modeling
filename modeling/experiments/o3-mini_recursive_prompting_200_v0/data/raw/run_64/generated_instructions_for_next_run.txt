For this run, instruct the model to keep the basic structure of the previous design but with a refined extra blending stage. Emphasize the following: 
1. Compute the core nonlinear sum from the 11 fixed components plus the delta offset.
2. Multiply this sum by [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)] and then scale by the constant 1.08.
3. Sequentially modulate the result with the five multiplicative factors as before:
  • [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)]
  • [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)]
  • [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)]
  • [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))]
  • [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))]
4. Apply the hybrid adaptive ReLU-like function f_adapt(z), defined as:
  f_adapt(z) = { 0.01 × z, if z < 0; min(z, 1 + ln(1 + z)), if z ≥ 0 }.
5. For the extra blending stage, simplify by computing the composite factor as the product of:
  • exponential decay: exp(–a/0.1)
  • the softsign of the sequentially modulated signal (i.e. z/(1+|z|))
  • an adaptive reciprocal sine modulation: [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1 + a))]
  • a single softplus transformation on 1/(1+a): ln(1 + exp(1/(1+a))).
Multiply these together (times a fixed offset factor exactly 1.0, within [0.999,1.001]) and add a small constant (1e–6) for numerical stability; then raise the result to the fixed power 0.92.
6. Define the final transformed signal f(x) as the sign of z multiplied by the product (f_adapt × extra_blend) raised to 0.92.
7. Compute U = beta + gamma × f(x) and convert it to the acceptance probability using the logistic function.
Enforce exactly three learnable parameters with bounds:
  beta ∈ [–10, 10],
  gamma ∈ [0, 10],
  phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].
Encourage creative, unconventional design within these constraints while being parsimonious in computations to reduce overfitting, improve prediction accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery.

New Instructions for Run 65 of 200:
1. Compute the core nonlinear sum “a” by summing the 11 fixed components derived from task variables and adding a delta constant.
2. Multiply “a” by [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)].
3. Scale the result by the fixed constant 1.08.
4. Sequentially modulate the scaled value using the following five multiplicative factors:
  • [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)]
  • [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)]
  • [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)]
  • [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))]
  • [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))]
5. Apply a hybrid adaptive ReLU-like function defined as:
  f_adapt(z) = { 0.01 × z, if z < 0; min(z, 1 + ln(1 + z)), if z ≥ 0 }.
6. For the extra blending stage, compute the composite factor by multiplying:
  • exp(–a/0.1),
  • softsign(z) where softsign(z) = z/(1 + |z|),
  • [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1 + a))],
  • softplus(1/(1 + a)) where softplus(1/(1+a)) = ln(1 + exp(1/(1+a))).
Multiply these components together, multiply by a fixed offset factor exactly 1.0, add a small constant 1e–6 for stability, and then raise this product to the power 0.92.
7. Define f(x) as: f(x) = sign(z) × ( f_adapt(z) × [extra blending composite] )^(0.92).
8. Compute the latent utility U = beta + gamma × f(x) and map it via the logistic function to obtain p_accept.
9. Use only three learnable parameters with the following bounds:
  beta ∈ [–10, 10],
  gamma ∈ [0, 10],
  phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Encourage the model to think creatively within these guidelines while being parsimonious to avoid overfitting and to improve accuracy, BIC, and parameter recovery.
