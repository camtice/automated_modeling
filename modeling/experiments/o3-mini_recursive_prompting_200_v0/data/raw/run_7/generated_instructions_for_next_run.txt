For run 8, we want to further push the model to explore innovative and adaptive nonlinear transformations that may improve fit accuracy, lower BIC, and improve parameter recovery. In these instructions, we continue to require that exactly three learnable parameters are used (beta, gamma, phi with the given finite bounds) while allowing for an optional offset (delta) if desired. Instead of the usual sign-power transformation, encourage the exploration of a more adaptive transformation, such as a hybrid function that smoothly transitions between a power function and a logarithmic function near zero, for instance using a transformation like f(x) = sgn(x) × (|x|^0.5 + log(1 + c × |x|)) where c is a fixed constant to control the logarithmic term, or a similar variant. This function should be interpretable and differentiable. Also, stress that model inputs come from the normalized fairness gap: (split_self/combined_earning) – (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)). The final utility is computed via U = beta + gamma × f((normalized_fairness_gap)/phi), followed by a standard logistic transform to obtain p_accept.

For run 8 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making that:
1. Computes the normalized offer percentage as split_self/combined_earning and the normalized fair share percentage as token_self/(token_self+token_opp).
2. Calculates the fairness gap as normalized_fairness_gap = (split_self/combined_earning) - (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)).
3. Optionally incorporates an additive offset (delta) in the fairness gap for improved numerical stability; if included, specify its finite bounds.
4. Applies an innovative, adaptive nonlinear transformation f(·) to the (optionally offset) normalized fairness gap divided by phi. For example, you might use a hybrid function that combines a power term and a logarithmic term (e.g., f(x) = sgn(x) × (|x|^0.5 + log(1 + c×|x|))) where c is a fixed constant, or another adaptive smoothing strategy near zero.
5. Uses exactly three learnable parameters with explicit finite bounds: a baseline bias beta ∈ [–10, 10], a sensitivity parameter gamma ∈ [0, 10], and a scaling parameter phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. (If you include an offset delta, provide appropriate finite bounds.)
6. Defines the latent utility as:
   U = beta + gamma × f((normalized_fairness_gap)/phi)
7. Converts the latent utility into a choice probability using the logistic function:
   p_accept = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
8. Provides the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags. Clearly indicate the predicted target variable in <target_variable> tags (set to “accept”).
9. Keep the formulation concise, mathematically precise, and encourage creative, out-of-the-box modifications that may improve overall model performance, BIC, and parameter recovery.
