For run 76, we want to further refine the extra blending composite to improve overall performance. We will keep the structure in steps 1–6 unchanged. In step 7 (the extra blending stage), we add two new modulation components: (1) a tuned constant inside the softplus term (e.g. replacing ln(1 + exp(1/(1+a))) with ln(1 + exp(0.9/(1+a)))), and (2) an additional oscillatory damping multiplier [1 – 0.0015 × cos(2×a)] to counter any over‐amplification. Finally, we will raise the total product to a slightly updated exponent of 0.93 instead of 0.92 for extra flexibility. We also reiterate that the learnable parameters remain beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. Encourage creative and out‐of‐the‐box thinking within this refined composite to achieve better accuracy, lower BIC, and improved parameter recovery.

New Instructions for Run 76 of 200:
1. Compute the core sum “a” by summing the 11 fixed components (F1 to F11) derived from task variables and add a small constant δ.
2. Multiply “a” by [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)].
3. Scale the result by the constant 1.08.
4. Sequentially modulate the scaled value using these five factors:
  • [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)]
  • [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)]
  • [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)]
  • [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))]
  • [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))]
5. Let z denote the result after these sequential modulations.
6. Define the adaptive transformation function f_adapt(z) as:
  f_adapt(z) = { 0.01 × z if z < 0; min(z, 1 + ln(1 + z)) if z ≥ 0 }.
7. For the extra blending composite, compute:
  extra = ( exp(–a/0.1) × [z/(1 + |z|)] × [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1 + a))] × ln(1 + exp(0.9/(1 + a))) × [1 – 0.002 × cos(a)] × [1 – 0.0015 × cos(2 × a)] + 1e–6 )^(0.93).
8. Define the final transformed signal as:
  f(x) = sign(z) × ( f_adapt(z) × extra )^(0.93).
9. Compute the latent utility U = beta + gamma × f(x), then obtain the acceptance probability via the logistic function: P(accept = 1) = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
10. Use exactly three learnable parameters with these bounds:
  • beta ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Focus on ensuring that the extra blending composite is both stable and robust by incorporating the additional tuned softplus constant and oscillatory damping multiplier. Think creatively, but keep the computations efficient to improve accuracy, BIC, and parameter recovery.
