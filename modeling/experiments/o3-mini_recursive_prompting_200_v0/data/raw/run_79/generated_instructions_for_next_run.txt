For run 80, further enhance the model by incorporating a quadratic term into the dynamic thresholding of the adaptive transformation and integrating a squared hyperbolic cosine factor into the extra blending composite. Additionally, decrease the softplus constant slightly (from 0.87 to 0.865) and raise the final exponent (from 0.94 to 0.942) to allow more flexible compression. Keep the three learnable parameters exactly with the same bounds. Encourage creative and non‐obvious nonlinear modulation in the extra stages to capture subtle higher‐order nonlinearities, stabilize extreme values, and ultimately improve accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery.

New Instructions for Run 80 of 200:
1. Compute the core sum “a” as the sum of fixed components F₁ through F₁₁ plus a small constant δ.
2. Multiply “a” by [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)].
3. Scale the result by 1.08.
4. Sequentially modulate this scaled value using these factors:
  • [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)]
  • [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)]
  • [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)]
  • [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))]
  • [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))]
5. Let z denote the result after these modulations.
6. Define the adaptive transformation function f_adapt(z) as:
  f_adapt(z) = { 0.01 × z if z < 0; min(z, 1 + ln(1 + z)) if z ≥ 0 },
  then multiply it by a dynamic thresholding factor [1 + 0.0005 × a² + 0.0001 × a²] to guard against extreme values.
7. For the extra blending composite, compute:
  extra = ( exp(–a/0.1) × [z/(1 + |z|)] × [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1 + a))] × ln(1 + exp(0.865/(1 + a))) × [1 – 0.002 × cos(a)] × [1 – 0.0025 × cos(2.5 × a)] × [1 + 0.001 × a] × [1 + cosh(0.001 × a)]² + 1e–6 )^(0.942).
8. Define the final transformed signal as:
  f(x) = sign(z) × ( f_adapt(z) × extra )^(0.942).
9. Compute the latent utility: U = beta + gamma × f(x), and then calculate the acceptance probability via the logistic function: P(accept = 1) = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
10. Use exactly three learnable parameters with these bounds:
  • beta ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Encourage innovative, out‐of‐the‐box design in steps 6 and 7 to further improve accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery.
