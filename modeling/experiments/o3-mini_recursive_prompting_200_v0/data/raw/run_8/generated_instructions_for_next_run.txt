For run 9, we want to push even further on improving overall model performance, BIC, and the robustness of parameter recovery. In addition to the steps from the previous run, we suggest emphasizing a more flexible and adaptive nonlinear transformation. This transformation should smoothly capture the behavior near zero while remaining interpretable and differentiable. An example would be a hybrid function combining a power term with a logarithmic term (for example, f(x) = sgn(x) × (|x|^(0.5) + log(1 + |x|))), but feel free to adjust with a fixed scaling constant if it better captures the curvature. Additionally, consider optionally adding a stability offset (delta) to the fairness gap if it can enhance numerical behavior; if used, specify it with clear finite bounds (for instance, delta ∈ [–1, 1]). However, ensure that the core learnable parameters remain exactly three—beta, gamma, and phi. Keep the innovation in your transformation function central while ensuring that the model input is the normalized fairness gap: (split_self/combined_earning) – (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)). The final utility is defined as: U = beta + gamma × f((normalized_fairness_gap)/phi) (or f((normalized_fairness_gap + delta)/phi) if the offset is incorporated), followed by a standard logistic conversion to p_accept. The goal is to encourage out-of-the-box thinking to achieve improved accuracy, lower BIC, and better parameter recovery.

For run 9 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making with the following requirements:

1. Compute the normalized offer percentage as: 
  N_offer = split_self/combined_earning,
  and the normalized fair share as: 
  N_share = token_self/(token_self+token_opp).

2. Calculate the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer – N_share.

3. Optionally, incorporate an additive offset delta for improved numerical stability. If you include delta, constrain its bounds (e.g., delta ∈ [–1, 1]). Note that delta is optional and should not replace the requirement to have exactly three learnable parameters.

4. Apply an innovative, adaptive nonlinear transformation f(·) to the (optionally offset) fairness gap divided by phi. For instance, one candidate is:
  f(x) = sgn(x) × (|x|^(0.5) + log(1 + |x|)),
but you are encouraged to experiment with modifications (such as introducing a fixed constant multiplier within the logarithm) to achieve smoother behavior near zero and improved model performance.

5. Use exactly three learnable parameters with explicit finite bounds:
  – beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  – gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  – phi (scaling) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

6. Define the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi)                           [or U = beta + gamma × f((F + delta)/phi) if using delta].

7. Convert U into a choice probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).

8. Provide the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

9. Clearly indicate the predicted target variable in <target_variable> tags (set to “accept”).

Your goal is to leverage out-of-the-box, flexible nonlinear transformations to further enhance accuracy, reduce BIC, and improve parameter recovery in this responder decision-making task.
