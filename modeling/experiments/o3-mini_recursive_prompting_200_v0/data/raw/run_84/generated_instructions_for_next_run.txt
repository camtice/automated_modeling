For run 85, we want to push further the nonlinear modulation in the adaptive transformation and extra blending stages. In step 5, we retain the original piecewise function for f_adapt(z) but now multiply it by its dynamic threshold factor that incorporates the quadratic term [1 + 0.0005×a² + 0.0001×a²] (you might even consider additional higher‐order terms if they boost recovery). In step 6, we ensure that the extra blending composite continues to include the squared hyperbolic cosine factor (i.e. [1+cosh(0.001×a)]²) and encourage creative experimentation with that term (for instance, varying its exponent or including an additional multiplier) to further stabilize extreme values. All other steps remain the same with the final exponent set to 0.942. The three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi) remain with their specified bounds.

New Instructions for Run 85 of 200:
1. Compute the core sum “a” as the sum of fixed components F₁ through F₁₁ plus a small constant δ.
2. Multiply “a” by [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)].
3. Scale the result by 1.08.
4. Sequentially modulate this scaled value using these factors:
  • [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)]
  • [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)]
  • [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)]
  • [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))]
  • [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))]
5. Denote the result after these modulations as z.
6. Define the adaptive transformation function f_adapt(z) as:
  f_adapt(z) = { 0.01 × z if z < 0; min(z, 1 + ln(1 + z)) if z ≥ 0 },
  then multiply f_adapt(z) by a dynamic thresholding factor [1 + 0.0005 × a² + 0.0001 × a²]. (Optionally, explore including an extra higher‐order term if it further enhances stability.)
7. For the extra blending composite, compute:
  extra = ( exp(–a/0.1) × [z/(1 + |z|)] × [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1 + a))] × ln(1 + exp(0.865/(1 + a))) × [1 – 0.002 × cos(a)] × [1 – 0.0025 × cos(2.5 × a)] × [1 + 0.001 × a] × [1 + cosh(0.001 × a)]² + 1e–6 )^(0.942).
  Feel free to experiment with the squared hyperbolic cosine factor to further stabilize extreme values.
8. Define the final transformed signal as:
  f(x) = sign(z) × ( f_adapt(z) × extra )^(0.942).
9. Compute the latent utility: U = beta + gamma × f(x), and then calculate the acceptance probability via the logistic function: P(accept = 1) = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
10. Use exactly three learnable parameters with these bounds:
  • beta ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].
