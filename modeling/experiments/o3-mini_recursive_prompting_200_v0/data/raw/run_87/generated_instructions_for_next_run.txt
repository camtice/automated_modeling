For run 88, I recommend increasing the flexibility in the dynamic thresholding by adding an extra quartic term (0.000005×a⁴) to the threshold factor. In addition, we suggest keeping the extra blending composite largely the same but explicitly encouraging experimentation with slight modifications to its exponent if necessary (e.g., testing values around 0.942). Continue to use the same sequential modulation factors on the scaled core sum. Finally, reiterate that the three learnable parameters remain β, γ, and φ with bounds β ∈ [–10, 10], γ ∈ [0, 10], and φ ∈ [0.5, 1.5]; however, now encourage trying dynamic modifications (especially in the extra composite exponent and threshold factor) to capture extreme values more robustly.

New Instructions for Run 88 of 200:
1. Compute the core sum a as the sum of fixed components F₁ through F₁₁ plus a small constant δ.
2. Multiply a by [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)].
3. Scale the result by 1.08.
4. Sequentially modulate this scaled value using these factors:
  • [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)]
  • [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)]
  • [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)]
  • [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))]
  • [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))]
5. Denote the result after these modulations as z.
6. Define the adaptive transformation function f_adapt(z) as:
  f_adapt(z) = { 0.01 × z if z < 0; min(z, 1 + ln(1 + z)) if z ≥ 0 },
  then multiply f_adapt(z) by a dynamic thresholding factor [1 + 0.0005×a² + 0.00005×a³ + 0.000005×a⁴].
7. For the extra blending composite, compute:
  extra = ( exp(–a/0.1) × [z/(1 + |z|)] × [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1 + a))] × ln(1 + exp(0.865/(1 + a))) × [1 – 0.002 × cos(a)] × [1 – 0.0025 × cos(2.5×a)] × [1 + 0.001×a] × [1 + cosh(0.001×a)]^(2 + 0.0005×a) + 1e–6 )^(0.942).
  Encourage experimentation with the exponent on the hyperbolic cosine term if needed.
8. Define the final transformed signal as:
  f(x) = sign(z) × ( f_adapt(z) × extra )^(0.942).
9. Compute the latent utility: U = beta + gamma × f(x), and then obtain the acceptance probability via the logistic function: P(accept = 1) = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
10. Use exactly three learnable parameters with these bounds:
  • beta ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Experiment with the additional quartic term in the dynamic threshold factor and consider slight adjustments (or dynamic modifications) to the extra blending composite exponent to further enhance model accuracy, lower BIC, and improve parameter recovery.
