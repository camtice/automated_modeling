For run 10, we want to further boost performance by tweaking the nonlinear transformation. Consider incorporating a fixed multiplier inside the logarithm (for example, replacing log(1+|x|) with log(1+2|x|)) to promote smoother behavior near zero without adding extra learnable parameters. Continue using the normalized fairness gap F = (split_self/combined_earning) – (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)). Use exactly three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi) with the same bounds. The model should then compute U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi), where f could be defined as f(x) = sgn(x) × (|x|^(0.5) + log(1 + 2×|x|)). Finally, convert U into p_accept via the logistic function. The instructions should emphasize thoughtful experimentation with the transformation’s curvature to improve accuracy, reduce BIC, and enhance parameter recovery.

For run 10 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making with these requirements:

1. Compute the normalized offer percentage as:
  N_offer = split_self/combined_earning,
  and the normalized fair share as:
  N_share = token_self/(token_self+token_opp).

2. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer – N_share.

3. Apply an adaptive, nonlinear transformation f(·) to the fairness gap scaled by phi. For example, consider:
  f(x) = sgn(x) × (|x|^(0.5) + log(1 + 2×|x|)),
to encourage smoother behavior near zero and improved model performance. You are encouraged to experiment with modifications to the transformation as long as the model retains only the three learnable parameters.

4. Use exactly three learnable parameters with these bounds:
  – beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  – gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  – phi (scaling) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

5. Define the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi)
  where F is the fairness gap computed above and f(·) is your chosen nonlinear transformation.

6. Convert U into a choice probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).

7. Provide the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and detailed JSON-formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

8. Clearly indicate the predicted target variable in <target_variable> tags (set to “accept”).

Your goal is to encourage innovative, out-of-the-box thinking via a flexible nonlinear transformation that equally prioritizes improved accuracy, reduced BIC, and robust parameter recovery.
