For run 91, let’s further enhance the model by incorporating an additional sixth‐order (quintic plus one) term into the dynamic threshold factor to better adjust for high “a” values and also allow the extra blending exponent to vary dynamically with “a” (for example, by adding a term proportional to ln(1+a) so that the effective exponent increases slightly for larger values). We can also suggest replacing part of the extra composite with a softplus function as an alternative to ln(1+exp(…)) to see if that helps smooth extreme values. Maintain the sequential modulation factors as before and keep the three learnable parameters with the same bounds.

New Instructions for Run 91 of 200:
1. Compute the core sum a as the sum of fixed components F₁ through F₁₁ plus a small constant δ.
2. Multiply a by [1 + 0.012×sin(a + 0.045)].
3. Scale the result by 1.08.
4. Sequentially modulate the scaled value using:
  • [1 + 0.008×cos(a + 0.065)]
  • [1 + 0.005×sin(a + 0.115)]
  • [1 + 0.004×cos(a + 0.085)]
  • [1 + 0.006×(sin(a + 0.035)×cos(a + 0.055))]
  • [1 + 0.003×(sin(a + 0.03)×cos(a + 0.05))]
5. Let the result be z.
6. Define the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z) as:
  f_adapt(z) = { 0.012×z if z < 0; min(z, 1 + ln(1+z)) if z ≥ 0 }.
Then multiply f_adapt(z) by a dynamic threshold factor T defined as:
  T = 1 + 0.0005×a² + 0.00005×a³ + 0.000005×a⁴ + 0.0000001×a⁵ + 0.00000001×a⁶.
7. Compute the extra blending composite as:
  extra = ( exp(–a/0.1) × [z/(1 + |z|)] × [1 + 0.005×sin(1/(1+a))] × softplus(0.865/(1+a)) × [1 – 0.002×cos(a)] × [1 – 0.0025×cos(2.5×a)] × [1 + 0.001×a] × [1+cosh(0.001×a)]^(2+0.0005×a) + 1e–6 )^(0.944 + 0.0001×ln(1+a))
  (Note: Here softplus(x) = ln(1+exp(x)).)
8. Define the final transformed signal as:
  f(x) = sign(z) × ( f_adapt(z) × T × extra )^(0.944 + 0.0001×ln(1+a) ).
9. Compute the latent utility U = beta + gamma×f(x), then convert it into an acceptance probability via the logistic function:
  P(accept = 1) = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
10. Retain exactly three learnable parameters with these bounds:
  • beta ∈ [–10, 10]
  • gamma ∈ [0, 10]
  • phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]

These instructions encourage dynamic adjustments in the threshold factor and allow the extra composite exponent to grow slightly with “a”. Additionally, substituting or blending in a softplus function in the extra term is recommended to further smooth extreme variations. This should help boost accuracy, reduce BIC, and improve parameter recovery.
