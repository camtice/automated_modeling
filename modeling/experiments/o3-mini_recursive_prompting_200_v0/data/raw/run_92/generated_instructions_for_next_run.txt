For this run, update the instructions to push the model to explore even more flexible threshold and extra blending dynamics. In addition to adding a seventh‐order term in T, include an optional eighth‐order term to allow tighter control over high “a” values. Also, modify the extra blending composite by blending the standard softplus function ln(1+exp(x)) with a small linear term (for example, 0.1×x) to further smooth extreme behaviors. Encourage designers to consider using novel nonlinear activation functions—such as leaky or parametric ReLUs—or even adaptive combinations of subcomponents. The three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi) must remain strictly bounded as before.

New Instructions for Run 93 of 200:
1. Compute the core sum a as the sum of fixed components F₁ through F₁₁ plus a small constant δ.
2. Multiply a by [1 + 0.012×sin(a + 0.045)].
3. Scale the result by 1.08.
4. Sequentially modulate the scaled value using:
  • [1 + 0.008×cos(a + 0.065)]
  • [1 + 0.005×sin(a + 0.115)]
  • [1 + 0.004×cos(a + 0.085)]
  • [1 + 0.006×(sin(a + 0.035)×cos(a + 0.055))]
  • [1 + 0.003×(sin(a + 0.03)×cos(a + 0.05))]
5. Let the result be z.
6. Define the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z) as:
  f_adapt(z) = { 0.012×z if z < 0; min(z, 1 + ln(1+z)) if z ≥ 0 }.
7. Multiply f_adapt(z) by a dynamic threshold factor T defined as:
  T = 1 + 0.0005×a² + 0.00005×a³ + 0.000005×a⁴ + 0.0000001×a⁵ + 0.00000001×a⁶ + 0.000000001×a⁷ + 0.0000000001×a⁸.
8. Compute the extra blending composite as:
  extra = ( exp(–a/0.1) × [z/(1 + |z|)] × [1 + 0.005×sin(1/(1+a))] × [softplus(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.1×(0.865/(1+a))] × [1 – 0.002×cos(a)] × [1 – 0.0025×cos(2.5×a)] × [1 + 0.001×a] × [1+cosh(0.001×a)]^(2+0.0005×a) + 1e–6 )^(0.944 + 0.00015×ln(1+a)).
  (Note: softplus(x) = ln(1+exp(x)); designers may experiment with blending this with a linear term.)
9. Define the final transformed signal as:
  f(x) = sign(z) × ( f_adapt(z) × T × extra )^(0.944 + 0.00015×ln(1+a) ).
10. Compute the latent utility U = beta + gamma×f(x), then convert it into an acceptance probability via the logistic function:
  P(accept = 1) = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
11. Retain exactly three learnable parameters with these bounds:
  • beta ∈ [–10, 10]
  • gamma ∈ [0, 10]
  • phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]
Additionally, encourage any out‐of‐the‐box ideas such as novel nonlinear activations (e.g., leaky, parametric ReLUs, or adaptive subcomponent learning) that might further lower the BIC, boost parameter recovery, and improve accuracy while maintaining the overall structure.
