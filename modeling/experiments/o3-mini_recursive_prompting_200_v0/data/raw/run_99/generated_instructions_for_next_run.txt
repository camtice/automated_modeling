For run 100, please maintain the same overall model structure, but explore further flexibility in the adaptive transformation and extra blending composite. In particular, consider implementing a convex combination between a leaky linear response and a saturating logarithmic response for f_adapt(z), where the mixing weight is governed by φ. For example, let f_adapt(z) = α(φ)*z + [1 – α(φ)]*ln(1+z) for z ≥ 0 (and a scaled linear response for z < 0). Also, enhance the dynamic threshold T by adding an extra cubic or quartic term (e.g., 0.000001×a³) to capture more curvature. For the extra blending composite, experiment with increasing the weight of the softplus component—perhaps by adding a fixed linear term—and consider alternative nonlinear functions to better cope with extreme values. Retain the overall structure: compute a as the sum of fixed components F₁–F₁₁ plus a small constant δ, modulate it sequentially by the given sine and cosine functions, then define z; apply the new flexible adaptive activation f_adapt(z) and multiply it by the dynamic threshold T and the revised extra blending composite (raised to an exponent that still involves ln(1+a)). Finally, compute the latent utility U = β + γ × f(x) and convert it via a logistic function. Keep exactly three learnable parameters with bounds: β ∈ [–10, 10], γ ∈ [0, 10], and φ ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. Be creative and feel free to adjust the functional forms in f_adapt and extra, so long as the overall model structure is preserved.

New Instructions for Run 100 of 200:
1. Compute the core sum “a” as the sum of fixed components F₁ through F₁₁ plus a small constant δ.
2. Multiply “a” by [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)] and then scale the result by 1.08.
3. Sequentially modulate the scaled value with:
  • [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)]
  • [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)]
  • [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)]
  • [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))]
  • [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))]
4. Define the resulting value as z.
5. For the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z), use a flexible formulation that blends a leaky linear response and a saturating logarithmic response. For example, for z ≥ 0 set f_adapt(z) = α(φ)*z + [1 – α(φ)]*ln(1+z), and for z < 0 apply a proportionally amplified linear response (e.g. φ * z). The mixing weight α(φ) should be a function of the learnable parameter φ.
6. Define the dynamic threshold T as:
  T = 1 + 0.0005×a² + 0.00005×a³ + 0.000005×a⁴ + 0.0000001×a⁵ + 0.00000001×a⁶ + 0.000000001×a⁷ + 0.0000000001×a⁸ plus an additional cubic/quartic term (e.g., 0.000001×a³) to capture extra curvature.
7. Compute the extra blending composite as:
  extra = ( exp(–a/0.1) × [z/(1+|z|)] × [1 + 0.005×sin(1/(1+a))] × [softplus(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.1×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.5×(0.865/(1+a))] × [1 – 0.002×cos(a)] × [1 – 0.0025×cos(2.5×a)] × [1 + 0.001×a] × [1 + cosh(0.001×a)]^(2+0.0005×a) + 1e–6 )^(0.944 + 0.00015×ln(1+a)).
  Feel free to experiment with blending the softplus term with an extra linear term to better accommodate extreme values.
8. Define the final transformed signal as:
  f(x) = sign(z) × ( f_adapt(z) × T × extra )^(0.944 + 0.00015×ln(1+a) ).
9. Compute the latent utility U = β + γ × f(x) and then the acceptance probability:
  P(accept = 1) = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
10. Retain exactly three learnable parameters with fixed bounds: β ∈ [–10, 10], γ ∈ [0, 10], and φ ∈ [0.5, 1.5].
Encourage creative, out-of-the-box modifications in defining f_adapt and extra to improve accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery while keeping the overall structure intact.
