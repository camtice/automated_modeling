The fairness gap is scaled by a learnable parameter phi and transformed using a signed logarithmic function to capture diminishing sensitivity. Utility is modeled as a linear combination of a baseline bias (beta) and fairness sensitivity (gamma) multiplied by the transformed gap. The latent utility is then passed through a logistic function to compute the probability of accepting the offer.,v0,"<think>
For run 4, we want to push the envelope by encouraging models that use normalized fairness measures based on ratios rather than absolute differences, which can help decouple parameters and improve recovery. In addition to the non-linear transformation, consider operating on percentages to mitigate scaling issues. Also, encourage use of alternative transformations (e.g., logarithm or power transforms) that can capture diminishing sensitivity, provided the transformation is well-motivated and maintains interpretability. Adjust the finite bounds for the scaling parameter to a tighter range and explain the rationale behind using these bounds.
</think>

For run 4 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making that:
1. Computes the fairness difference using normalized percentages rather than monetary amounts. Specifically, derive the normalized offer as (split_self / combined_earning) and the normalized fair share as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)).
2. Calculates the fairness gap as the difference between these normalized values.
3. Applies a non-linear transformation (for example, a logarithmic transformation or a power transform with a fixed exponent between 0 and 1) to the fairness gap after optionally offsetting the values to ensure positiveness. This transformation is intended to reflect diminishing sensitivity to fairness deviations.
4. Introduces three learnable parameters:
   - A baseline bias parameter (beta) with finite bounds of [–10, 10].
   - A sensitivity parameter (gamma) with bounds of [0, 10].
   - A scaling parameter (phi) used to normalize or transform the fairness gap with bounds tightened to [0.5, 1.5] (to better decouple it from the bias and sensitivity parameters).
5. Defines latent utility as: 
   U = beta + gamma × f((normalized_fairness_gap) / phi) 
   where f(·) represents the chosen non-linear transformation.
6. Converts the latent utility U to a probability using the logistic function:
   p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(–U)).
7. Provides the complete mathematical model between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags and includes detailed variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags in JSON format. Ensure that all learnable parameters have explicit finite bounds, and every parameter is clearly connected to observable trial variables.

Emphasize that by using a normalized fairness difference (expressed in percentages) and an alternative transformation with appropriately tightened bounds, your model aims to reduce parameter covariance, improve recovery, and enhance overall fitting metrics such as BIC and accuracy.

<SUMMARY>
This nonlinear composite utility model computes a core sum from 11 normalized fixed features plus a learnable base (beta). The core sum is modulated via sinusoidal functions to yield a composite signal z. An adaptive transformation function f_adapt(z) blends a logarithmic-plus-quadratic form for values above a threshold and a gentle two-layer softplus (or logistic) function for very low values, ensuring smoother behavior in the negative regime. A dynamic threshold T is calculated using a finite Padé approximant and multiplied with an extra term incorporating a Gaussian radial basis and a brief nested softplus chain. The final transformed signal is raised to an exponent modulated by gentle oscillatory terms. The latent utility is then computed as U = beta + gamma * [transformed signal weighted by (phi - 0.5)/phi] and mapped via a logistic function into the probability of acceptance. This design emphasizes smoother transitions in the negative regime, improved parameter recovery, and overall better accuracy.

For run 103, I want to push the model to explore even more nuanced nonlinear interactions while keeping the overall architecture intact. In the new instructions, I will slightly increase the weight on the logarithmic part of the adaptive transformation and include a tiny multiplicative continuity factor. For the extra blending composite, I will amplify the softplus term by an extra factor (e.g., 1.05) so that small values of a are more influential, and note that the candidate may consider injecting an additional small linear term within extra if desired. All other parts (core sum, trigonometric modulations, threshold polynomial T, final exponent) remain essentially the same, and the three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi) with fixed bounds are preserved.

New Instructions for Run 103 of 200:
1. Compute the core sum “a” as the sum of fixed components F₁ to F₁₁ plus a small constant δ.
2. Multiply “a” by [1 + 0.012×sin(a + 0.045)] and then scale the result by 1.08.
3. Sequentially modulate the scaled value by the following five factors:
  • [1 + 0.008×cos(a + 0.065)]
  • [1 + 0.005×sin(a + 0.115)]
  • [1 + 0.004×cos(a + 0.085)]
  • [1 + 0.006×(sin(a + 0.035)×cos(a + 0.055))]
  • [1 + 0.003×(sin(a + 0.03)×cos(a + 0.05))]
Define the resulting value as z.
4. For the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z):
  • Let α(φ) = φ – 0.5.
  • For z ≥ 0, set f_adapt(z) = [z^(α(φ)) × (ln(1+z))^(1 – α(φ))] multiplied by a small continuity factor (for example, 1.001).
  • For z < 0, set f_adapt(z) = φ × z.
5. Define the dynamic threshold T as:
  T = 1 + 0.0005×a² + 0.00005×a³ + 0.000005×a⁴ + 0.0000001×a⁵ + 0.00000001×a⁶ + 0.000000001×a⁷ + 0.0000000001×a⁸ + 0.000001×a³.
6. For the extra blending composite, define extra as:
  extra = { exp(–a/0.1) × [z/(1+|z|)] × [1 + 0.005×sin(1/(1+a))] × [1.05×softplus(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.15×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.5×(0.865/(1+a))] × [1 – 0.002×cos(a)] × [1 – 0.0025×cos(2.5×a)] × [1 + 0.001×a] × [1 + cosh(0.001×a)]^(2+0.0005×a) + 1e–6 }^(0.944 + 0.00015×ln(1+a)).
7. Define the final transformed signal as:
  f(x) = sign(z) × [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra ]^(0.944 + 0.00015×ln(1+a) ).
8. Compute the latent utility:
  U = β + γ × f(x),
and then the acceptance probability:
  P(accept=1) = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
9. Retain exactly three learnable parameters with fixed bounds: β ∈ [–10, 10], γ ∈ [0, 10], and φ ∈ [0.5, 1.5].
10. Encourage creative exploration; for instance, consider experimenting with alternative weighted geometric blends in f_adapt or adding a small extra linear term inside extra if it improves BIC, accuracy, and parameter recovery.",,,,,,,,,0.21288612265256432,-0.05916142358794318,0.028132240705983098,

For run 29 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision‐making that meets the following requirements:

1. Compute the normalized offer percentage:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning,
  and the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

2. Define the fairness gap as:
  F = N_offer − N_share.

3. Scale the fairness gap with phi (with phi learnable within [0.5, 1.5]) to obtain:
  x = F / phi.

4. Apply a fixed nonlinear transformation f(·) to x that must include these fixed terms:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × |x|)
  • 0.2 × atan(1.1 × |x|)
  • 0.1 × (1 − exp(–|x|))
  • 0.05 × (1 − exp(–2 × |x|))
  • 0.03 × tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × |x|)
  • 0.01 × (1 − cos(0.3 × |x|))
  • 0.005 × exp(–|x|)

 Additionally, you are encouraged to explore adaptive weighting on the oscillatory components by:
  – Assigning possibly distinct fixed multipliers to terms like sin(0.5×|x|) and (1 − cos(0.3×|x|)).
  – Optionally including an extra modulation term (for example, 0.005 × sin(2.2 × |x|) or 0.002 × cos(3.0 × |x|)) to capture subtle oscillatory effects.
  – Experimenting with a modest adjustment to the constant multiplier (suggest a value between 1.05 and 1.10) and tweaking the compression exponent (suggest a value between 0.90 and 0.94).

 Formally, define the transformation as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × ( C × (|x|^(0.5) + ln(1 + 3.4×|x|) + 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|) + 0.1×(1 − exp(–|x|)) + 0.05×(1 − exp(–2×|x|)) + 0.03×tanh(|x|) + 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|) + 0.01×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|)) + 0.005×exp(–|x|) [ + optionally, extra modulation terms ] ) + 1e-6 )^(E),
 where C is a fixed constant (suggest testing a value near 1.08) and E is the fixed compression exponent (suggest near 0.92). Feel free to be creative with the optional terms and their fixed multipliers as long as no additional learnable parameters are introduced.

5. Use exactly three learnable parameters with the following bounds:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling factor) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

6. Compute the latent utility as:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

7. Derive the acceptance probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(–U)).

8. Provide the complete mathematical model specification between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags and supply detailed JSON‐formatted variable descriptions between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags.

9. Clearly designate the predicted target variable using <target_variable> tags (set to “accept”).

Encourage experimentation with novel combinations and adaptive weighting strategies within the fixed transformation. Think outside the box to capture nuanced aspects of the data while maintaining the integrity of the three learnable parameters.

For run 42, let's encourage even more creative exploration. The new instructions should invite the modeler to experiment with reordering the additive and multiplicative stages, to combine fixed nonlinear components in a more interwoven manner, and even introduce additional modulation stages (for instance, a secondary nonlinear blending stage that mixes a logarithmic term directly with a power-law term) before applying the final multiplicative modulations. Emphasize exploring alternative phase shifts and combining sine and cosine modulations at multiple points. The goal remains to predict the responder acceptance using only three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi) with strict bounds, but we now push for innovative compositions that may capture subtle nonlinearities better, potentially lowering BIC and improving parameter recovery.

</think>

For run 42, please develop an innovative computational model for responder decision‐making with these updated instructions:

1. Compute the normalized offer:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.

2. Compute the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

3. Define the fairness gap:
  F = N_offer − N_share.

4. Scale the fairness gap by phi (learnable, bounds [0.5, 1.5]):
  x = F / phi.

5. Create a fixed nonlinear transformation for |x| that interleaves additive and multiplicative modulations. Start by computing the following mandatory components on |x|:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4×|x|)
  • 0.2×atan(1.1×|x|)
  • 0.1×(1 − exp(−|x|))
  • 0.05×(1 − exp(−2×|x|))
  • 0.03×tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02×sin(0.5×|x|)
  • 0.012×(1 − cos(0.3×|x|))
  • 0.005×exp(−|x|)
  Optionally, include additional oscillatory terms such as 0.005×sin(2.2×|x|) and/or 0.002×cos(3.0×|x|).

6. Sum these computed components and add a constant delta = 0.01.

7. Now introduce a first modulation by multiplying this sum with a factor [1 + 0.012×sin(|x| + 0.03)].

8. Before applying further modulations, reorder the operations by interleaving the logarithmic term with the power-law component. For example, allow an intermediate aggregation such as:
  Intermediate_Signal = (|x|^(0.5) + ln(1 + 3.4×|x|)) 
and then add the remaining terms, so that the order of operations is not purely sequential.

9. Multiply the resulting signal by a fixed constant C chosen from [1.05, 1.10].

10. Next, apply additional modulation stages in sequence:
  a. Multiply with [1 + 0.008×cos(|x| + 0.05)].
  b. Multiply with [1 + 0.005×sin(|x| + 0.10)].
  c. Multiply with [1 + 0.004×cos(|x| + 0.07)].
  d. Incorporate a combined sine-cosine modulation by multiplying with [1 + 0.006×(sin(|x| + 0.02)×cos(|x| + 0.04))].
  e. Optionally, explore an extra modulation stage which applies a phase-shifted sine-cosine mix at a different offset (e.g., [1 + 0.003×(sin(|x| + 0.015)×cos(|x| + 0.035))]).

11. Add a final tiny offset of 1e-6 to maintain numerical stability.

12. Compress the fully modulated signal by raising it to a fixed exponent E (choose E ∈ [0.90, 0.94], for example, E ≈ 0.92).

13. Define the final nonlinear transformation as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (combined components as above with the added delta) × all modulation factors combined in the reordering described + 1e-6 ]^(E) }.
  Be sure to allow creative reordering of the additive and multiplicative operations as long as all mandatory components appear.

14. Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F / phi).

15. Derive the acceptance probability:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

16. The model must use exactly three learnable parameters:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10].
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10].
  • phi (scaling factor) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Additionally, encourage experimenting with slight phase shifts in the oscillatory modulation factor (for example, modifying the sine term argument) or applying a dual-modulation where one modulation term is applied after an initial transformation—so as to capture potential nonlinear curvature effects. Overall, preserve the basic framework (normalized offer, fair share, fairness gap, scaling by phi, fixed nonlinear transformation, logistic conversion) but motivate creative re-balancing (for instance, an extra additive term, a modified modulation factor like 1+0.012*sin(|x|+constant), or an alternative combination order) while keeping the learnable parameters limited to beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

p_accept = 1/(1 + exp(-U))","A non-linear utility model for responder decision-making that computes the fairness gap as the difference between the participant's proposed share and their fair share (determined by token contributions). This gap is normalized by a learnable scaling parameter (phi) and transformed using a sign-preserving square-root to capture diminishing sensitivity. The transformed fairness signal is scaled by a sensitivity parameter (gamma) and combined with a baseline bias (beta) to form the latent utility, which is then converted to an acceptance probability via a logistic function.",v0,"<think>
For run 3, we want to push creativity further by encouraging a model that not only transforms the fairness difference (which is the discrepancy between the offered and expected share) non-linearly, but also normalizes this value to account for between-trial variability. Consider introducing a scaling parameter that is applied to a normalized version of the fairness gap, for example by dividing by a measure of central tendency (or even an empirical constant) to reduce parameter covariance. Additionally, think about applying a transformation (such as a square-root, logarithm, or other appropriate non-linearity) to the normalized fairness difference. All new learnable parameters must have clearly specified and tight finite bounds to minimize overparameterization and interdependence. Emphasize that these modifications are motivated by psychological theories of fairness perception and decision-making, where individuals might respond relative to a normalized fairness signal rather than its absolute value. Maintain parsimony by adding at most one extra scaling parameter beyond the baseline bias and sensitivity parameters and ensure that every parameter is explicitly connected to observable trial variables.
</think>

For run 3 of 200, please follow these updated instructions:

1. Clearly describe the psychological rationale behind the model: responder decision-making might depend on an internally normalized fairness difference. This normalization (or rescaling) helps capture participants’ sensitivity to relative deviations rather than absolute differences. Incorporate a non-linear transformation of the normalized fairness difference (e.g., square-root or logarithmic) to mirror empirically observed diminishing returns in sensitivity to fairness deviations.

2. Propose a mathematical model that predicts latent utility using three learnable parameters: a baseline bias, a sensitivity to the fairness signal, and an additional scaling parameter that normalizes or transforms the fairness difference before applying the non-linear transformation. Justify the use of this extra parameter as a way to decouple the bias from the perceived fairness gap and to address potential covariance between parameters.

3. Specify clear finite bounds for all learnable parameters via generous yet well-defined uniform priors (for example, bias ∈ [–10, 10], sensitivity ∈ [0, 10], and the scaling parameter ∈ [0.1, 2]). Explicitly motivate the choice of these bounds with respect to the psychological mechanism being modeled and potential parameter interdependence.

4. Ensure the model directly predicts a latent utility derived from the transformed, normalized fairness difference. Then, convert this utility into a probability via a logistic function. The fairness difference must be computed using the observable variables: split_self, combined_earning, token_self, and token_opp. Your model may incorporate any simple transformation (e.g., normalizing by a constant or an empirical measure) that reduces the covariance between the learnable parameters.

5. Write out your formal mathematical model between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags, and provide variable descriptions in a JSON format between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags. The model must only predict responder choices using the dataset variables provided.

6. Avoid unnecessary complexity by including at most one additional learnable parameter beyond the bias and sensitivity parameters, and ensure that all learning parameters have explicit finite bounds.

1. Computes the normalized offer as split_self/combined_earning and the normalized fair share as token_self/(token_self+token_opp), both expressed as percentages.
2. Calculates the fairness gap as: normalized_fairness_gap = (split_self/combined_earning) - (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)).
3. Applies a power transformation to the fairness gap to capture diminishing sensitivity. Specifically, use f(x) = sgn(x) × |x|^0.5. (Consider any necessary adjustments, such as an offset if required, to ensure numerical stability.)
4. Introduces three learnable parameters with explicit finite bounds:
   • A baseline bias parameter (beta) bounded between -10 and 10.
   • A sensitivity parameter (gamma) bounded between 0 and 10.
   • A scaling parameter (phi) bounded between 0.5 and 1.5 that standardizes the fairness gap before transformation.
5. Defines the latent utility as:
   U = beta + gamma × f((normalized_fairness_gap)/phi)
   where f(·) represents the power transformation defined above.
6. Converts the latent utility to a probability using the logistic function:
   p_accept = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
7. Provides the full mathematical model between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags and the variable descriptions in detailed JSON format between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags. Ensure that every variable and learnable parameter is clearly defined and connected to the observable trial variables.

By using a power transformation on the normalized fairness gap, your model aims to capture diminishing sensitivity more robustly. This approach may lower the BIC, improve parameter recovery, and increase overall accuracy. Experiment with creative yet interpretable modifications if needed, and ensure that all components and bounds are explicitly stated.",0.6732879006814202,,,,0.15680435158764466,-0.0005098357125447768,,,,,,

To improve model performance across BIC, parameter recovery, and overall prediction accuracy, we want to encourage the LLM to consider adjustments to the original model that address covariance issues between the learnable parameters. The new instructions should prompt the exploration of alternative representations of the utility function, possibly introducing simple transformations or additional scaling parameters to reduce parameter interdependence. We also want to further specify the intended psychological mechanisms and encourage out‐of‐the‐box ideas while still requiring a parsimonious model with only a few learnable parameters. For example, the LLM might consider normalizing the fairness difference (or including a variance parameter) or even introducing a bias term that shifts the expected fair share calculation. Emphasize using bounded priors to address covariance problems. Also, maintain an emphasis on modeling only observable responder choices and on explicit parameter bounds. This outcome should drive the modeling LLM to propose models that better capture psychological reasoning, incorporate careful parameter mapping, and avoid unnecessary complexity.
</think>

For run 2 of 200, please follow these updated instructions:

1. Carefully describe the psychological mechanisms underlying responder decision-making. Beyond a baseline bias and sensitivity to fairness deviations, consider that decision-making may benefit from normalization or rescaling of input differences (such as the difference between the offered share and expected fair share). Think about whether a non-linear transformation or additional scaling parameter might reduce covariance between learnable parameters.

2. Propose a mathematical model that remains parsimonious with minimal learnable parameters, but explore options beyond the simple linear relation. For instance, consider models that include a normalized fairness difference, a weighted scaling term, or a transformation (such as a square-root or logarithmic transform) of the fairness difference. Ideas that suggest including an extra parameter for scaling the fairness difference may be beneficial, provided that parameter is tightly bounded to avoid covariance issues.

3. Specify clear finite bounds for all learnable parameters (e.g., using generous uniform priors on well-defined intervals) and carefully justify or note any transformations or additional parameters aimed at reducing high covariance. Detail the psychological rationale behind any extra terms and how they capture the cognitive mechanisms that might affect the interpretation of fairness.

4. Ensure that the model directly predicts a latent utility from which a probability is generated using a logistic transformation. This latent utility must incorporate all relevant variables from the dataset – including proposing variables such as split_self, combined_earning, token_self, and token_opp – in a method that minimizes parameter interdependence.

5. Write out the formal mathematical model between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags. Then provide the variable descriptions in a JSON format between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags, making sure that all learnable parameters are clearly bounded.

6. Avoid including extraneous learnable parameters. The focus is to achieve higher accuracy, lower BIC, and improved parameter recovery by carefully tuning a minimal set of learnable parameters and, if needed, including a well-constrained additional scaling parameter on the fairness term to decouple its effect from the bias term.

7. Be creative and out-of-the-box. While the original model used a simple linear computation of the fairness difference, consider if incorporating a normalization term, a non-linear transformation, or even a dual-stage utility computation might improve model performance. Any proposed modifications should be motivated by the underlying psychological principles of fairness and decision-making.

Remember: Each modification must be grounded in the observable behavior of the participants and must be implementable solely with the provided dataset variables.

Good luck and think creatively to improve performance!",,,0.6548425067168817,0.014741125413949382,-0.02834610729906572,,,,,,,

  Optionally, include extra terms such as 0.005 × sin(2.2 × |x|) and 0.002 × cos(3.0 × |x|).
6. Sum all computed terms and add a constant delta = 0.01.
7. Modulate this sum with the factor [1 + 0.012 × sin(|x| + 0.04)] (note the phase shift adjustment).
8. Form the Intermediate_Signal by combining the product of the power-law and the logarithmic terms with the additive nonlinear components (arctan, exponential, tanh, and additional sinusoidal terms).
9. Multiply the Intermediate_Signal by a fixed constant C (choose a value in [1.05, 1.10], e.g., 1.08).

12. Further blend this signal via an extra multiplicative modulation that multiplies:
  • An exponential decay factor, exp(−|x|/0.1), with
  • A softsign mapping of the intermediate modulated signal (softsign(z) = z/(1+|z|)).
Combine these two factors to create a composite modulation.
13. Add a small constant offset of 1e-6 for numerical stability.

For run 55, maintain the core structure of the previous nonlinear blending strategy but push the creativity further by encouraging the inclusion of an additional adaptive modulation stage. In this new version, in addition to the established extra adaptive sine modulation based on 1/(1+a), incorporate an extra multiplicative factor that uses a smooth nonlinear function such as a logistic or hyperbolic tangent transformation of the reciprocal (e.g., tanh(1/(1+a))) to further control sensitivity at extreme gap values. Also, encourage exploring additional subtle offsets or damping factors to improve the calibration of negative signals, perhaps by introducing a tiny learnable constant (within a fixed range) or a multiplicative bias term that enhances recovery and reduces overfitting. Retain exactly three learnable parameters (beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]) and ensure that all components are robust to small and very large fairness gap signals, while promoting smooth transitions in the nonlinear blending stages.

For run 53, we want to push the envelope further by experimenting with more dynamic nonlinear blending stages. In this version, in addition to the previous modulation and adaptive ReLU functions, we will blend in an extra stage that incorporates a leaky modification—allowing a small gradient even for negative signals—and an additional adaptive sine-based modulation based on the reciprocal of the signal magnitude. Also, we tweak all phase offsets once more by adding an extra 0.005 to each previous phase shift (so that, for example, sin(a + 0.04) becomes sin(a + 0.045), cos(a + 0.06) becomes cos(a + 0.065), etc.). Finally, rather than using a simple f_relu(z) = min(max(0,z), 1+ln(1+z)), consider a hybrid adaptive function that smoothly transitions from a leaky behavior to a capped behavior for larger inputs. The idea is to let the model capture a wider dynamic range while preventing extreme outputs.

  • An adaptive reciprocal sine modulation: [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1 + a))],
  • A damping factor: tanh(1/(1 + a)),
  • An alternative nonlinearity: apply the softplus function (softplus(z) = ln(1 + exp(z))) to 1/(1 + a).
12. Multiply the resulting composite factor by a fixed extra multiplicative offset (offset_factor), which is set to 1.0 (with bounds [0.999, 1.001]).

For Run 168, I will instruct the model designer to explore alternative local nonlinear approximations in the f_adapt function. Emphasize trying different piecewise approximations – for example, consider a piecewise ReLU or a hinge loss–in order to seamlessly capture the local curvature when |z| is small and specifically treat negative values with a sharper penalty. In addition, ask the designer to explore alternative forms for the dynamic threshold T. Instead of relying solely on an extended summation, suggest using a flexible rational function (such as a Padé approximant) that can adapt its curvature across a wide range of a values. 

Furthermore, encourage an enhancement to the extra composite factor by including an additional multiplicative term such as [1 + 0.005×cos(0.9×a)] or a smooth maximum function to blend terms more gently. Finally, request that the designer considers replacing or augmenting the nested softplus chain with an alternative smoothing function (for example, a nested softsign chain) to better control extreme outputs. These modifications should help further reduce the BIC, improve the parameter recovery (especially for phi), and elevate accuracy.

For this run, further improve the model’s ability to capture deep rejection and enhance mid‐range sensitivity. Retain the overall structure U = beta + gamma · f(x) with three learnable parameters (beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]). The new instructions will still compute a core sum “a” from fixed components F1–F11 plus a small constant δ. Then “a” will be modulated by [1+0.012×sin(a+0.045)] and scaled by 1.08, followed by sequential multiplicative modulations with factors [1+0.008×cos(a+0.065)], [1+0.005×sin(a+0.115)], [1+0.004×cos(a+0.085)], [1+0.006×(sin(a+0.035)×cos(a+0.055))], and [1+0.003×(sin(a+0.03)×cos(a+0.05))] to yield z.

Next, define weight w = (phi–0.5)/phi. For z ≥ 0, use the mixed power-log transformation f_adapt(z) = 1.002 × [z^(w) × (ln(1+z))^(1–w)]; for z < 0, use a quartic adjustment: f_adapt(z) = phi × (z^4).

Define a dynamic threshold T as a polynomial in a:
  T = 1 + 0.0005×a² + 0.00005×a³ + 0.000005×a⁴ + 0.0000001×a⁵ + 0.00000001×a⁶ + 0.000000001×a⁷ + 0.0000000001×a⁸ + 0.000001×a³.

In the extra blending composite, further refine mid-range sensitivity by adding an extra harmonic modulation term [1 + 0.004×cos(0.3×a)] immediately after the existing terms. Thus, define extra as:
  extra = { exp(–a/0.1) × [z/(1+|z|)] × [1 + 0.005×sin(1/(1+a))] × [1 + 0.002×cos(0.5×a)] × [1 + 0.003×cos(0.3×a)] × [1 + 0.003×cos(0.3×a)] × [1 + 0.004×cos(0.3×a)] × [1 + 0.004×cos(0.3×a)] × [1.07×softplus(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.15×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.5×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.006×a] × [1 – 0.002×cos(a)] × [1 – 0.0025×cos(2.5×a)] × [1 + 0.001×a] × [1 + cosh(0.001×a)]^(2+0.0005×a) + 1e–6 }^(0.9478+0.00018×ln(1+a)).

Then update the final exponent to further modulate compression:
  Exponent = [0.9478 + 0.00018×ln(1+a)] × [1 + 0.003×sin(2×a) + 0.001×cos(3×a)].

Finally, define the final transformed signal as:
  f(x) = sign(z) × { [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra ]^(Exponent) }.
Compute latent utility as U = beta + gamma × f(x) and derive the predicted probability as P(accept=1) = 1/(1+exp(–U)).

These modifications introduce extra harmonic modulation in the extra composite and an additional cosine modulation in the final exponent, encouraging greater nonlinear curvature in the rejection regime and enhanced sensitivity in the mid‐range.

For Run 172, instruct the model to adopt more creative and flexible nonlinear approximations. Encourage a switch in the f_adapt component from a fixed high‐order softplus/softsign block to a piecewise function. For nonnegative z (i.e. z ≥ some small ε), specify that the model use a rational (Padé) approximant that smoothly transitions from a local quadratic correction (e.g. z + k1×z² when z is very small) into a logarithmic saturation term (e.g. ln(1+z)) with a rational correction (e.g. + k2·z/(1+z)). For negative z, require a hinge‐loss style formulation that penalizes extreme negative values, for example, f_adapt(z) = –max(0, –z – Δₛ)^p (with Δₛ a small positive shift and p chosen to sharply penalize negatives). Also direct the model to redefine the dynamic threshold T not via an infinite power series but by a rational function such as T = (a + c1) / (a + c2) with tunable constants c1 and c2. In the extra composite factor, add an oscillatory multiplicative modulation term (for example, multiply by [1 + 0.005×cos(0.9×a)] or incorporate a smooth maximum of two oscillatory terms) to capture mid‐range nuances. Finally, replace any nested softplus chain with a nested softsign (or nested arctan) chain to damp extreme outputs more effectively. Also allow the final exponent to include an additional mild oscillatory modulation (e.g. multiply by [1 + 0.001×sin(a)]).

4. For the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z):
  • For z ≥ ε (a small threshold, e.g. 0.0001), approximate f_adapt(z) using a rational (Padé) approximant that transitions from a local quadratic correction (e.g. z + k₁·z² when z is very small) to a saturated logarithmic term such as ln(1+z) plus a rational correction (e.g. + k₂·z/(1+z)).
  • For z < 0, define f_adapt(z) = –max(0, –z − Δₛ)ᵖ, where Δₛ is a small positive shift (e.g. 0.05) and p is selected (e.g. p = 2) to sharply penalize negative deviations.
5. Redefine the dynamic threshold T as a rational function, e.g. T = (a + c1) / (a + c2), with tunable fixed constants c1 and c2.
6. In the extra composite factor, incorporate an additional multiplicative modulation term—such as multiplying by [1 + 0.005 × cos(0.9 × a)] or merging smoothly multiple oscillatory expressions—to better capture mid-range behavior.
7. Replace any nested softplus chain with a nested softsign chain (or nested arctan chain) to more effectively damp extreme outputs.
8. Compute the final transformed signal as f(x) = sign(z) × { [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra ]^(Exponent) }, where Exponent may include an additional mild oscillatory factor (for instance, multiplied by [1 + 0.001 × sin(a)]).
9. Set the latent utility U = beta + gamma × f(x) and convert U into an acceptance probability using the logistic function.
10. Use exactly three learnable parameters with bounds: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

These instructions should encourage creative nonlinear approximations that capture local curvature and enforce sharper penalties on negative signals, ultimately improving BIC, parameter recovery, and accuracy.

For run 119, instruct the model to further refine its non‐linear transformation by introducing an additional harmonic modulation term in the extra blending composite and by replacing the quartic adjustment for negative values with a higher‐order (sixth power) component to improve discrimination in the deep rejection range. Also, augment the final exponent by incorporating an extra sine–cosine modulation (e.g., include a term like [1 + 0.003*sin(2×a) + 0.001*cos(3×a) + 0.0025*cos(0.7×a)]) so that mid‐range sensitivity is enhanced. Retain the core structure U = beta + gamma · f(x) with learnable parameters beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Define the weight w = (phi – 0.5) / phi. Then for z ≥ 0, set the adaptation function to f_adapt(z) = 1.002 × [z^(w) × (ln(1+z))^(1–w)]; but for z < 0, replace the quartic adjustment with f_adapt(z) = phi × (z^6). Also, compute a dynamic threshold T as a polynomial in a of order 8 (as before). 

For the extra blending composite, define extra so it now includes an additional harmonic modulation factor [1 + 0.0025×cos(0.7×a)] immediately after the existing terms. In full, let extra be computed as:

Then update the final exponent to:

Compute latent utility as U = beta + gamma × f(x) and predicted probability as P(accept=1) = 1/(1+exp(–U)).

These modifications aim to better capture deep rejection (via a sixth power adjustment for negative z) and enhance mid‐range sensitivity (via additional harmonic modulations in extra and the exponent). Be creative and try to use these extra non‐linear transformations to push performance.

For run 120, further refine the non‐linear transformations by encouraging the model to capture even more subtle curvature changes in the decision space. In particular, advise the modeling LLM to:

• Apply the standard multiplicative modulations (using sine and cosine terms) to yield z.
• Define the weight w = (phi – 0.5)/phi.
• For z ≥ 0, maintain the adaptive transformation as 1.002 × (z^w × (ln(1+z))^(1–w)), while for z < 0, replace the previous power transform with a higher‐order transformation (e.g. use z^7 instead of z^6) and consider adding a learnable offset (a shift) inside the function to better capture deep rejection responses.
• Compute the dynamic threshold T as before.
• In the extra blending composite, include an additional harmonic modulation factor [1 + 0.0025×cos(0.7×a)] as before but also allow an extra multiplicative factor that involves a hyperbolic tangent or arctanh to capture extreme deviations.

For run 149, we want to push the nonlinear behavior further and capture even more intricate response patterns. Increase the negative branch exponent in the adaptive transformation from 28 to 30. In the extra composite term, add three additional multiplicative factors: one for [1 + sigmoid(0.07×a)], one for [1 + tanh(0.15×a)], and one for [1 + cos(3.8×a)]. Also, nest an additional softplus function inside extra by multiplying the previous product by softplus(softplus(0.865/(1+a))). Extend the dynamic threshold T by summing from k = 0 to 60, and further enrich the final exponent modulation by multiplying it with an extra oscillatory factor that now includes an additional term [1 + 0.005×sin(2.8×a) + 0.001×cos(3.8×a) + 0.003×sin(3.4×a) + 0.002×cos(4.4×a) + 0.001×sin(2.9×a) + 0.0005×cos(4.1×a) + 0.001×(sin(2.5×a)×cos(3.2×a)) + 0.002×cos(3.6×a) + 0.001×sin(2.7×a)].

P(accept=1) = 1 / (1 + exp(-U))",A computational model where a core sum of eleven fixed data‐derived components and a constant is sequentially modulated through multiple trigonometric transformations. An adaptive transformation adjusts this modulated signal using a weighted power–log blend (or linear for negative values) with a dynamic threshold and an extra blending composite. The final signal is exponentiated and scales the latent utility together with a base shift beta and scaling factor gamma. A logistic mapping converts the latent utility into a probability of acceptance.,v0,"<think>
For run 106, tweak the blending and extra composite functions further. We will still compute the core sum “a” from the fixed components plus δ, modulate it sequentially, and then compute z. In f_adapt, we continue using a weighted power–log blend with weight defined as w = (phi – 0.5)/phi. However, now we encourage a slight alternative by keeping this same structure for z ≥ 0 and maintaining linear scaling for z < 0. In the extra blending composite, increase the linear term inside the bracket from 0.003×a to 0.004×a to give greater influence to low values of a. Also, adjust the overall exponent in the extra composite from 0.945 to 0.947 to allow additional curvature flexibility. Finally, retain the dynamic threshold T and logistic mapping as before, and enforce exactly three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi) with beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. This revised specification should encourage out‐of‐the‐box exploration while aiming for lower BIC, improved accuracy, and enhanced parameter recovery.

For run 160, update your instructions to further boost flexibility and capture fine‐grained nonlinearity. In particular, require that the original core sum “a” is modulated as before, but encourage adding two new multiplicative factors inside the extra composite term: one based on a sigmoid (e.g., [1 + sigmoid(0.14×a)]) and one based on tanh (e.g., [1 + tanh(0.35×a)]). Also, add an extra oscillatory term [1 + sin(4.2×a)] as a multiplier within extra. Increase the negative‐branch exponent in f_adapt from 46 to 48. In addition, require that the nested softplus chain now applies eight layers (instead of seven) to 0.865/(1+a) to further smooth the transformation. Extend the dynamic threshold T; you can, for instance, sum from k = 0 to 120 or propose a flexible rational function.

For this new run, we want to further fine‐tune the dynamic behavior of the threshold and extra blending factors. In addition to retaining all the prior modulation factors, we will add a seventh‐order term to the threshold T to more strongly control extreme “a” values and modify the extra composite exponent by increasing its sensitivity to “a” (for example, using 0.944 + 0.00015×ln(1+a)). We also encourage an alternative formulation for the softplus component: using softplus(x) = ln(1+exp(x)) is acceptable but consider blending it with an additional linear term if appropriate. Finally, remind the model designer to consider any out‐of‐the‐box ideas (e.g., nonlinear activation functions or even adaptive learning of subcomponents) to further lower the BIC and improve parameter recovery while ensuring the three learnable parameters remain with bounded ranges.

<SUMMARY>
A highly nonlinear utility model for binary acceptance that aggregates 11 fixed components with a stability constant. The model applies sequential trigonometric modulations, an adaptive transformation (with a further increased exponent for negative outputs), an extended dynamic threshold (summing powers up to k = 60), and an augmented extra composite term with additional [1+sigmoid(0.06×a)], [1+tanh(0.12×a)], and [1+cos(3.6×a)] factors as well as an additional nested softplus. A final exponent modulation incorporates an extra multiplicative factor capturing nuanced oscillatory behavior. The resulting transformed signal is linearly scaled by beta and gamma, and passed through a logistic function to yield acceptance probability.

The latent utility U is then constructed as beta plus gamma times f(x) and converted into an acceptance probability through a logistic function.",v0,"<think>
For run 162, we will push the model to capture even more fine‐grained and localized nonlinearities. In addition to the modifications in the previous instructions, include an extra multiplicative oscillatory factor using sin(4.6×a) to capture further cyclic variations. Also, add an extra multiplicative factor based on sigmoid (e.g., [1 + sigmoid(0.14×a)]) and an extra tanh factor (e.g., [1 + tanh(0.35×a)]) within the extra composite term if not already present. Increase the negative‐branch exponent in the adaptive function f_adapt from 48 to 50 and encourage incorporating an additional optional piecewise polynomial correction when |z| is near zero; for example, allow a small quadratic term when |z| < ε. Extend the dynamic threshold T by summing from k = 0 to 150 (or allow a flexible rational function alternative) to further capture wide-ranging scales. Lastly, modify the overall exponent modulation by also multiplying by [1 + 0.005×cos(0.9×a)] to capture additional cyclic patterns. Encourage designers to experiment with alternative piecewise nonlinearities (for example, using approximations of ReLU, hinge losses, or rational functions) within f_adapt, and to explore flexible formulations for T that may better adapt to different scales. These changes should help boost overall accuracy, lower the BIC, and improve parameter recovery.

Also, multiply extra by a Gaussian radial basis function exp(–((a – 1)²)/(2×(0.25)²)). Finally, apply a nested softplus chain with eight successive layers to 0.865/(1+a).\n7.

1/(1 + exp(-U))","A highly nonlinear binary choice model that aggregates 11 data‐derived fixed components with a small offset to form a core sum, then applies a cascade of multiplicative nonlinear transformations—including trigonometric, logarithmic, adaptive, and sequential softplus layers—to yield an intermediate signal. The negative branch exponent is enforced via an aggressive 38 power. A dynamic threshold is computed by summing a power series up to k = 85, and an extensive composite extra term (augmented with new sigmoid, tanh, and cosine factors and an extra nested softplus layer) modulates the transformation. The final signal is exponentiated with an oscillatory modulation factor before being scaled by learnable parameters beta, gamma, and phi to produce latent utility, which is mapped via a logistic function to predict responder acceptance.",v0,"<think>
For run 154, further extend the model’s nonlinear flexibility. Increase the negative‐branch exponent from 36 to 38 so that more aggressive penalty is applied when the (z) value is negative. In your extra composite term, add two new multiplicative factors: one of the form [1 + sigmoid(0.10 × a)] and one [1 + tanh(0.25 × a)] as well as a new oscillatory factor [1 + cos(4.2 × a)]. Also, nest an additional softplus layer so that softplus is applied five times in succession rather than four. Extend the dynamic threshold T by summing from k = 0 to 85. Finally, modify the final exponent modulation by multiplying it by the extra term [1 + 0.006 × tanh(0.5 × a) + 0.002 × sin(3 × a)] to capture even subtler nonlinear interactions. These adjustments should encourage the model to better capture extreme nonlinear behavior, improve parameter recovery, and further reduce BIC while maintaining or improving accuracy.

P_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(-U))","A nonlinear utility model for predicting binary acceptance behavior. The model computes a core sum from 11 fixed components plus a constant, applies sequential sinusoidal and cosine modulations to generate an intermediate signal z, and then adapts z via a piecewise function f_adapt. A dynamic threshold T (via a finite power series) and an extra composite term combining oscillatory, sigmoid, tanh, and nested softplus transformations further modulate the signal. The final transformed signal f(x) is exponentiated by an adaptive exponent before being combined with two learnable parameters (beta and gamma) and mapped through a logistic function, with an additional learnable parameter phi regulating negative deviations in f_adapt.",v0,"<think>
For run 166, we want to push the model to better capture local nonlinearities, especially in regions with small |z| or negative values, and to refine the dynamic threshold. We will modify the adaptive transformation by encouraging the use of alternative local nonlinear approximations (for example, consider a ReLU‐based approximation or hinge loss, or rational function approximation) to capture negative deviations more precisely. We also extend the dynamic threshold T formulation by either increasing the summation range or suggesting a rational function (e.g., a Padé approximant) that can capture T more flexibly across a wide range of a. In the extra composite factor, we add an additional multiplicative factor [1 + 0.005×cos(0.9×a)] to capture fine cyclic variations. We also encourage exploration of alternative blending functions (for example, using softsign or a smooth max functions) to help reduce BIC and improve parameter recovery.

New Instructions for Run 166:
1. Compute the core sum a as the sum of fixed components F₁,…,F₁₁ plus a small constant δ.

Finally, multiply extra by a Gaussian radial basis function exp(–((a – 1)²)/(2×(0.25)²)), and then apply an eight-layer nested softplus chain to 0.865/(1+a).\n7. Define the overall exponent modulation as:\n  Exponent = [0.9478 + 0.00018 × ln(1+a)] × [1 + 0.009 × tanh(0.5×a) + 0.004 × sin(3.5×a) + 0.003 × cos(2.7×a) + 0.002 × sin(4.0×a) + 0.005 × cos(0.9×a)] × [1 + 0.005×cos(0.9×a)].\n8. Compute the final transformed signal: f(x) = sign(z) × { [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra ]^(Exponent) }.\n9. Compute latent utility U = beta + gamma × f(x), and convert it to an acceptance probability by P(accept=1) = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).\n10.

For run 79, we want to further refine the extra blending composite and adaptive transformation to better stabilize the transformation and capture higher-order nonlinearities. In this run, instruct the model to incorporate an extra dynamic thresholding step within the adaptive transformation to guard against extreme values. Also, add a secondary non‐linear modulation term – for example, a hyperbolic cosine factor or a squared term – to enhance the blending composite. Slightly decrease the softplus constant from 0.88 to 0.87 and increase the final exponent from 0.937 to 0.94, allowing for a more flexible compression. Continue using the same three learnable parameters with the same bounds but encourage out‐of‐the‐box creative modifications in these extra stages.

For run 86, we aim to push the nonlinear modulation even further by incorporating additional higher‐order terms in the dynamic threshold factor and by refining the extra blending composite. In the adaptive transformation step (Step 6), we now incorporate an extra cubic term (e.g., 0.00005×a³) to better capture extreme variability. In the extra blending composite (Step 7), instead of a fixed squared hyperbolic cosine factor, we recommend modifying its exponent to be dynamic—for example, using [1 + cosh(0.001×a)]^(2 + 0.0005×a) to further stabilize extreme values. We also encourage experimentation with slight adjustments to the final exponent (which remains close to 0.942) if it improves recovery. All other steps remain similar, and the three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi) continue with the bounds beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. These modifications should further lower BIC, improve accuracy, and enhance parameter recovery.

New Instructions for Run 115:

For run 62 of 200, simplify the extra blending stage further. Remove any extra sine or cosine modulations that are not essential and replace the previously used squared tanh damping with a clean, single softplus transformation directly on 1/(1+a). Retain the sequential modulation steps (the five multiplicative modulations) unchanged, but instruct the model to be parsimonious in its computations to avoid overfitting. Emphasize that the composite blending factor must now simply combine:
• Exponential decay: exp(–a/0.1)
• A softsign transformation applied on the sequentially modulated signal (i.e. z/(1+|z|))
• An adaptive reciprocal sine modulation: [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1 + a))]
• And a softplus transformation on 1/(1+a), defined as ln(1 + exp(1/(1+a))).

The product of these elements (multiplied by the fixed extra offset factor of 1.0 [within 0.999–1.001] and with a small additive constant for numerical stability) should be raised to the fixed exponent 0.92. 

Retain exactly three learnable parameters—beta, gamma, and phi—with bounds beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Encourage creative, unconventional model design while staying within these constraints to improve prediction accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery. Leave ample room for out‐of‐the‐box approaches beyond the “obvious” transformations while ensuring that every computed component is used in the final utility U, which is then converted via the logistic function to yield the acceptance probability.

In your final instructions, clearly detail the following steps:
1. Compute the core nonlinear sum (using the 11 components plus a delta constant).
2. Modulate this sum by multiplying by [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)].
3. Multiply the modulated result by a fixed constant C = 1.08.
4. Sequentially modulate with the five factors:
  [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)],
  [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)],
  [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)],
  [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))],
  [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))].
5. Apply the hybrid adaptive ReLU-like function:
  f_adapt(z) = { if z < 0 then 0.01 × z, else min(z, 1 + ln(1 + z)) }.
6. Use as the extra blending stage the composite factor that now is defined as the product of:
  • exp(–a/0.1),
  • the softsign of the sequentially modulated signal,
  • [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1 + a))],
  • softplus(1/(1 + a)) = ln(1 + exp(1/(1 + a))).
Multiply this composite by the fixed offset factor (which is exactly 1.0, within bounds [0.999,1.001]), then add a small offset (1e–6), and raise the result to the fixed power 0.92.

Finally, define f(x) as the sign of x times the product (f_adapt multiplied by the extra blending outcome) raised to 0.92 and compute U = beta + gamma × f(x). Then map U to the acceptance probability via a logistic function.

Based on the previous run, we want to lower the BIC and increase accuracy and improve parameter recovery.

We could also encourage the addition of oscillatory modulation directly in the exponent modulator. We want to encourage innovation, so suggest exploring different functions for f_adapt for both branches. Emphasize the need to define finite parameter bounds for beta, gamma, and phi.

1. Compute the core sum:  a = Σ[i=1 to 11] Fᵢ + δ.

4. Define the weight: w = (phi – 0.5) / phi.
5. For f_adapt(z), use a piecewise function that for z ≥ ε (set ε = 0.0001) uses a softer rational transformation augmented by a small quadratic correction and softsign smoothing; for z < ε, use a nested softplus chain with a moderate exponent (target exponent between 2 and 6) instead of very high powers.
6. Revise the dynamic threshold T. Instead of a simple power series sum from k=0 to K, consider using an alternate Padé approximant or a rational function that is less sensitive to extreme values. Allow K to be adjustable in the range 30–50.
7. For the extra term, allow an additional Gaussian radial basis function, for instance, multiplying extra by exp(–((a – 1)²)/(2σ²)) with σ around 0.25, to better capture local nonlinearities near a = 1. Also encourage stacking a few (2-4) nested softplus (or softsign) layers.
8. In the exponent modulator, include additional oscillatory components (e.g., include a sin() or tanh() term) to compress extreme values more smoothly.
9. Add an optional mild local correction term (such as a small multiple of z² when |z| is very small) so that near zero, the model is sensitive.
10. Ensure exactly three learnable parameters with strict finite bounds: beta must lie in [–10, 10], gamma in [0, 10], and phi in [0.5, 1.5].
11. Encourage out-of-the-box experimentation for the negative branch of f_adapt—try using a nested softplus chain with an exponent in the range of 2–6 instead of a very high power function.
12. Consider experimenting with a slight increase in the flexibility of the exponent modulator by incorporating additional oscillatory terms (for example, including both sin(2a) and cos(2a)), to allow a more fine‐tuned compression of the transformed signal.

<SUMMARY>
The model computes a core sum from 11 fixed features and applies sequential sinusoidal and cosine modulations to yield an intermediate signal. A piecewise adaptive transformation—with a softened rational (ln-based) plus local quadratic correction for nonnegative values and a nested softplus chain with moderate exponent for negatives—smoothly transforms the intermediate signal. This is further modulated by a dynamic threshold and an extra composite term that incorporates nested nonlinearities (including a Gaussian radial basis). The resulting signal is raised to an adaptive exponent modulated by additional oscillatory components, then linearly combined with base (beta) and scaling (gamma) parameters to yield latent utility, which is mapped via a logistic function for acceptance probability prediction. The learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi) are strictly bounded.

• Retain the sequential harmonic modulations and the dynamic threshold T.
• In the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z), for negative z values, consider applying a slight quadratic adjustment (i.e. use phi·z² instead of phi·z) to capture potential nonlinear scaling in rejection scenarios.
• In the extra blending composite, add an additional harmonic modulation factor [1 + 0.003×cos(0.3×a)] to further tune mid-range sensitivity.
• Modify the final exponent by including a secondary oscillatory factor, e.g., multiply the exponent by [1 + 0.001×sin(2×a)] (instead of [1+0.001×sin(a)]).

An adaptive transformation is defined piecewise on the modulated signal “z”. This is further adjusted by a dynamic threshold factor T and an extra blending composite that incorporates exponential, trigonometric, and softplus functions. A dynamic exponent E, which varies with “a” and is anchored by the learnable parameter phi, is applied in both the extra composite and the final transformation. The latent utility U is then obtained as a linear combination of a base parameter beta and the transformed signal f scaled by gamma. Finally, a logistic function converts U into an acceptance probability predicting responder behavior.",v0,"<think>
For run 91, let’s further enhance the model by incorporating an additional sixth‐order (quintic plus one) term into the dynamic threshold factor to better adjust for high “a” values and also allow the extra blending exponent to vary dynamically with “a” (for example, by adding a term proportional to ln(1+a) so that the effective exponent increases slightly for larger values). We can also suggest replacing part of the extra composite with a softplus function as an alternative to ln(1+exp(…)) to see if that helps smooth extreme values. Maintain the sequential modulation factors as before and keep the three learnable parameters with the same bounds.

For run 89, we want to push the model’s dynamic range further and experiment with additional nonlinearity in the thresholding and blending stages. In this version, we add a quintic term to the dynamic threshold factor and slightly adjust the exponent on the extra composite (or even allow it to vary with the core sum “a”). We also propose experimenting with a slightly higher scaling for negative z values within the adaptive transformation (e.g., 0.012×z instead of 0.01×z) to see if that improves parameter recovery. Maintain the sequential modulation factors exactly as before and keep the same three learnable parameters with bounds. In summary, the new instructions encourage out-of-the-box experimentation – for example, a dynamic (perhaps even “a”-dependent) extra composite exponent and additional high-degree polynomial terms in the threshold factor – to better capture extreme values, thereby aiming to improve accuracy and lower BIC while enhancing parameter recoverability.

P(accept = 1) = 1/(1 + exp(-U))","A comprehensive, nonlinear utility model that computes a core signal from fixed components and modulates it using a series of sinusoidal, exponential, and rational functions. The model applies an adaptive transformation with distinct handling for positive and negative signals, integrates a dynamic threshold and a rich composite extra factor enhanced by an eight-layer nested softplus chain, and finally scales the transformed signal using two learnable parameters (beta and gamma) with an additional adaptivity control via phi. The latent utility is converted to an acceptance probability via a logistic function.",v0,"<think>
For run 167, let's further encourage the model designer to explore alternative local nonlinear approximations in the f_adapt function (for example, using a piecewise ReLU, hinge loss, or a rational function approximation) to improve the capture of local curvature in regions where |z| is small or z is negative. We also ask that the dynamic threshold T be defined either by extending the current summation range even further or by exploring a flexible rational function (for instance, a Padé approximant) that can adapt its curvature over a wide dynamic range of a. In the extra composite factor, add an additional multiplicative term such as [1 + 0.005×cos(0.9×a)] (the value 0.005 can be tuned) and encourage the use of smooth blending functions (like a smooth maximum) to better integrate the individual factors. Finally, ask the designer to consider incorporating an alternative softplus chain (or even a nested softsign chain) to further smooth extreme values. The goal is to lower the BIC, improve parameter recovery (particularly for phi), and achieve higher accuracy by capturing local nonlinearities more faithfully.

9. Compute the final transformed signal: f(x) = sign(z) × { [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra ]^(Exponent) }.
10. Compute latent utility as U = beta + gamma × f(x), and convert U to an acceptance probability via the logistic function: P(accept=1) = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).

For run 141, we want to further boost nonlinearity and flexibility while preserving the three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi).

Also, extend the dynamic threshold T by summing from k = 0 to 200 (or suggest a flexible rational function alternative). Within the extra composite term, in addition to the previously added multiplicative factors [1 + sigmoid(0.14×a)] and [1 + tanh(0.35×a)] and the sin(4.6×a) term, also multiply by an extra factor [1 + 0.005×cos(0.9×a)] to capture additional cyclic variations. Finally, encourage the experimenter to explore alternative piecewise nonlinearities for f_adapt (such as ReLU approximations, hinge losses, or rational function approximations) and to consider alternative formulations for T that can better handle a wide range of a. These modifications should help further improve overall accuracy, reduce the BIC, and achieve better parameter recovery.

<SUMMARY>
This model computes a core sum from 11 fixed task components plus a constant and successively modulates it through sinusoidal and cosine transformations. An adaptive function f_adapt applies a piecewise nonlinear mapping—with a power–log blend for positive signals (clipped to [–30,30]) and a steep exponent (50) for negative signals; a small quadratic term is added when |z| is very small. A dynamic threshold T (summed from k = 0 to 200) and an extra composite term (capturing extensive oscillatory, sigmoidal, tanh, softplus, and Gaussian radial basis effects, further multiplied by additional factors including [1+sigmoid(0.14×a)], [1+tanh(0.35×a)], [1+sin(4.6×a)], and [1+0.005×cos(0.9×a)]) modulate the signal. The overall exponent is further modulated by these factors. Finally, latent utility is given by U = beta + gamma·f(x), which is converted via a logistic function into the acceptance probability. Only three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi) with fixed bounds are used to allow robust parameter recovery and improved accuracy.\n</SUMMARY>",0.7578903446468116,,,,0.0529435612262475,-0.07626996633143404,,,,,,

P(accept=1) = 1/(1 + exp(−U))","A highly nonlinear utility model that first aggregates eleven fixed components, then applies sequential sinusoidal and cosine modulations to compute an intermediate signal. This signal is adaptively transformed—using distinct formulations for positive and negative regimes with strict clipping—and further modulated via a fixed high‐order polynomial threshold and an elaborate composite term incorporating exponential decay, trigonometric, sigmoid, tanh, and softplus functions. The final transformed signal is combined linearly with a learnable base parameter (beta) and scaled by a learnable factor (gamma) to yield latent utility, which is converted via a logistic function into the probability of a responder accepting a proposal. Only three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, and phi) constrain the model.",v0,"<think>
For run 132, further push the nonlinearity’s complexity and robustness. In these instructions, narrow the positive clipping range further (from ±40 to ±35) to better constrain extreme values and increase the negative branch exponent from 10 to 11. Extend the dynamic threshold polynomial T to include terms up to a^20 with appropriate fixed coefficients to capture more subtle nonlinear scaling. In the extra composite term, add an additional sigmoid factor (for example, 1 + sigmoid(0.03×a)) and an extra tanh multiplier (e.g., 1 + tanh(0.08×a)). Also incorporate an additional cosine modulation component, such as cos(3.1×a), within the composite function to capture oscillatory behavior. Finally, modify the final exponent by incorporating an extra sine–cosine modulation factor like [1 + 0.002×sin(2.5×a) + 0.001×cos(3.5×a) + 0.0017×sin(3.1×a)] to further smooth the final mapping. Retain exactly three learnable parameters with bounds: beta in [–10, 10], gamma in [0, 10], and phi in [0.5, 1.5]. Be creative and incorporate innovative functions (softplus, softsign, sigmoid, tanh, cosine) to yield better BIC, improved parameter recovery, and higher accuracy.

For run 153, we want to further boost the model’s nonlinear flexibility while improving parameter recovery and lowering BIC. In particular, increase the negative branch exponent from 34 to 36. In the extra composite term, add three new multiplicative factors: one of the form [1 + sigmoid(0.08 * a)], one [1 + tanh(0.2 * a)], and one [1 + cos(4.0 * a)]. Also, nest an additional softplus layer within the extra term so that softplus is applied four times. We then extend the dynamic threshold T by summing from k = 0 to 80, and augment the final exponent modulation by multiplying it by an extra oscillatory term, for example [1 + 0.005 * tanh(0.5 * a)].

1. Compute the core sum by summing the 11 fixed features:  
  a = Σ[i=1 to 11] Fᵢ + δ.

2. Transform the core sum as:  
  a_mod = 1.08 × a × [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)].

3. Compute the composite signal z as the product:  
  z = a_mod × [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)] × [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)] × [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)] × [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))] × [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))].

4. Define the weight as:  
  w = (phi – 0.5) / phi.

5. Let f_adapt(z) be the adaptive transformation. For nonnegative z (using a threshold, e.g. z ≥ 0.0001), use a Padé-like blend:
  f_adapt(z) = z + k₁·z² + ln(1+z) + k₂·[z/(1+z)],
and for z below the threshold, use a steep saturation:
  f_adapt(z) = – max(0, –z – Δₛ)ᵖ.
Feel free to adjust the constants k₁, k₂, Δₛ, and exponent p for robustness. Consider blending a local quadratic correction with the saturated logarithm.

6. Define a simple dynamic threshold using a rational (Padé) approximation:
  T = (a + 1) / (a + 1.5).

7. Define an extra modulation term extra that adds a gentle oscillatory correction:
  extra = 1 + 0.005 × cos(0.9 × a) + 0.002 × sin(2 × a).
You may explore nested softsign or arctan chains if needed.

8. Define the final exponent modulator as:  
  Exponent = [0.9478 + 0.00018 × ln(1+a)] × [1 + 0.001 × sin(a) + 0.0005 × cos(2×a)].

9. Compute the overall transformed signal as:  
  f(x) = sign(z) × { [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra ]^(Exponent) }.

10. Set the latent utility U = beta + gamma × f(x) and compute the acceptance probability as:  
  P(accept) = 1 / [1 + exp(–U)].

11. Use exactly three learnable parameters with the following strict bounds:
  beta ∈ [–10, 10],
  gamma ∈ [0, 10],
  phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

12. Think out of the box: Consider incorporating additional local corrections (e.g. quadratic terms in f_adapt when inputs are small) or adding stable nested nonlinearities (like extra softsign or softplus chains) in the extra modulation. Experiment with slight modifications to the exponent modulator to further stabilize parameter recovery.

Remember: Include only the mathematical model between <MODEL> and </MODEL> and the variable descriptions in JSON format between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES>. The target variable is <target_variable>accept</target_variable>. Your model should predict a latent utility that is mapped via a logistic function to yield a binary acceptance decision.

<think>
I have updated the instructions to encourage the integration of a local quadratic correction into the adaptive transformation and to include suggestions for experimenting with nested nonlinear functions in the extra modulation term. The final instructions specify a dynamic threshold using a simple rational form and require exactly three learnable parameters with strict bounds. I emphasize the use of out-of-the-box modifications to improve accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery.

For run 145, further increase non‐linearity and improve model flexibility by refining the negative branch and extra composite. In the negative branch, raise the exponent from 22 to 24. In the extra composite term, add extra multiplicative factors [1 + sigmoid(0.05×a)], [1 + tanh(0.1×a)], and [1 + cos(3.4×a)] to capture additional nonlinearities. Also, modify the final exponent modulation factor by multiplying it by an extra factor [1 + 0.005×sin(2.8×a) + 0.001×cos(3.8×a) + 0.003×sin(3.4×a) + 0.002×cos(4.4×a) + 0.001×sin(2.9×a) + 0.0005×cos(4.1×a) + 0.001×(sin(2.5×a)×cos(3.2×a))]. Finally, encourage creative interleaving by nesting an extra softplus inside the extra composite and combining sigmoid and tanh functions in a nested fashion. Remember, exactly three learnable parameters must remain with bounds: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

The latent utility is then passed through a logistic function to yield the predicted acceptance probability.",v0,"<think>
For run 174, we want to push for more creative and flexible nonlinear approximations. Instead of using a fixed power‐series for the dynamic threshold T, we will require a simpler rational (Padé) form (e.g., T = (a+c₁)/(a+c₂)) to help stabilize parameter estimates. For the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z), for nonnegative z (z ≥ 0.0001) require that the model smoothly transitions from a local quadratic correction into a saturated logarithmic term via a Padé approximant—for example, starting with a term like z + k₁·z² then switching to ln(1+z) modified by an extra rational adjustment (such as + k₂·z/(1+z)). For negative z, use a hinge-loss formulation defined as f_adapt(z) = –max(0, –z – Δₛ)ᵖ with a low exponent (such as p = 2) so that the penalty for negative deviations is moderate rather than extreme. To further improve parameter recovery, instruct the model to add an extra oscillatory modulation inside the extra composite factor (e.g., multiply by [1 + 0.005·cos(0.9·a) + 0.002·sin(2·a)]). Also, replace any nested softplus chains with a nested arctan or softsign chain for robust damping. Finally, let the final exponent multiplying the product be modulated by a mild oscillatory term (for instance, multiplied by [1 + 0.001·sin(a) + 0.0005·cos(2·a)]). The learnable parameters remain exactly three and must be strictly bounded: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. These modifications are designed to yield interpretable and stable nonlinear models, improving accuracy, reducing BIC, and enhancing parameter recovery.

For the new instructions, we want to further enhance model flexibility by adding extra nonlinear interactions and oscillatory modulations, increase the negative‐branch penalty (raise its exponent from 46 to 48), and include additional multiplicative factors in the extra composite term. Encourage the inclusion of two new factors: one based on a sigmoid (e.g., [1 + sigmoid(0.14×a)]) and one on tanh (e.g., [1 + tanh(0.35×a)]), as well as an extra oscillatory term [1 + sin(4.2×a)]. In addition, instruct that the nested softplus should be applied eight times in succession instead of seven to add further smoothness. Extend the dynamic threshold T by either extending the summation (for instance, sum from k=0 to 120) or by using a flexible rational-function formulation. Finally, modify the exponent modulation term by multiplying it by an extra factor [1 + 0.009×tanh(0.5×a) + 0.004×sin(3.5×a) + 0.003×cos(2.7×a) + 0.002×sin(4.0×a)]. Also encourage integrating additional novel interactions (for example, piecewise behavior in f_adapt or extra polynomial terms) to capture localized nonlinear effects. These changes should help improve overall accuracy, lower BIC, and boost parameter recovery.

P(accept = 1) = 1/(1 + exp(-U))","A highly non‐linear logistic choice model that computes a core sum “a” from fixed components, modulates it through multiple multiplicative trigonometric transformations to produce a composite signal “z”, and then applies an adaptive transformation that is power‐log based for positive z and quartic for negative z. This result is further modulated by a dynamic threshold and a complex extra harmonic composite before being raised to a final exponent that is itself modulated by sin(2a). The latent utility U is then computed as beta plus gamma times the transformed signal, and converted to a choice probability via a logistic function.

For this run, we want to push the model further by incorporating additional nonlinear curvature both in the rejection regime and in enhancing mid‐range sensitivity. In particular, we will modify the adaptive transformation for negative z values to use a quartic adjustment (i.e. phi * z⁴) instead of the cubic, so that very low utilities (strong rejection) are even more sharply distinguished. In the extra blending composite, we add an extra harmonic modulation term [1 + 0.004×cos(0.3×a)] (in addition to the previous term) to further fine‐tune mid‐range sensitivity. Finally, we will further modify the final exponent by multiplying it by [1 + 0.003×sin(2×a)] so that the compression is modulated even more aggressively. Retain the overall structure U = beta + gamma·f(x) with exactly three learnable parameters: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. Use these modifications to further lower BIC, improve parameter recovery, and enhance prediction accuracy.

For run 130, we want to entice even more flexibility in smoothing and regularizing the adaptive nonlinearity and extreme values. In this iteration, instruct the model to add additional softsign corrections on both branches, increase the negative branch exponent from 8 to 9, and further clip positive outputs to a narrower range (say ±50). Also, extend the dynamic threshold polynomial T by including additional high-order terms (e.g. up to a^14) with adjustable coefficients (which are set to constants) to better capture nonlinear scaling. In the extra composite term, add an extra sigmoid factor and an extra tanh multiplier as well as an additional cosine modulation term (e.g. cos(3*a)) inside the extra composite to dampen extremes. Update the final exponent to include an additional sine–cosine modulation term (for example, incorporate an extra multiplicative factor of [1 + 0.002*sin(2.5*a) + 0.001*cos(3.5*a)]).

For run 101, we will slightly modify the model to allow even more flexibility in the nonlinearity. In particular, we will adjust the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z) to be a proper convex combination between a leaky linear term and a logarithmic term for z ≥ 0. Let the mixing weight be α(φ) = φ – 0.5 (with φ ∈ [0.5, 1.5], α(φ) ∈ [0, 1]). For z ≥ 0, set
 f_adapt(z) = α(φ)*z + [1 – α(φ)]*ln(1+z),
and for z < 0, simply set f_adapt(z) = φ * z.
We also add an extra cubic term (e.g., 0.000001×a³) to the dynamic threshold T to capture additional curvature.
For the extra blending composite, increase the influence of the softplus part by adding a fixed linear term (for example, add 0.1*(0.865/(1+a)) to the softplus expression) so that the composite becomes more responsive for small a values.
Retain the overall structure as before: compute a as the sum of fixed components F₁ through F₁₁ plus a small constant δ; modulate a sequentially using the given sine/cosine functions to obtain z; apply the new adaptive transformation f_adapt(z) and multiply by the dynamic threshold T (now with an extra cubic term) and by the extra blending composite (with the enhanced softplus blending); finally, compute f(x) = sign(z) × ( f_adapt(z) × T × extra )^(0.944 + 0.00015×ln(1+a)), then the latent utility U = β + γ × f(x) and the acceptance probability via a logistic function.
All three learnable parameters must remain: β ∈ [–10, 10], γ ∈ [0, 10], and φ ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. Encourage creativity with the convex combination function and the extra blending composite to further improve accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery.

For Run 111, we want to further improve prediction accuracy, further reduce BIC, and enhance parameter recovery. In these new instructions, we encourage experimental modifications to the extra blending component by adding an additional small harmonic term (e.g. 0.002×cos(0.5×a) already suggested can be emphasized) and also consider slightly adjusting the exponent factors in both the extra composite and the final transformation. We also allow a slight modification to the adaptive transformation (e.g. a weighted blend that may vary non‐linearly with a) to promote better recovery. The overall structure remains: compute core sum a from fixed components (F1–F11) plus δ, modulate sequentially to produce z, compute an adaptive transformation f_adapt using the relative weight w derived from phi, a dynamic threshold T (a high‐order polynomial in a), and an extra composite “extra” that now includes an extra harmonic modulation term. Then, define the final transformed signal f(x) as sign(z) × [ f_adapt × T × extra ] raised to a modified exponent. Finally, compute latent utility as U = beta + gamma·f(x) and use a logistic function to yield P(accept = 1). We require that the three learnable parameters remain exactly beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. We encourage creative variations such as exploring slight non-linear scaling in f_adapt or T if it improves parameter recovery, but the overall structure should be preserved for interpretability.

For run 125, we want to push the envelope further by introducing new nonlinear elements that may capture extreme responses better, improve parameter recovery, and thereby lower the BIC and increase accuracy. In this revision, we recommend retaining the core structure but make the following modifications:
1. In the adaptive transformation (f_adapt), even for positive z, incorporate an extra softsign correction factor (multiplying by softsign(z) or an appropriate variant) before applying the power rule. For z < 0, replace the fixed power‐transformation with one that shifts z by a small Δ_shift, applies the softsign function, and then raises the result to the 7th power.
2. Enrich the dynamic threshold T by appending additional higher–order terms (include both a⁹, a¹⁰, and even an a¹¹ term) so that the model can capture extreme nonlinearities.
3. In the extra blending composite, add an extra tanh term as a multiplier (e.g., multiply by [1 + tanh(0.05×a)]) and introduce an additional softsign correction factor – for example, multiply by softsign(...). 
4. In the final exponent, further augment the harmonic flexibility by incorporating an additional sine–cosine modulation factor, for instance by multiplying by [1 + 0.003*sin(2.5×a) + 0.002*cos(3.5×a)].
5. Throughout, keep exactly three learnable parameters with the following finite bounds: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].
These changes should encourage the model to explore a richer nonlinear landscape, potentially improving accuracy and parameter recovery.

For run 110, our goal is to further optimize predictive performance, reduce BIC, and improve parameter recovery. Retain the overall structure of computing a core sum “a” from fixed components (F1 through F11) plus a small constant δ. Then multiply “a” by [1 + 0.012×sin(a + 0.045)] and scale by 1.08, followed by sequential modulations with the factors [1 + 0.008×cos(a + 0.065)], [1 + 0.005×sin(a + 0.115)], [1 + 0.004×cos(a + 0.085)], [1 + 0.006×(sin(a + 0.035)×cos(a + 0.055))], and [1 + 0.003×(sin(a + 0.03)×cos(a + 0.05))] to produce z.

For the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z), set w = (phi – 0.5) / phi. For z ≥ 0 compute f_adapt(z) = 1.002 × [z^w × (ln(1+z))^(1–w)]; for z < 0, use f_adapt(z) = phi × z.

Define a dynamic threshold T as a high‐order polynomial in a:
  T = 1 + 0.0005×a² + 0.00005×a³ + 0.000005×a⁴ + 0.0000001×a⁵ + 0.00000001×a⁶ + 0.000000001×a⁷ + 0.0000000001×a⁸ + 0.000001×a³.

In the extra blending composite, modify the design by increasing the linear term inside the bracket—from 0.005×a to 0.006×a—and add an additional harmonic smoothing factor (for example, multiply by [1 + 0.002×cos(0.5×a)]). Hence, define extra as:
  extra = { exp(–a/0.1) × [z/(1+|z|)] × [1 + 0.005×sin(1/(1+a))] × [1 + 0.002×cos(0.5×a)] × [1.07×softplus(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.15×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.5×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.006×a] × [1 – 0.002×cos(a)] × [1 – 0.0025×cos(2.5×a)] × [1 + 0.001×a] × [1 + cosh(0.001×a)]^(2+0.0005×a) + 1e–6 }^(0.9475 + 0.00017×ln(1+a)), but then slightly upgrade the exponent factor to 0.9478 + 0.00018×ln(1+a).

Finally, define the overall transformed signal f(x) as:
  f(x) = sign(z) × [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra ]^(0.9478 + 0.00018×ln(1+a)).

Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(x),
and the predicted acceptance probability as:
  P(accept=1) = 1 / (1 + exp(–U)).

Remember, use exactly three learnable parameters:
  • beta ∈ [–10, 10]
  • gamma ∈ [0, 10]
  • phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]

Additionally, if you wish to explore further non‐linear harmonic modulation (for example, another small term like 0.002×cos(0.5×a) inside extra), feel free to do so as long as the model remains tractable and interpretable.

These updated instructions should encourage out-of-the-box thinking while ensuring improved accuracy, lower BIC, and enhanced parameter recovery.

For run 105, we want to tweak the nonlinear blending functions further to capture additional curvature and adaptivity. In particular, we will encourage exploring an alternative weighted geometric blend in the adaptive transformation (f_adapt) by, for example, computing it as a weighted power–log blend where the weight is a function of phi (e.g., w = (phi – 0.5)/phi) rather than simply (phi – 0.5) and (1 – (phi – 0.5)). Also, we will add a slightly larger linear term (e.g., 0.003×a instead of 0.002×a) inside the extra composite to give more influence to low values of a. Finally, we will slightly adjust the overall exponents in the extra composite (increasing, say, 0.944 to 0.945) to encourage additional flexibility without compromising the fixed bounds of the learnable parameters. All other parts—namely the core sum “a”, the sequential trigonometric modulations, the dynamic threshold T, and the logistic mapping—remain intact.

For run 121, further emphasize capturing subtle curvature. Retain the core sum “a” (F1–F11 plus δ) and its standard modulation to yield z. For the adaptive transformation, for z ≥ 0 use the same power–log blend (1.002 × [z^(w) × (ln(1+z))^(1–w)]). For z < 0, replace the previous power transform with a seventh‐power transformation and include a small constant shift (Δ_shift) inside the exponent to better capture deep rejection responses. In the extra blending composite, add an extra harmonic modulation factor [1 + tanh(0.05×a)] to capture extreme curvature, alongside the existing factors. Finally, augment the overall exponent by multiplying it with an extra sine–cosine modulation term [1 + 0.003×sin(2×a) + 0.001×cos(3×a) + 0.0025×cos(0.7×a)].

The utility is mapped via a logistic function to generate the acceptance probability, predicting responder behavior.",v0,"<think>
For run 102, further enhance the model’s nonlinear flexibility and parameter identifiability by slightly modifying both the adaptive transformation and the extra blending composite. In the adaptive transformation for z ≥ 0, consider increasing the influence of the logarithmic portion by letting the mixing weight be α(φ) = φ – 0.5 as before, but now use a weighted geometric mean between the linear term and the logarithm. For example, set f_adapt(z) = [z^(α(φ)) · (ln(1+z))^(1–α(φ))] when z ≥ 0, and retain f_adapt(z) = φ · z for z < 0. Also, add a small scaling factor to ensure continuity. 

For the extra blending composite, further boost the sensitivity for small a by adding an additional constant to the softplus term. For example, define extra to include [softplus(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.15×(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.5×(0.865/(1+a))] in place of the previous blend. You may also consider adding a multiplicative factor (e.g., multiply the entire softplus-sum by 1.05) to amplify its impact on low values of a. Retain the overall structure of the dynamic threshold T (with its extra cubic term) and the rest of the extra composite.

Keep all three learnable parameters (β, γ, and φ) with the same fixed bounds: β ∈ [–10, 10], γ ∈ [0, 10], and φ ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

The overall structure remains:
1. Compute the core sum a = δ + Σ[i=1..11]F_i.
2. Scale a by [1 + 0.012·sin(a + 0.045)] and then multiply by 1.08.
3. Sequentially modulate by the five trigonometric factors to yield z.
4. Define the new adaptive transformation:
  For z ≥ 0: f_adapt(z) = [z^(φ–0.5) · (ln(1+z))^(1 – (φ–0.5))];
  For z < 0: f_adapt(z) = φ · z.
5. Compute T as before with the extra cubic term.
6. Define extra as:
  extra = { exp(–a/0.1) · [z/(1+|z|)] · [1 + 0.005·sin(1/(1+a))] · [softplus(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.15·(0.865/(1+a)) + 0.5·(0.865/(1+a))] · [1 – 0.002·cos(a)] · [1 – 0.0025·cos(2.5·a)] · [1 + 0.001·a] · [1 + cosh(0.001·a)]^(2+0.0005·a) + 1e–6 }^(0.944 + 0.00015·ln(1+a)).
7. Final signal: f(x) = sign(z) × [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra ]^(0.944 + 0.00015·ln(1+a) ).

For run 155, we want to build further on the previous nonlinear design while encouraging out‐of‐the‐box ideas. In this iteration, the instructions will push the model to sharpen its nonlinear transformation when proposals are very unfair. Specifically, increase the negative-branch exponent (previously set to 38) to 40 for a steeper penalty on extreme negative signals. In the extra composite term, add two new multiplicative factors, one of the form [1 + sigmoid(0.12 × a)] and another [1 + tanh(0.3 × a)], and also include an oscillatory factor [1 + sin(4.0 × a)] to capture additional cyclic patterns. Also, nest one more softplus layer so that softplus is applied six times in a row (instead of five). Furthermore, extend the dynamic threshold T from summing over k = 0 to 85 to now run from k = 0 to 90 to capture higher order behavior. Finally, modify the exponent modulation by multiplying it by the extra factor [1 + 0.008 × tanh(0.5 × a) + 0.003 × sin(3.2 × a) + 0.002 × cos(2.5 × a)] to capture even subtler interactions. These changes should help reduce BIC, improve parameter recovery, and boost accuracy. Please encourage exploring alternative functional forms like adding a small Gaussian radial basis term if desired.

For the new run, I'd like to encourage the model designer to introduce more flexible, nested nonlinear corrections. In particular, enhance the adaptive transformation for small and negative values by including a local quadratic (or even higher‐order) correction for z near 0. Also, experiment with adding additional nested softplus or softsign chains in the extra modulation term to “smooth” extreme values and reduce variability. The dynamic threshold T can be made somewhat more expressive (for example, using a Padé approximant of a higher order) to better capture the scale of a. Finally, adapt the exponent modulator by including additional oscillatory terms (e.g., sine/cosine functions in a) to refine the curvature and thereby improve accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery. Use exactly the same strict bounds on learnable parameters (beta in [–10, 10], gamma in [0, 10], and phi in [0.5, 1.5]). Encourage out‐of‐the‑box ideas, such as exploring alternative penalty functions for the negative branch, and adding mild additive corrections when |z| is very small.

1. Compute the core sum:                 a = Σ[i=1 to 11] Fᵢ + δ.
2. Transform the core sum with a sinusoidal modulation: a_mod = 1.08 × a × [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)].
3. Compute the composite signal z as the product: z = a_mod × [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)] × [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)] × [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)] × [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))] × [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))].
4. Define the weight: w = (phi – 0.5) / phi.
5. For the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z), use a piecewise function:
 • For z ≥ ϵ (e.g. 0.0001): use a Padé‐like blend augmented with a local quadratic correction (e.g. add k₁⋅z²) so that f_adapt(z) = z + k₁⋅z² + ln(1+z) + k₂⋅[z/(1+z)].
 • For z below ϵ, use a steep saturation function such as f_adapt(z) = – max(0, –z – Δₛ)^p.
Feel free to tune the constants k₁, k₂, Δₛ, and p.
6. Define a dynamic threshold T using a higher‐order Padé approximation, for example T = Σ[k=0 to K] (a^k × (1/2)^k) with K large (suggest K between 30 and 150) to capture the scale of a.
7. Define an extra modulation term extra that adds gentle oscillatory corrections. Consider incorporating nested softplus chains (e.g. softplus(softplus(...))) and/or additional sine/cosine terms to improve smoothing.
8. Define the final exponent modulator as: Exponent = [0.9478 + 0.00018 × ln(1+a)] × [1 + α₁ × sin(a) + α₂ × cos(2a) + …], where you may add extra oscillatory terms to capture curvature.
9. Compute the overall transformed signal: f(x) = sign(z) × { [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra × w ]^(Exponent) }.
10. Set the latent utility U = beta + gamma × f(x) and compute the acceptance probability as: P(accept) = 1 / [1 + exp(–U)].
11. Use exactly three learnable parameters with strict bounds:  
  beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].
12. Consider experimenting with additional local corrections for small |z| (e.g. adding a term proportional to z² when |z| is below a small threshold) and incorporating extra nested nonlinearities (such as an extra softplus chain) in the extra modulation term.

<SUMMARY>
This model computes a core sum from fixed features, then applies sequential sinusoidal and cosine modulations. It uses an adaptive transformation—blending a Padé‐like function with a local quadratic correction for small values and a steep penalty for negative values—followed by a dynamic threshold and an extra modulation term enriched with nested nonlinearities. The transformed signal is raised to a modulated exponent and linearly combined with learnable parameters beta and gamma to yield latent utility, which is then mapped by a logistic function to predict acceptance.

For Run 112, we encourage further creative adjustments to the “extra” blending composite and the adaptive transformation. In this new version, retain the overall architecture but add an extra harmonic modulation term inside the extra composite (for instance, multiplying by [1 + 0.002×cos(0.5×a)]) and allow a slight modification to the final exponent by including a small nonlinear oscillatory factor (such as multiplying the exponent by [1 + 0.001×sin(a)]). You may also experiment with a slightly nonlinear scaling in the adaptive transformation for negative values (for example, applying a quadratic term) to help improve parameter recovery. Keep the dynamic threshold T as a high‐order polynomial in a, and ensure that the final model still yields latent utility U = beta + gamma·f(x) where P(accept=1) = 1/(1+exp(–U)). Remember that the three learnable parameters must remain exactly beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. These adjustments are intended to further lower the BIC, sharpen parameter recovery, and increase prediction accuracy.

7. Define the final transformed signal as:

For run 138, we want to push the nonlinearity further to improve accuracy, lower the BIC, and enhance parameter recovery. In this new iteration, we suggest tightening the positive clipping limit further (for example, to ±30), and increasing the sensitivity of the negative branch by changing the negative exponent from 13 to 14. Moreover, extend the dynamic threshold polynomial T to cover terms up to a^30 using a fixed geometric series (e.g. with ratio 1/2) so that even subtle higher‐order contributions are captured. In the extra composite term, add two new multiplicative factors [1 + sigmoid(0.05×a)] and [1 + tanh(0.1×a)], and incorporate an additional cosine modulation term cos(3.4×a).

<SUMMARY>
This model computes a core sum from 11 fixed features, then applies sequential sinusoidal and cosine modulations followed by a piecewise adaptive transformation that blends a Padé‐like function with local quadratic corrections for small values and steep penalties for negatives. A dynamic threshold (via a high‐order Padé approximant) and an extra modulation term (augmented by nested softplus or softsign chains and additional sine/cosine corrections) further refine the signal. The final transformed value, raised to an adaptive exponent that itself incorporates extra oscillatory terms, is linearly combined with parameters beta and gamma to yield latent utility, which is mapped through a logistic function to predict acceptance.

For run 50, please develop an innovative computational model for responder decision-making with the following instructions:

1. Compute the normalized offer:
  N_offer = split_self / combined_earning.

2. Compute the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).

3. Define the fairness gap:
  F = N_offer − N_share.

4. Scale the fairness gap by the learnable parameter phi (with bounds [0.5, 1.5]):
  x = F / phi.

5. For the absolute value |x|, compute the core nonlinear components:
  • |x|^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × |x|)
  • 0.2 × atan(1.1 × |x|)
  • 0.1 × (1 − exp(−|x|))
  • 0.05 × (1 − exp(−2 × |x|))
  • 0.03 × tanh(|x|)
  • 0.02 × sin(0.5 × |x|)
  • 0.012 × (1 − cos(0.3 × |x|))
  • 0.005 × exp(−|x|)
  Optionally include extra terms such as 0.005 × sin(2.2 × |x|) and 0.002 × cos(3.0 × |x|).

6. Sum all computed terms and add a constant delta = 0.01.

7. Modulate the sum with a factor [1 + 0.012 × sin(|x| + 0.04)] (with phase shifts adjusted).

8. Form an Intermediate_Signal by multiplying the power-law term with the logarithmic term and then adding the remaining nonlinear components (atan, exponential, tanh, and additional sinusoidal terms).

9. Multiply the Intermediate_Signal by a fixed constant C (choose a value in the range [1.05, 1.10]).

10. Apply sequential modulation stages with slight phase modifications:
  a. Multiply by [1 + 0.008 × cos(|x| + 0.06)].
  b. Multiply by [1 + 0.005 × sin(|x| + 0.11)].
  c. Multiply by [1 + 0.004 × cos(|x| + 0.08)].
  d. Multiply by [1 + 0.006 × (sin(|x| + 0.03) × cos(|x| + 0.05))].
  e. Optionally, multiply by [1 + 0.003 × (sin(|x| + 0.025) × cos(|x| + 0.045))].

11. Introduce an extra nonlinear blending layer by applying a ReLU-like transformation (e.g., f_relu(z) = max(0, z)) to the modulated signal, compressing extreme values in an alternative fashion to softplus.

12. Further blend the resulting signal with an extra multiplicative layer that combines:
  • An exponential decay factor, exp(−|x|/0.1), and
  • A softsign mapping of the intermediate modulated signal.
Multiply these factors together to form a combined modulation.

13. Add a small constant offset of 1e-6 for numerical stability.

14. Compress the final blended signal by raising it to a fixed exponent E (use E = 0.92).

15. Define the final nonlinear transformation as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (combined mandatory components from the power-log blend with delta) × (product of all modulation factors—including the ReLU-like blending and the exponential decay–softsign modulation) + 1e-6 ]^(E) }.

16. Compute the latent utility:
  U = beta + gamma × f(F/phi).

17. Convert U to an acceptance probability using the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(−U)).

Remember, exactly three learnable parameters are allowed:
  • beta (baseline bias) ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma (sensitivity) ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi (scaling factor) ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

For run 6, we want to push the modeling approach further by encouraging creative yet interpretable modifications. In addition to the standard power transformation (sgn(x) × |x|^0.5) on the normalized fairness gap, consider the possibility of including an offset in the fairness gap calculation to account for potential baseline discrepancies or numerical instabilities (for example, when values are close to zero). While the core structure remains similar, this run should encourage exploration of non‑obvious adjustments in the transformation stage to improve parameter recovery and overall accuracy. Emphasize that the normalized fairness gap is calculated as the difference between the offer percentage (split_self/combined_earning) and the expected fair share percentage (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)). Each learnable parameter must have explicit finite bounds (beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]). The utility is then derived as U = beta + gamma × f((normalized_fairness_gap)/phi), where f(·) is defined as sgn(x) × |x|^0.5 but can optionally include an offset term if justified. The final probability is computed by applying a logistic transform (with temperature 1), p_accept = 1/(1+exp(–U)).

For run 6 of 200, please develop a computational model for responder decision-making that:

1. Computes the normalized offer as split_self/combined_earning and the normalized fair share as token_self/(token_self+token_opp), both expressed as percentages.
2. Calculates the fairness gap as: normalized_fairness_gap = (split_self/combined_earning) - (token_self/(token_self+token_opp)).
3. Optionally allows for an additive offset in the fairness gap for numerical stability if needed.
4. Applies a power transformation to the (optionally offset) normalized fairness gap to capture diminishing sensitivity. Specifically, use f(x) = sgn(x) × |x|^0.5.
5. Introduces three learnable parameters with explicit finite bounds:
   • A baseline bias parameter (beta) bounded between -10 and 10.
   • A sensitivity parameter (gamma) bounded between 0 and 10.
   • A scaling parameter (phi) bounded between 0.5 and 1.5 that standardizes the fairness gap before transformation.
6. Defines the latent utility as:
   U = beta + gamma × f((normalized_fairness_gap)/phi)
   (You may incorporate an additive offset in the fairness gap if this aids in ensuring numerical stability or improved parameter recovery.)
7. Converts the latent utility to a probability using the logistic function:
   p_accept = 1/(1 + exp(–U)).
8. Provides the complete mathematical model between <MODEL> and </MODEL> tags and the detailed variable descriptions (in JSON format) between <VARIABLES> and </VARIABLES> tags. Every variable, trial input, and learnable parameter with its bounds must be clearly defined and connected to the observable trial data.
9. Ensure that the formulation is concise, clear, and encourages innovative adjustments to improve model accuracy, BIC, and parameter recovery.

<SUMMARY>
This model derives a core sum from 11 fixed features and applies sequential sinusoidal and cosine modulations to compute an intermediate signal. It then uses a piecewise adaptive transformation that blends a Padé‐like logarithmic function with a local quadratic correction for nonnegative values and smooth nested nonlinearities for negatives. A dynamic threshold via a finite summation and an extra modulation term (which may include nested softplus and a Gaussian RBF) further refine the signal. Finally, the transformed value is raised to an adaptive exponent—including additional oscillatory modulation—and linearly combined with beta and gamma to yield latent utility, which is mapped via a logistic function to predict acceptance.

For Run 169, I recommend that we push the boundaries further in local nonlinear approximation by replacing the existing f_adapt function with an even more flexible scheme. Instead of a fixed piecewise softplus/softsign blend, consider using a piecewise function that leverages a rational (Padé) approximant for z ≥ ε – this will capture the nearly linear region and then gracefully saturate into logarithmic behavior. For z < 0, using a hinge loss formulation may better penalize negative values instead of a high-degree exponent on a nested softsign. Moreover, redefine the dynamic threshold T by moving from a fixed summation over powers of a to a rational function approximation (e.g., [a + c1] / [a + c2]) with tunable constants; this can adapt better over a wide dynamic range. In the extra composite factor, include an additional multiplicative term such as [1 + 0.005×cos(0.9×a)] or even a smooth maximum between two oscillatory terms. Finally, consider replacing the nested softplus chain with a nested softsign chain (or even a nested arctan chain) to better tame extreme outputs—all aimed at reducing BIC, enhancing parameter recovery (especially for phi), and improving overall accuracy. Let’s encourage creative, out‐of‐the-box approximations that diverge from the standard “logistic plus nonlinear transformation” patterns.

2. Set a_mod = 1.08 × a × [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)] and compute z by sequentially multiplying by [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)], [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)], [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)], [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))], and [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))].
3. Define w = (phi − 0.5) / phi.
4. For the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z), replace the previous approach with a more flexible piecewise function:
  – For z ≥ 0, apply a piecewise approximation that uses a rational (Padé) approximant: for example, if z < ε, use a quadratic correction (z + k1×z²) to capture local curvature, and for z ≥ ε transition to a formulation that computes ln(1+z) but adjusted by a rational correction to ensure smoothness.
  – For z < 0, shift z by a small constant (Δₛ) and then use a hinge loss style penalty (e.g., set f_adapt(z) = – max(0, –z - threshold)^p) so that negative differences are penalized sharply without over‐amplifying noise.
5. Redefine the dynamic threshold T using a flexible rational function (such as a Padé approximant) that can adapt its curvature over a wide range of a values rather than a fixed summation.
6. In the extra composite factor, add an extra multiplicative modulation term such as [1 + 0.005 × cos(0.9 × a)] or a smooth maximum between that and the existing term to blend oscillatory effects more gently.
7. Replace the nested softplus chain with a nested softsign chain (or consider a nested arctan chain) to more effectively dampen extreme values.
8. Compute the final transformed signal as f(x) = sign(z) × { [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra ]^(Exponent) }, with Exponent defined similarly as before but optionally augmented by additional mild oscillatory terms.
9. Finally, set the latent utility U = beta + gamma × f(x) and convert U to an acceptance probability using the logistic function.
10. Use exactly three learnable parameters: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

These modifications should encourage exploring alternative local nonlinear approximations that capture fine local curvature, particularly near z = 0, and impose a sharper penalty on negative signals. By leveraging rational approximants for T and replacing the nested softplus chain with a nested softsign, we expect improvements in BIC, parameter recovery (especially for phi), and overall accuracy.

2. Scale a with a sinusoidal factor: a_mod = 1.08 · a · (1 + 0.012 · sin(a + 0.045)).

4. Define the weight: w = (φ – 0.5) / φ.
5. Define a piecewise adaptive transformation f_adapt(z):
  • For z ≥ ε (choose ε around 1e–3), use a softened rational transformation that blends the logarithm and a small quadratic term (e.g., f_adapt = ln(1+z) + k₁·z²/(1+z) + tanh(z)) with softsign smoothing.
  • For z < ε, use a smooth, nested softplus (or softsign) formulation with a moderate exponent (try an exponent between 2 and 4) to avoid over-penalizing small negative signals.
6. Compute a dynamic threshold T using a Padé approximant with k in the range 30–50.
7. In the extra composite term, incorporate a Gaussian radial basis component (e.g., exp(–((a – 1)²)/(2·(0.25)²))) and stack a few nested softplus (or softsign) functions (2–4 levels) so as to smooth localized nonlinearities.
8. For the exponent modulator, add additional oscillatory corrections (for example, include sin(2a), cos(2a), or even sin(3a)/cos(3a)) to gently compress extreme values.
9. Optionally add a small local correction term (for example, 0.001·z² for |z| below a small threshold) to improve sensitivity near zero.
10. Constrain the three learnable parameters with strict finite bounds:
  • beta ∈ [–10, 10],

  • φ ∈ [0.5, 1.5].
11. Encourage exploration in the negative branch by moderating the negative transformation (e.g., using a nested softplus with an exponent set between 2 and 4 instead of overly high values) to improve parameter recovery.
12. Feel free to consider alternative nonlinear functions (or combinations thereof) that can provide smoother behavior and reduce over‐penalization in extreme regions while still capturing diminishing sensitivity.

Remember, the goal is to improve overall accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery. Experiment with alternative formulations within these guidelines to achieve better performance.

1. Compute the core sum: a = Σ[i=1 to 11] Fᵢ + β, where the fixed features F₁…F₁₁ are normalized to avoid excessive scaling.

  • For z < ε, avoid overly extreme penalization by using a smooth saturating function like a two‐layer softplus or a logistic transformation with a moderate exponent (target an exponent between 2 and 4).

8. For the exponent modulation, add additional gentle oscillatory corrections (for example, include terms like sin(2a) and cos(2a) with small coefficients) so that extreme values are compressed but local variation is maintained.
9. Optionally include a small local correction term (for instance, 0.001·z² for |z| below a threshold such as 0.01) to finely adjust sensitivity near zero.
10. Set the strict finite bounds for the three learnable parameters:
  • β ∈ [–10, 10],
  • γ ∈ [0, 10],
  • φ ∈ [0.5, 1.5].
11. To improve parameter recovery in the negative regime, consider employing a smoother, less aggressive transformation (e.g., a two‐layer softplus with a modest effective exponent between 2 and 4) for negative z values.
12. Finally, explore out-of-the-box nonlinear functions or mixtures (such as combining logistic functions with power‐law damping) that provide smooth transitions across the entire domain while capturing diminishing sensitivity. Experiment with combining these functions so that the transformed utility remains smooth and well-behaved.

We can improve the model by recommending a softer adaptive transformation for negative outcomes (using a nested softplus chain with an exponent between 2 and 6 instead of using very high powers), and by suggesting a dynamic threshold using a Padé approximant with a moderated number of terms (say, k between 30 and 50). Also, let’s add additional oscillatory modulation (sin and cos terms) into the exponent modulator to smooth the compression. We should also include an optional local correction term near zero to enhance sensitivity. Finally, we explicitly specify that the three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi) are bounded: beta in [–10, 10], gamma in [0, 10], and phi in [0.5, 1.5]. This should encourage out-of‐the‐box exploration and help improve BIC and parameter recovery while increasing accuracy.

<SUMMARY>
The model computes a core sum from 11 fixed features and applies sequential sinusoidal and cosine modulations to yield an intermediate signal. A piecewise adaptive transformation then softly maps the signal using a rational (ln‐based) plus local quadratic correction for nonnegative values, while employing a nested softplus chain with a moderate exponent for negative values. The result is further stabilized by a dynamic threshold using a Padé approximant (with k between 30 and 50) and enhanced by an extra composite term featuring a Gaussian radial basis function and stacked softplus layers. The final transformed signal is raised to an adaptive exponent modulated by additional oscillatory terms and combined linearly with base (beta) and scaling (gamma) parameters. Three learnable parameters (beta ∈ [–10,10], gamma ∈ [0,10], and phi ∈ [0.5,1.5]) are used. This design is aimed at reducing BIC, improving parameter recovery, and increasing predictive accuracy.

Finally, adjust the final exponent modulation by multiplying by the extra factor [1 + 0.008×tanh(0.5×a) + 0.003×sin(3.2×a) + 0.002×cos(2.5×a)] (instead of its previous value) to capture even subtler interactions. Optionally, consider introducing a small Gaussian radial basis term (e.g. exp(–((a–1)²)/(2×0.25))) as an additional multiplicative factor in extra to capture localized effects. These modifications should lead to better accuracy, lower BIC, and improved parameter recovery.

In this new run, we want to further improve the model’s accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery. Continue using exactly three learnable parameters (beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]). Retain the core structure where the fairness gap is normalized and transformed through a series of fixed nonlinear components and sequential modulations. Now, add an additional modulation stage that includes a squared tanh damping function—such as [tanh(1/(1+a))]^2—in the product stage to further smooth extreme gap values. Also, integrate an extra learnable multiplicative offset term (within a very narrow fixed range, e.g. [0.999, 1.001]) into the extra blending stage to help stabilize negative signals and prevent overfitting. Encourage creativity beyond the obvious by suggesting that alternative nonlinear functions (for example, a logistic function or softplus variant applied to 1/(1+a)) could also be considered for controlling signal extremes. The goal is to ensure that the overall transformation is robust over the entire range of a, with smooth transitions even when a is very small or very large. Do not include details from previous interactions—simply state the new instructions clearly.

2. Calculate the normalized fair share:
  N_share = token_self / (token_self + token_opp).
3. Define the fairness gap:
  F = N_offer – N_share.
4. Scale the gap by phi (ϕ ∈ [0.5, 1.5]):
  x = F / phi.
5. Let a = |x|, and compute the following core nonlinear components:
  • a^(0.5)
  • ln(1 + 3.4 × a)
  • 0.2 × arctan(1.1 × a)
  • 0.1 × (1 − exp(−a))

6. Sum these components and add a constant delta = 0.01.
7. Modulate this sum by [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)] to produce an Intermediate_Signal.
8. Multiply Intermediate_Signal by the fixed constant C = 1.08.

  f_adapt(z) = { if z < 0 then 0.01×z, else min(z, 1+ln(1+z)) }.
  Apply f_adapt to the modulated Intermediate_Signal.
11. Further blend the signal by multiplying it by a composite factor that is the product of:
  • Exponential decay: exp(−a/0.1),
  • A softsign transformation: softsign(z) = z/(1+|z|),
  • An adaptive reciprocal sine modulation: [1+0.005×sin(1/(1+a))],
  • A nonlinear damping factor: tanh(1/(1+a)),
  • And an additional squared damping term: [tanh(1/(1+a))]^2.
12. Incorporate a tiny learnable multiplicative offset (with fixed bounds e.g. within [0.999, 1.001]) in this extra blending stage.
13. Add a constant offset of 1e-6 for numerical stability.
14. Compress the final blended signal by raising it to the exponent E = 0.92.
15. Define the nonlinear function f(x) as:
  f(x) = sign(x) × { [ C × (core nonlinear sum + delta) × (product of all sequential modulations, the adaptive ReLU-like output, the extra exponential–softsign blend with the squared damping and the extra learnable offset) + 1e-6 ]^(0.92) }.

  U = beta + gamma × f(x).
17. Convert U to an acceptance probability via the logistic function:
  p_accept = 1/(1+exp(−U)).

New Instructions for run 199 of 200:
1. Compute the core sum as a = Σ[i=1 to 11] F[i] + beta, where each fixed feature F[i] is first normalized to avoid excessive scaling.
2. Scale a using a sinusoidal modulation: set a_mod = 1.08 · a · (1 + 0.012 · sin(a + 0.045)).
3. Construct the composite signal z = a_mod multiplied by successive oscillatory factors: [1 + 0.008 · cos(a + 0.065)], [1 + 0.005 · sin(a + 0.115)], [1 + 0.004 · cos(a + 0.085)], [1 + 0.006 · (sin(a + 0.035) · cos(a + 0.055))], and [1 + 0.003 · (sin(a + 0.03) · cos(a + 0.05))].
4. Define the weight: w = (phi – 0.5) / phi.
5. For the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z), design a smooth function that:
  • For z ≥ ε (choose ε around 1e–3), blends a logarithmic transformation with a small quadratic correction and tanh damping (for instance: f_adapt(z) = ln(1+z) + k₁·(z²/(1+z)) + tanh(z)), where k₁ around 0.05.
  • For z < ε, instead of aggressive power‐law transformation, apply a two‐layer softplus or logistic function (e.g., f_adapt(z) = ln(1 + exp(λ·z))/λ, with λ chosen between 2 and 4) to smooth the transition in the negative regime.
6. Compute a dynamic threshold T using a finite polynomial series or Padé approximant with order in the range 30–50. Experiment with a Padé form of T = Σ[j=0]^(J) (a^j)/(j!) divided by a similar series with offset.
7. In the extra composite term, incorporate a Gaussian radial basis function (for example, exp(–((a – 1)²)/(2·(0.25)²))) and a short chain (2–3 layers) of nested softplus functions (or softsign) to stabilize near zero.
8. For the exponent modulation, add gentle oscillatory corrections (e.g., include small sin(2a) and cos(2a) terms) so that extreme values are compressed while maintaining local variation.
9. Optionally add a small local correction term (such as 0.001 · z² for |z| below a threshold like 0.01) to improve sensitivity near zero.
10. Set the finite learnable parameter bounds strictly as follows:
  • beta ∈ [–10, 10],
  • gamma ∈ [0, 10],
  • phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].
11. Encourage out-of-the-box nonlinear functions: experiment with blends of softplus, logistic, and power‐law damping functions to smoothly transition across the entire domain, especially improving negative regime parameter recovery.

I'll instruct the model to replace fixed series (like the infinite power series for T) with a simpler rational threshold approximation, and to modify the f_adapt component so that for nonnegative z it transitions smoothly from a quadratic correction into a logarithmic saturation term via a Padé approximant, and for negative z to use a hinge loss function with an exponent (p) that is lower (e.g., 2) to lessen extreme penalties, thus improving parameter recovery. Also, I will require the extra composite factor to include an additional oscillatory modulation component (for example, using a combination of sin and cos terms) and to replace any nested softplus chains with a nested arctan chain for more robust damping. Finally, the final exponent should be allowed an additional mild oscillatory modulation (for example, multiplied by [1 + 0.001*sin(a) + 0.0005*cos(2*a)]). The learnable parameters remain constrained to beta in [–10, 10], gamma in [0, 10], and phi in [0.5, 1.5]. This should encourage out-of-the-box design that posits a more interpretable and stable model.

<SUMMARY>
The model computes a core sum from 11 fixed features and scales it sinusoidally before applying sequential multiplicative modulations to form an intermediate signal. A piecewise adaptive function then softly transforms this signal—using a rational (ln‐based) plus quadratic correction for nonnegative values and a nested softplus chain for negative values. A dynamic threshold is computed via a Padé approximant (with 30–50 terms) and an extra composite term, enriched with a Gaussian radial basis and additional oscillatory modifiers, further refines the signal. Finally, the result is raised to an adaptive exponent modulated by sin and cos terms and linearly combined with three bounded learnable parameters (beta in [–10,10], gamma in [0,10], and phi in [0.5,1.5]). This design is intended to improve accuracy, reduce BIC, and enhance parameter recovery.

For this new run, please introduce additional nonlinear corrections and flexibility. In particular, keep the overall structure but update the adaptive transformation on the positive branch by applying an extra softsign multiplication and an explicit clipping mechanism to curb outlier influence. For the negative branch, further exponentiate by increasing the power (e.g. from 7 to 7 or 8) after applying a softsign correction. Also, extend the dynamic threshold T further, including extra polynomial terms up to a^12 as before. In the extra composite component, add an extra sigmoid factor and an additional tanh multiplier for dampening extreme values. Finally, update the final exponent to include an extra sine–cosine modulation term such as [1 + 0.003*sin(2.5*a) + 0.002*cos(3.5*a) + 0.001*sin(3*a)]. Maintain the three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, and phi) with bounds beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

For run 126, I will further encourage the model to incorporate robust nonlinear correction mechanisms in both the adaptive transformation and the extra composite parts. In particular, I want the model to include an additional softsign term on the positive branch, to clip extreme values explicitly, and to add extra high‐order polynomial terms (up to a^12) in the dynamic threshold T. In the extra composite, include an extra sigmoid factor (to dampen extreme high values) and an additional tanh multiplier. In addition, in the final exponent, add an extra sine–cosine modulation term (for instance, a term like [1 + 0.003*sin(2.5*a) + 0.002*cos(3.5*a) + 0.001*sin(3*a)]). This custom configuration should allow the model to flexibly adapt to extreme responses while further improving overall recovery metrics and accuracy.

<SUMMARY>
This model computes a core sum from 11 fixed features, then applies sequential sinusoidal and cosine modulations followed by a piecewise adaptive transformation that blends a Padé‐like function with local quadratic corrections for small values and steep penalties for negatives. A dynamic threshold (via a high‐order Padé approximant) and an extra modulation term (augmented by nested softplus or softsign chains and additional sine/cosine corrections) further refine the signal. The final transformed value, raised to an adaptive exponent that itself incorporates extra oscillatory terms, is linearly combined with parameters beta and gamma to yield latent utility, which is mapped through a logistic function to predict acceptance.

An adaptive transformation f_adapt, which behaves as a leaky linear response for negative z and a convex blend of linear and logarithmic responses for positive z (controlled by the learnable parameter φ), is applied. This signal is then amplified by a dynamic threshold T and an extra blending composite capturing further nonlinearities.

For run 99, we want to encourage even more creative adaptive activation functions while emphasizing improvements in accuracy, a lower BIC, and better parameter recovery. We will urge exploring alternatives to the standard piecewise logarithmic transform in f_adapt – for example, a leaky or parametric ReLU variant or even a convex combination between a linear and logarithmic response. Also, the dynamic threshold T should incorporate an additional cubic or quartic term to flexibly capture curvature. Moreover, the extra blending composite should be revisited: consider weighting the softplus term more heavily (or even combining it with a linear term using a learnable mixing coefficient, though that mixing coefficient is fixed in our learnable set) to better handle extreme values and avoid overcompression. Emphasize that the overall model structure must remain intact and that exactly three learnable parameters must be preserved (beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]). Encourage out‐of‐the‐box experimentation with these adaptive components, as creative modifications here can yield improved BIC, better parameter recovery, and higher predictive accuracy.

For run 27, we want to build on the established framework while encouraging creative adaptations.

We can encourage trying an additional modulation term (for example, sin(2.2×|x|)) and also allow slight adjustments to the overall multiplier (e.g. testing a multiplier around 1.05–1.10) and compression exponent (around 0.90–0.94). Stress that only three learnable parameters are allowed (beta, gamma, phi with the same bounds). We want to ensure improved BIC, parameter recovery, and prediction accuracy even if that means experimenting with additional subtle nonlinear contributions and adaptive weights.

For run 62 of 200, simplify the extra blending stage further. Remove any extra sine or cosine modulations that are not essential and replace the previously used squared tanh damping with a clean, single softplus transformation directly on 1/(1+a). Retain the sequential modulation steps (the five multiplicative modulations) unchanged, but instruct the model to be parsimonious in its computations to avoid overfitting. Emphasize that the composite blending factor must now simply combine:
• Exponential decay: exp(–a/0.1)
• A softsign transformation applied on the sequentially modulated signal (i.e. z/(1+|z|))
• An adaptive reciprocal sine modulation: [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1 + a))]
• And a softplus transformation on 1/(1+a), defined as ln(1 + exp(1/(1+a))).

The product of these elements (multiplied by the fixed extra offset factor of 1.0 [within 0.999–1.001] and with a small additive constant for numerical stability) should be raised to the fixed exponent 0.92. 

Retain exactly three learnable parameters—beta, gamma, and phi—with bounds beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Encourage creative, unconventional model design while staying within these constraints to improve prediction accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery. Leave ample room for out‐of‐the‐box approaches beyond the “obvious” transformations while ensuring that every computed component is used in the final utility U, which is then converted via the logistic function to yield the acceptance probability.

In your final instructions, clearly detail the following steps:
1. Compute the core nonlinear sum (using the 11 components plus a delta constant).
2. Modulate this sum by multiplying by [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)].
3. Multiply the modulated result by a fixed constant C = 1.08.
4. Sequentially modulate with the five factors:
  [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)],
  [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)],
  [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)],
  [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))],
  [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))].
5. Apply the hybrid adaptive ReLU-like function:
  f_adapt(z) = { if z < 0 then 0.01 × z, else min(z, 1 + ln(1 + z)) }.
6. Use as the extra blending stage the composite factor that now is defined as the product of:
  • exp(–a/0.1),
  • the softsign of the sequentially modulated signal,
  • [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1 + a))],
  • softplus(1/(1 + a)) = ln(1 + exp(1/(1 + a))).
Multiply this composite by the fixed offset factor (which is exactly 1.0, within bounds [0.999,1.001]), then add a small offset (1e–6), and raise the result to the fixed power 0.92.

Finally, define f(x) as the sign of x times the product (f_adapt multiplied by the extra blending outcome) raised to 0.92 and compute U = beta + gamma × f(x). Then map U to the acceptance probability via a logistic function.

The final utility is formed as U = beta + gamma × f, where f is the sign-adjusted, doubly transformed core sum. A logistic function maps U into an acceptance probability, facilitating parameter recovery and robust predictive performance.",v0,"<think>
For run 62 of 200, simplify the extra blending stage further. Remove any extra sine or cosine modulations that are not essential and replace the previously used squared tanh damping with a clean, single softplus transformation directly on 1/(1+a). Retain the sequential modulation steps (the five multiplicative modulations) unchanged, but instruct the model to be parsimonious in its computations to avoid overfitting. Emphasize that the composite blending factor must now simply combine:
• Exponential decay: exp(–a/0.1)
• A softsign transformation applied on the sequentially modulated signal (i.e. z/(1+|z|))
• An adaptive reciprocal sine modulation: [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1 + a))]
• And a softplus transformation on 1/(1+a), defined as ln(1 + exp(1/(1+a))).

The product of these elements (multiplied by the fixed extra offset factor of 1.0 [within 0.999–1.001] and with a small additive constant for numerical stability) should be raised to the fixed exponent 0.92. 

Retain exactly three learnable parameters—beta, gamma, and phi—with bounds beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

Encourage creative, unconventional model design while staying within these constraints to improve prediction accuracy, lower BIC, and enhance parameter recovery. Leave ample room for out‐of‐the‐box approaches beyond the “obvious” transformations while ensuring that every computed component is used in the final utility U, which is then converted via the logistic function to yield the acceptance probability.

In your final instructions, clearly detail the following steps:
1. Compute the core nonlinear sum (using the 11 components plus a delta constant).
2. Modulate this sum by multiplying by [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)].
3. Multiply the modulated result by a fixed constant C = 1.08.
4. Sequentially modulate with the five factors:
  [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)],
  [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)],
  [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)],
  [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))],
  [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))].
5. Apply the hybrid adaptive ReLU-like function:
  f_adapt(z) = { if z < 0 then 0.01 × z, else min(z, 1 + ln(1 + z)) }.
6. Use as the extra blending stage the composite factor that now is defined as the product of:
  • exp(–a/0.1),
  • the softsign of the sequentially modulated signal,
  • [1 + 0.005 × sin(1/(1 + a))],
  • softplus(1/(1 + a)) = ln(1 + exp(1/(1 + a))).
Multiply this composite by the fixed offset factor (which is exactly 1.0, within bounds [0.999,1.001]), then add a small offset (1e–6), and raise the result to the fixed power 0.92.

Finally, define f(x) as the sign of x times the product (f_adapt multiplied by the extra blending outcome) raised to 0.92 and compute U = beta + gamma × f(x). Then map U to the acceptance probability via a logistic function.

Encourage out-of-the-box exploration within these guidelines.

For run 106, tweak the blending and extra composite functions further. We will still compute the core sum “a” from the fixed components plus δ, modulate it sequentially, and then compute z. In f_adapt, we continue using a weighted power–log blend with weight defined as w = (phi – 0.5)/phi. However, now we encourage a slight alternative by keeping this same structure for z ≥ 0 and maintaining linear scaling for z < 0. In the extra blending composite, increase the linear term inside the bracket from 0.003×a to 0.004×a to give greater influence to low values of a. Also, adjust the overall exponent in the extra composite from 0.945 to 0.947 to allow additional curvature flexibility. Finally, retain the dynamic threshold T and logistic mapping as before, and enforce exactly three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi) with beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

• In the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z), for negative z values, consider applying a slight quadratic adjustment (i.e. use phi·z² instead of phi·z) to capture potential nonlinear scaling in rejection scenarios.
• In the extra blending composite, add an additional harmonic modulation factor [1 + 0.003×cos(0.3×a)] to further tune mid-range sensitivity.
• Modify the final exponent by including a secondary oscillatory factor, e.g., multiply the exponent by [1 + 0.001×sin(2×a)] (instead of [1+0.001×sin(a)]).

For run 160, update your instructions to further boost flexibility and capture fine‐grained nonlinearity. In particular, require that the original core sum “a” is modulated as before, but encourage adding two new multiplicative factors inside the extra composite term: one based on a sigmoid (e.g., [1 + sigmoid(0.14×a)]) and one based on tanh (e.g., [1 + tanh(0.35×a)]). Also, add an extra oscillatory term [1 + sin(4.2×a)] as a multiplier within extra. Increase the negative‐branch exponent in f_adapt from 46 to 48.

Extend the dynamic threshold T; you can, for instance, sum from k = 0 to 120 or propose a flexible rational function.

For Run 170, we want to push the model further by encouraging more creative nonlinear approximations. We will instruct the model to replace its current f_adapt block with one that, for z ≥ ε, uses a rational (Padé) approximant—this will capture the nearly linear region smoothly and then transition into logarithmic saturation—and for z < 0, to penalize negatives with a hinge-type loss that prevents over‐amplification. Moreover, we will redefine the dynamic threshold T by using a rational function (for example, [a + c1] / [a + c2]) instead of a fixed power series. In addition, in the extra composite factor we will include an additional multiplicative modulation term (e.g., [1 + 0.005×cos(0.9×a)] or a smooth “max” between two oscillatory functions) to help capture mid-range nuances. Finally, we recommend replacing the nested softplus chain with a nested softsign (or even nested arctan) chain to better dampen extreme outputs. These changes aim to improve BIC, enhance parameter recovery (especially for phi), and yield higher accuracy. Be creative and feel free to vary the coefficients and structure in a way that breaks out of the most obvious patterns.

New Instructions for Run 170:

1. Compute the core sum a as the sum of fixed components F₁ through F₁₁ plus a constant δ.
2. Set a_mod = 1.08 × a × [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)] and compute z by sequentially multiplying by [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)], [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)], [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)], [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))], and [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))].
3. Define w = (phi − 0.5) / phi.
4. For the adaptive function f_adapt(z), use a piecewise function:
  • For z ≥ ε (some small threshold), use a rational (Padé) approximant that “clips” by transitioning from a local quadratic correction (z + k₁×z²) when z is very small to an expression approximating ln(1+z) plus a rational correction when z is larger.
  • For z < 0, instead of a high-degree exponent on a nested softsign, use a hinge loss formulation such that f_adapt(z) = –max(0, –z − Δₛ)^p, where Δₛ is a small shift and p is chosen to sharply penalize negative deviations.
5. Redefine the dynamic threshold T not as an infinite power series but as a rational function such as T = (a + c1) / (a + c2) with tunable fixed constants c1 and c2.
6. In the extra composite factor, incorporate an additional multiplicative modulation term—e.g., multiply by [1 + 0.005 × cos(0.9 × a)] or use a smooth maximum of two oscillatory expressions—to gently blend and capture mid-range behavior.
7. Replace the current nested softplus chain with a nested softsign chain (or nested arctan chain) to dampen extreme outputs more effectively.
8. Compute the final transformed signal as f(x) = sign(z) × { [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra ]^(Exponent) }, where Exponent is defined analogously as before but may include additional mild oscillatory modulations.
9. Finally, set the latent utility U = beta + gamma × f(x) and convert U into an acceptance probability via the logistic function.
10. Use exactly three learnable parameters: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].

This transformed signal is further modulated by a rational dynamic threshold and an oscillatory extra factor, then exponentiated with a mild oscillatory exponent modulator. The latent utility is given by a linear combination of a base parameter beta and a sensitivity parameter gamma times the transformed signal.

Three learnable parameters (beta, gamma, phi) are used with strict bounds.",v0,"<think>
For run 174, we want to push for more creative and flexible nonlinear approximations. Instead of using a fixed power‐series for the dynamic threshold T, we will require a simpler rational (Padé) form (e.g., T = (a+c₁)/(a+c₂)) to help stabilize parameter estimates. For the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z), for nonnegative z (z ≥ 0.0001) require that the model smoothly transitions from a local quadratic correction into a saturated logarithmic term via a Padé approximant—for example, starting with a term like z + k₁·z² then switching to ln(1+z) modified by an extra rational adjustment (such as + k₂·z/(1+z)). For negative z, use a hinge-loss formulation defined as f_adapt(z) = –max(0, –z – Δₛ)ᵖ with a low exponent (such as p = 2) so that the penalty for negative deviations is moderate rather than extreme. To further improve parameter recovery, instruct the model to add an extra oscillatory modulation inside the extra composite factor (e.g., multiply by [1 + 0.005·cos(0.9·a) + 0.002·sin(2·a)]). Also, replace any nested softplus chains with a nested arctan or softsign chain for robust damping. Finally, let the final exponent multiplying the product be modulated by a mild oscillatory term (for instance, multiplied by [1 + 0.001·sin(a) + 0.0005·cos(2·a)]). The learnable parameters remain exactly three and must be strictly bounded: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. These modifications are designed to yield interpretable and stable nonlinear models, improving accuracy, reducing BIC, and enhancing parameter recovery.

7. Define an extra modulation term “extra” that adds gentle oscillatory corrections and further smooths extreme values. For example, extra = softplus(softplus(0.001×a + 0.002)) + 0.0005×sin(a + 0.04), where softplus(u)=ln(1+exp(u)). You are encouraged to stack extra softplus or softsign functions if needed.
8. Define the final exponent modulator as: Exponent = [0.9478 + 0.00018 × ln(1 + a)] × [1 + α₁ × sin(a) + α₂ × cos(2a) + α₃ × sin(3a)], where α₁, α₂, and α₃ are small constants (for example, 0.005, 0.001, 0.001).
9. Compute the overall transformed signal: f(x) = sign(z) × { [ f_adapt(z) × T × extra × w ]^(Exponent) }.
10. Compute latent utility: U = beta + gamma × f(x), and then predict acceptance probability as: P(accept) = 1 / [1 + exp(–U)].
11. Use exactly three learnable parameters with strict finite bounds: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].
12. Additionally, consider adding a mild additive correction (e.g. a term proportional to z²) when |z| is very small to improve local sensitivity.
13. Experiment with alternative penalty functions for the negative branch (for instance, using a higher-degree power or a nested softsign chain) to improve parameter recovery.
14. Feel free to incorporate additional nested nonlinearities (e.g., stacking extra softplus functions) in the extra term to smooth extreme values and reduce variability.

<SUMMARY>
This model computes a core sum from 11 fixed features, then applies sequential sinusoidal and cosine modulations followed by a piecewise adaptive transformation that blends a Padé‐like function with local quadratic corrections for small values and steep penalties for negatives. A dynamic threshold (via a high‐order Padé approximant) and an extra modulation term (augmented by nested softplus or softsign chains and additional sine/cosine corrections) further refine the signal. The final transformed value, raised to an adaptive exponent that itself incorporates extra oscillatory terms, is linearly combined with parameters beta and gamma to yield latent utility, which is mapped through a logistic function to predict acceptance.

1. Compute the core sum:               a = Σ[i=1 to 11] Fᵢ + δ.
2. Apply a sinusoidal scaling transformation:   a_mod = 1.08 × a × [1 + 0.012 × sin(a + 0.045)].
3. Form the composite signal by sequential multiplicative modulations:   z = a_mod × [1 + 0.008 × cos(a + 0.065)] × [1 + 0.005 × sin(a + 0.115)] × [1 + 0.004 × cos(a + 0.085)] × [1 + 0.006 × (sin(a + 0.035) × cos(a + 0.055))] × [1 + 0.003 × (sin(a + 0.03) × cos(a + 0.05))].
4. Define the weight:   w = (phi – 0.5) / phi.
5. For the adaptive transformation f_adapt(z), use a piecewise function that:
 • For z ≥ ε (set ε = 0.0001), instead of using a pure Padé‐like function, blend a rational (ln-based) function with a local quadratic correction; for example, use f_adapt(z) = z + k₁·z² + ln(1 + z) + k₂·[z/(1 + z)].
 • For z < ε, avoid overly steep penalties by experimenting with a nested softsign or softplus chain with a moderate exponent (try an exponent between 2 and 6) to avoid instability.
6. Define a dynamic threshold T using a Padé approximant sum: T = Σ[k=0 to K] aᵏ × (1/2)ᵏ with K chosen from 30 to 50.
7. Define an extra modulation term “extra” that incorporates additional nested nonlinearities. For example, try a design that stacks several softplus layers (and/or softsign functions) optionally multiplied by a gentle sinusoidal or Gaussian radial basis term. This term should be tunable and help smooth extreme values.
8. Define the final exponent modulator as: Exponent = [0.9478 + 0.00018 × ln(1 + a)] × [1 + α₁ × sin(a) + α₂ × cos(2a) + α₃ × sin(3a)]. Consider allowing slight alternatives here (e.g., by including cosine or tanh functions) to improve the sensitivity of the model.
9. Compute the final transformed signal: f(x) = sign(z) × { [f_adapt(z) × T × extra × w] + correction }^(Exponent), where “correction” is a mild additive term (e.g., proportional to z² when |z| is very small) to improve local sensitivity.
10. Compute latent utility as: U = beta + gamma × f(x) and predict acceptance probability via the logistic function: P_accept = 1 / [1 + exp(–U)].
11. Use exactly three learnable parameters with strict finite bounds: beta ∈ [–10, 10], gamma ∈ [0, 10], and phi ∈ [0.5, 1.5].
12. Experiment with alternative penalty or smoothing functions for the negative branch of f_adapt (for example, using a nested softplus chain with a moderate exponent rather than a very high power) to improve parameter recovery.
13. Encourage out-of-the-box modifications in the extra term; consider adding a Gaussian radial basis term (e.g., exp(–((a – μ)²)/(2σ²))) to capture nonlinearity near an important operating point (for instance, near a = 1).
14. Optionally, experiment with incorporating additional oscillatory modulation directly in the exponent modulator to further fine-tune the compression of extreme values.

<SUMMARY>
This model derives a core sum from 11 fixed features and applies sequential sinusoidal and cosine modulations to compute an intermediate signal. It then uses a piecewise adaptive transformation that blends a Padé‐like logarithmic function with a local quadratic correction for nonnegative values and smooth nested nonlinearities for negatives. A dynamic threshold via a finite summation and an extra modulation term (which may include nested softplus and a Gaussian RBF) further refine the signal. Finally, the transformed value is raised to an adaptive exponent—including additional oscillatory modulation—and linearly combined with beta and gamma to yield latent utility, which is mapped via a logistic function to predict acceptance.

Based on the previous run, we want to lower the BIC and increase accuracy and improve parameter recovery. We could advise trying smoother alternatives for the negative branch (for example, using a nested softplus chain with moderate exponent instead of huge exponents) and to experiment with updating the dynamic threshold T (e.g., using a Padé approximant with tighter bounds) and give flexibility in tuning the extra term (including a Gaussian radial basis term that can capture nonlinearity near a = 1). We could also encourage the addition of oscillatory modulation directly in the exponent modulator. We want to encourage innovation, so suggest exploring different functions for f_adapt for both branches. Emphasize the need to define finite parameter bounds for beta, gamma, and phi.

4. Define the weight: w = (phi – 0.5) / phi.
5. For f_adapt(z), use a piecewise function that for z ≥ ε (set ε = 0.0001) uses a softer rational transformation augmented by a small quadratic correction and softsign smoothing; for z < ε, use a nested softplus chain with a moderate exponent (target exponent between 2 and 6) instead of very high powers.
6. Revise the dynamic threshold T. Instead of a simple power series sum from k=0 to K, consider using an alternate Padé approximant or a rational function that is less sensitive to extreme values. Allow K to be adjustable in the range 30–50.
7. For the extra term, allow an additional Gaussian radial basis function, for instance, multiplying extra by exp(–((a – 1)²)/(2σ²)) with σ around 0.25, to better capture local nonlinearities near a = 1. Also encourage stacking a few (2-4) nested softplus (or softsign) layers.
8. In the exponent modulator, include additional oscillatory components (e.g., include a sin() or tanh() term) to compress extreme values more smoothly.
9. Add an optional mild local correction term (such as a small multiple of z² when |z| is very small) so that near zero, the model is sensitive.
10. Ensure exactly three learnable parameters with strict finite bounds: beta must lie in [–10, 10], gamma in [0, 10], and phi in [0.5, 1.5].
11. Encourage out-of-the-box experimentation for the negative branch of f_adapt—try using a nested softplus chain with an exponent in the range of 2–6 instead of a very high power function.
12. Consider experimenting with a slight increase in the flexibility of the exponent modulator by incorporating additional oscillatory terms (for example, including both sin(2a) and cos(2a)), to allow a more fine‐tuned compression of the transformed signal.

The resulting signal is raised to an adaptive exponent modulated by additional oscillatory components, then linearly combined with base (beta) and scaling (gamma) parameters to yield latent utility, which is mapped via a logistic function for acceptance probability prediction.
