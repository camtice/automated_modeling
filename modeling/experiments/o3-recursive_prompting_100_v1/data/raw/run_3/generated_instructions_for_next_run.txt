Okay, let's look at the previous run's results. The BIC was 31.04, which is pretty good, and accuracy was 81.6%. The parameter recovery for alpha was strong (r=0.821), but beta was lower (0.523). So the main area to improve is beta's recovery and possibly pushing BIC even lower.

The previous model used a dual-reference utility model with penalties for being below contribution-based fairness and opponent's share. The high alpha recovery suggests that the contribution-based term is well-defined, but beta's lower recovery might mean the inequity term isn't capturing the right dynamics. Maybe participants react differently based on trial context or there's an interaction with other variables.

The new instructions should encourage models that better isolate the beta parameter. Maybe splitting the inequity term into different components based on trial_type or using non-linear transformations. Also, considering how the total combined earning affects the perception of fairness could help. For example, a larger total might make absolute differences less impactful, so using relative measures.

Another angle is to incorporate trial_type into the model. For instance, in trials where the participant contributed more (trial_type=3), they might have higher expectations, so the sensitivity to inequity could be different. Adding a parameter that modulates beta based on trial_type could improve recovery.

The radical suggestion in the previous instructions mentioned prospect theory. Maybe framing the utility in terms of losses and gains relative to a reference point (like expected fair share) with different sensitivities for losses and gains. This could involve separate parameters for loss aversion and gain sensitivity, which might better capture decision-making.

Also, the previous model used max functions for penalties. Maybe introducing a non-linear scaling factor, like a power term, could allow the model to capture diminishing or increasing sensitivity to larger inequities. For example, raising the inequity term to a power determined by a parameter.

To improve identifiability, ensuring that each parameter's term is orthogonal. For example, scaling the contribution-based term by token_self and the inequity term by combined_earning might reduce covariance between alpha and beta.

The instructions should push for models that test these ideas: reference-dependent utility, trial_type interactions, non-linear scaling of terms, and separation of loss/gain sensitivities. Keeping the parameter count at 3 to balance complexity and identifiability.

**Instructions for Run 4/200:**  
Design a model implementing *neuroeconomic prospect theory principles* with these innovations:  
1. **Reference-Dependent Utility**  
   - Define utility relative to a dynamic reference point: `reference = γ*(3*token_self) + (1-γ)*(combined_earning/2)`  
   - Encode gains/losses asymmetrically: `Δ = split_self - reference`  
   - Apply separate parameters for loss aversion (λ) and gain sensitivity (κ):  
     `U = κ*max(0,Δ) - λ*max(0,-Δ) - β*max(0, split_opp - split_self)`  

2. **Contextual Parameter Scaling**  
   - Let trial_type multiplicatively scale loss aversion:  
     `λ_effective = λ * (1 + θ*(trial_type==3))`  
     (θ amplifies loss sensitivity when participant contributed more tokens)  

3. **Non-Linear Value Warping**  
   - Apply concave gain and convex loss transformations:  
     `U = κ*(max(0,Δ))^σ - λ*(max(0,-Δ))^ρ`  
     (σ <1 for diminishing gains, ρ >1 for increasing loss sensitivity)  

**Radical Constraint:**  
- Use exactly 3 parameters (λ, κ, β) with σ=0.88 and ρ=1.25 fixed (empirically derived constants)  
- Enforce orthogonality by:  
  a) Z-scoring Δ before exponentiation  
  b) Scaling β by combined_earning/10 to prevent magnitude coupling  

**Targets:**  
- BIC <28 through strategic non-linear compression  
- β recovery r >0.7 via trial_type-driven isolation  
- Maintain α-equivalent loss sensitivity (λ) recovery r >0.8
