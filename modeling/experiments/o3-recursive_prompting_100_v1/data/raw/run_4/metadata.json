      "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts whether a participant accepts or rejects a proposal in the responder role. The model needs to focus on responder behavior, use the given variables appropriately, and ensure parameter recovery is possible.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which variables are relevant. The target is \"accept\", so the model should predict the probability of accepting based on the proposal's fairness. The key variables here are token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, split_self, split_opp, and maybe trial_type. Since the task mentions that equal split percentages don't mean the same fairness due to varying combined earnings, the model should account for the actual contributions (tokens) and the proposed splits.\n\nThe model should calculate utility, which when negative makes acceptance less likely. A common approach is to use a utility function that compares the proposed split to some notion of fairness. One standard model is the Fehr-Schmidt inequality aversion model, but maybe we can enhance it by considering the participants' contributions.\n\nWait, the problem states that the combined earning varies, so fairness isn't just about equal splits but also about the contributions (tokens found). So the fair share might be based on the proportion of tokens each contributed. For example, if the participant contributed more tokens, they might expect a higher share.\n\nLet me think: The participant's contribution is token_self, each token is \u00a33, so their contribution is 3*token_self. Similarly, the opponent's contribution is 3*token_opp. The total combined earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). The fair split_self would be (3*token_self / combined_earning) * combined_earning, which is just 3*token_self. But the proposed split_self might differ from this.\n\nSo the utility could be the difference between the proposed split_self and their fair share (3*token_self), minus some term that penalizes if the opponent is getting more than them. Also, there might be a parameter for how sensitive they are to unfairness.\n\nAnother angle: The participant might compare their proposed share (split_self) to both their own contribution and the opponent's proposed share (split_opp). So the utility could have two components: one for how much they're getting relative to their contribution, and another for inequity aversion between their share and the opponent's.\n\nLet's formalize this. Let\u2019s define the utility as:\n\nUtility = (split_self - \u03b1 * 3*token_self) - \u03b2 * max(0, split_opp - split_self)\n\nHere, \u03b1 is a parameter that scales the importance of their own contribution. If \u03b1=1, they expect exactly their contribution back. If \u03b1>1, they want more than their contribution. \u03b2 is the inequity aversion parameter\u2014how much they dislike the opponent getting more than them.\n\nBut wait, the combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so maybe the fair share is (3*token_self) / combined_earning * combined_earning, which is just 3*token_self. So split_self should be compared to their contribution. However, the problem states that two equal split percentages aren't the same fairness if the combined earning differs. So maybe the model should normalize by the combined earning.\n\nAlternatively, the utility could be based on the difference between the proposed split and their fair share (proportional to their tokens). For example:\n\nfair_self = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nThen, the utility is split_self - fair_self. But participants might also care about the difference between their split and the opponent's. So combining both aspects:\n\nUtility = (split_self - fair_self) - \u03b2 * (split_opp - split_self)\n\nBut if split_opp is higher than split_self, that's unfavorable, so the participant might penalize that. So maybe:\n\nUtility = (split_self - fair_self) + \u03b2 * (split_self - split_opp)\n\nWait, but in the Fehr-Schmidt model, the utility includes aversion to disadvantageous inequality. So perhaps:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b1 * max(0, split_opp - split_self)\n\nBut here, \u03b1 is the aversion to being behind. However, in our case, we also have the contribution-based fairness. So maybe the utility should compare the proposed split to both the contribution-based fair share and the opponent's share.\n\nLet me try combining these ideas. The utility could be the difference between the proposed split and the fair share (based on tokens) minus a term that penalizes the participant if the opponent is getting more than them. So:\n\nUtility = (split_self - \u03b3 * fair_self) - \u03b2 * max(0, split_opp - split_self)\n\nHere, \u03b3 could be a parameter that scales how much they value their contribution-based fair share. If \u03b3=1, they expect exactly their contribution. \u03b2 is the inequity aversion. Alternatively, maybe \u03b3 is fixed as 1, and we have a parameter \u03b1 for the weight on the contribution term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fair_self is 3*token_self, and the utility is split_self - 3*token_self (their contribution) minus \u03b2 times the difference if the opponent gets more. But since combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), maybe the fair split is proportional. Let me recast:\n\nfair_self = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nSo split_self should be compared to this fair_self. The utility could then be:\n\nUtility = (split_self - fair_self) - \u03b2 * max(0, split_opp - split_self)\n\nBut maybe participants have different sensitivities to under-receiving compared to their fair share versus the inequity. So perhaps two parameters: \u03b1 for the weight on the fair share difference, and \u03b2 for the inequity.\n\nUtility = \u03b1*(split_self - fair_self) - \u03b2*max(0, split_opp - split_self)\n\nIf \u03b1 is positive, getting more than fair_self increases utility. The second term subtracts utility if the opponent gets more. Then, the probability of accepting is a logistic function of Utility.\n\nBut the problem states that the model should predict utility where less than 0 is less than 50% likely. So the acceptance probability would be 1 / (1 + exp(-Utility)). So if Utility is positive, more likely to accept.\n\nNow, parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 need to be learned. The variables in the dataset that are needed are split_self, split_opp, token_self, token_opp, combined_earning (to compute fair_self). The trial_role is 1 for responder, so we filter those trials.\n\nThe model needs to use variables available in the dataset. Let's check:\n\nfair_self can be calculated as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. But combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so actually, fair_self = 3*token_self. Wait, because combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning = 3*token_self. So fair_self is simply 3*token_self. That's interesting. So split_self is compared to 3*token_self. So the first term is split_self - 3*token_self. The second term is max(0, split_opp - split_self). So the utility is:\n\nUtility = \u03b1*(split_self - 3*token_self) - \u03b2*max(0, split_opp - split_self)\n\nBut wait, in the dataset, combined_earning is given, which is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So maybe the fair_self is 3*token_self, and the fair_opp is 3*token_opp. So the fair split would be split_self = 3*token_self and split_opp = 3*token_opp. But the actual split_self and split_opp may differ. So the utility is how much they get over their fair share, minus a penalty if the opponent gets more than them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the participant feels entitled to their own contribution (3*token_self), so any amount above that is a gain, below is a loss. Then, the utility could be modeled with loss aversion, where losses are weighted more than gains. But the problem says to predict utility where less than 0 leads to <50% acceptance. So perhaps:\n\nUtility = (split_self - reference_point) + other_terms\n\nThe reference point could be their own contribution (3*token_self). So if split_self is less than 3*token_self, that's a loss, which would decrease utility more than a gain of the same magnitude. But the model needs to have learnable parameters. Let's consider a prospect theory-inspired model.\n\nBut the instructions mention parameter recovery and using the variables appropriately. Let's stick to the initial idea with two parameters: \u03b1 (sensitivity to own fair share) and \u03b2 (inequity aversion). So:\n\nUtility = \u03b1*(split_self - 3*token_self) - \u03b2*(split_opp - split_self) if split_opp > split_self else 0\n\nWait, but the max(0, split_opp - split_self) would be the term. So:\n\nUtility = \u03b1*(split_self - 3*token_self) - \u03b2*max(0, split_opp - split_self)\n\nIf split_self is greater than 3*token_self, that's a gain. If it's less, a loss. The \u03b1 parameter scales how much they care about that difference. The \u03b2 parameter scales how much they dislike the opponent getting more.\n\nBut maybe the participant also cares about getting more than the opponent. So perhaps the inequity term should be max(0, split_opp - split_self) - max(0, split_self - split_opp), but that complicates things. However, the Fehr-Schmidt model includes both advantageous and disadvantageous inequality, but since we're predicting responder behavior (accept/reject), which is typically when the responder is receiving a proposal, perhaps the main factor is disadvantageous inequality (when the opponent gets more). So focusing on that.\n\nNow, the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 need to be bounded. The problem says to specify finite numerical bounds, generous but not infinite. For \u03b1, maybe between -10 and 10, but realistically, \u03b1 should be positive because getting more than your contribution is good. So perhaps \u03b1 is in [0, 5]. Similarly, \u03b2 should be positive as aversion to the opponent getting more, so [0, 5]. These are generous bounds.\n\nThe utility is then passed through a logistic function to get the probability of acceptance. The model's prediction for \"accept\" is a Bernoulli trial with probability 1/(1 + exp(-Utility)).\n\nNow, let's check if all variables used are in the dataset. split_self, split_opp, token_self, token_opp are all present. combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), but since combined_earning is a variable in the dataset, maybe we can use it directly. However, in the calculation of 3*token_self, we can compute that from token_self. So the model uses split_self, split_opp, token_self.\n\nWait, the model as defined uses split_self - 3*token_self. But 3*token_self is the participant's contribution. So the term (split_self - 3*token_self) represents how much they're getting over their contribution. If this is positive, it's a gain; negative, a loss. The \u03b1 parameter scales this difference. The \u03b2 parameter scales the disadvantageous inequality (split_opp > split_self).\n\nSo the final model equation would be:\n\nUtility = \u03b1*(split_self - 3*token_self) - \u03b2*max(0, split_opp - split_self)\n\nThen, the probability of accepting is logistic(Utility). If Utility > 0, probability > 0.5.\n\nThis model uses the variables split_self, split_opp, token_self. All of which are present in the dataset. The parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 are learnable with bounds [0, 5].\n\nNow, let's structure this into the required format.\n\nThe mathematical model between <MODEL> tags would be:\n\nUtility = alpha * (split_self - 3 * token_self) - beta * max(0, split_opp - split_self)\n\nVariables:\n\n- alpha: learnable parameter, scaling the importance of getting one's fair share (based on their tokens).\n- beta: learnable parameter, scaling the aversion to the opponent getting more.\n- split_self, split_opp, token_self: data variables.\n\nEach variable in the dataset is used appropriately.

  "full_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The goal is to design a computational model that predicts whether a participant accepts or rejects a proposal in the responder role. The model needs to focus on responder behavior, use the given variables appropriately, and ensure parameter recovery is possible.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which variables are relevant. The target is \"accept\", so the model should predict the probability of accepting based on the proposal's fairness. The key variables here are token_self, token_opp, combined_earning, split_self, split_opp, and maybe trial_type. Since the task mentions that equal split percentages don't mean the same fairness due to varying combined earnings, the model should account for the actual contributions (tokens) and the proposed splits.\n\nThe model should calculate utility, which when negative makes acceptance less likely. A common approach is to use a utility function that compares the proposed split to some notion of fairness. One standard model is the Fehr-Schmidt inequality aversion model, but maybe we can enhance it by considering the participants' contributions.\n\nWait, the problem states that the combined earning varies, so fairness isn't just about equal splits but also about the contributions (tokens found). So the fair share might be based on the proportion of tokens each contributed. For example, if the participant contributed more tokens, they might expect a higher share.\n\nLet me think: The participant's contribution is token_self, each token is \u00a33, so their contribution is 3*token_self. Similarly, the opponent's contribution is 3*token_opp. The total combined earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp). The fair split_self would be (3*token_self / combined_earning) * combined_earning, which is just 3*token_self. But the proposed split_self might differ from this.\n\nSo the utility could be the difference between the proposed split_self and their fair share (3*token_self), minus some term that penalizes if the opponent is getting more than them. Also, there might be a parameter for how sensitive they are to unfairness.\n\nAnother angle: The participant might compare their proposed share (split_self) to both their own contribution and the opponent's proposed share (split_opp). So the utility could have two components: one for how much they're getting relative to their contribution, and another for inequity aversion between their share and the opponent's.\n\nLet's formalize this. Let\u2019s define the utility as:\n\nUtility = (split_self - \u03b1 * 3*token_self) - \u03b2 * max(0, split_opp - split_self)\n\nHere, \u03b1 is a parameter that scales the importance of their own contribution. If \u03b1=1, they expect exactly their contribution back. If \u03b1>1, they want more than their contribution. \u03b2 is the inequity aversion parameter\u2014how much they dislike the opponent getting more than them.\n\nBut wait, the combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so maybe the fair share is (3*token_self) / combined_earning * combined_earning, which is just 3*token_self. So split_self should be compared to their contribution. However, the problem states that two equal split percentages aren't the same fairness if the combined earning differs. So maybe the model should normalize by the combined earning.\n\nAlternatively, the utility could be based on the difference between the proposed split and their fair share (proportional to their tokens). For example:\n\nfair_self = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nThen, the utility is split_self - fair_self. But participants might also care about the difference between their split and the opponent's. So combining both aspects:\n\nUtility = (split_self - fair_self) - \u03b2 * (split_opp - split_self)\n\nBut if split_opp is higher than split_self, that's unfavorable, so the participant might penalize that. So maybe:\n\nUtility = (split_self - fair_self) + \u03b2 * (split_self - split_opp)\n\nWait, but in the Fehr-Schmidt model, the utility includes aversion to disadvantageous inequality. So perhaps:\n\nUtility = split_self - \u03b1 * max(0, split_opp - split_self)\n\nBut here, \u03b1 is the aversion to being behind. However, in our case, we also have the contribution-based fairness. So maybe the utility should compare the proposed split to both the contribution-based fair share and the opponent's share.\n\nLet me try combining these ideas. The utility could be the difference between the proposed split and the fair share (based on tokens) minus a term that penalizes the participant if the opponent is getting more than them. So:\n\nUtility = (split_self - \u03b3 * fair_self) - \u03b2 * max(0, split_opp - split_self)\n\nHere, \u03b3 could be a parameter that scales how much they value their contribution-based fair share. If \u03b3=1, they expect exactly their contribution. \u03b2 is the inequity aversion. Alternatively, maybe \u03b3 is fixed as 1, and we have a parameter \u03b1 for the weight on the contribution term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fair_self is 3*token_self, and the utility is split_self - 3*token_self (their contribution) minus \u03b2 times the difference if the opponent gets more. But since combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), maybe the fair split is proportional. Let me recast:\n\nfair_self = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning\n\nSo split_self should be compared to this fair_self. The utility could then be:\n\nUtility = (split_self - fair_self) - \u03b2 * max(0, split_opp - split_self)\n\nBut maybe participants have different sensitivities to under-receiving compared to their fair share versus the inequity. So perhaps two parameters: \u03b1 for the weight on the fair share difference, and \u03b2 for the inequity.\n\nUtility = \u03b1*(split_self - fair_self) - \u03b2*max(0, split_opp - split_self)\n\nIf \u03b1 is positive, getting more than fair_self increases utility. The second term subtracts utility if the opponent gets more. Then, the probability of accepting is a logistic function of Utility.\n\nBut the problem states that the model should predict utility where less than 0 is less than 50% likely. So the acceptance probability would be 1 / (1 + exp(-Utility)). So if Utility is positive, more likely to accept.\n\nNow, parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 need to be learned. The variables in the dataset that are needed are split_self, split_opp, token_self, token_opp, combined_earning (to compute fair_self). The trial_role is 1 for responder, so we filter those trials.\n\nThe model needs to use variables available in the dataset. Let's check:\n\nfair_self can be calculated as (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning. But combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so actually, fair_self = 3*token_self. Wait, because combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), so (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) * combined_earning = 3*token_self. So fair_self is simply 3*token_self. That's interesting. So split_self is compared to 3*token_self. So the first term is split_self - 3*token_self. The second term is max(0, split_opp - split_self). So the utility is:\n\nUtility = \u03b1*(split_self - 3*token_self) - \u03b2*max(0, split_opp - split_self)\n\nBut wait, in the dataset, combined_earning is given, which is 3*(token_self + token_opp). So maybe the fair_self is 3*token_self, and the fair_opp is 3*token_opp. So the fair split would be split_self = 3*token_self and split_opp = 3*token_opp. But the actual split_self and split_opp may differ. So the utility is how much they get over their fair share, minus a penalty if the opponent gets more than them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the participant feels entitled to their own contribution (3*token_self), so any amount above that is a gain, below is a loss. Then, the utility could be modeled with loss aversion, where losses are weighted more than gains. But the problem says to predict utility where less than 0 leads to <50% acceptance. So perhaps:\n\nUtility = (split_self - reference_point) + other_terms\n\nThe reference point could be their own contribution (3*token_self). So if split_self is less than 3*token_self, that's a loss, which would decrease utility more than a gain of the same magnitude. But the model needs to have learnable parameters. Let's consider a prospect theory-inspired model.\n\nBut the instructions mention parameter recovery and using the variables appropriately. Let's stick to the initial idea with two parameters: \u03b1 (sensitivity to own fair share) and \u03b2 (inequity aversion). So:\n\nUtility = \u03b1*(split_self - 3*token_self) - \u03b2*(split_opp - split_self) if split_opp > split_self else 0\n\nWait, but the max(0, split_opp - split_self) would be the term. So:\n\nUtility = \u03b1*(split_self - 3*token_self) - \u03b2*max(0, split_opp - split_self)\n\nIf split_self is greater than 3*token_self, that's a gain. If it's less, a loss. The \u03b1 parameter scales how much they care about that difference. The \u03b2 parameter scales how much they dislike the opponent getting more.\n\nBut maybe the participant also cares about getting more than the opponent. So perhaps the inequity term should be max(0, split_opp - split_self) - max(0, split_self - split_opp), but that complicates things. However, the Fehr-Schmidt model includes both advantageous and disadvantageous inequality, but since we're predicting responder behavior (accept/reject), which is typically when the responder is receiving a proposal, perhaps the main factor is disadvantageous inequality (when the opponent gets more). So focusing on that.\n\nNow, the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 need to be bounded. The problem says to specify finite numerical bounds, generous but not infinite. For \u03b1, maybe between -10 and 10, but realistically, \u03b1 should be positive because getting more than your contribution is good. So perhaps \u03b1 is in [0, 5]. Similarly, \u03b2 should be positive as aversion to the opponent getting more, so [0, 5]. These are generous bounds.\n\nThe utility is then passed through a logistic function to get the probability of acceptance. The model's prediction for \"accept\" is a Bernoulli trial with probability 1/(1 + exp(-Utility)).\n\nNow, let's check if all variables used are in the dataset. split_self, split_opp, token_self, token_opp are all present. combined_earning is 3*(token_self + token_opp), but since combined_earning is a variable in the dataset, maybe we can use it directly. However, in the calculation of 3*token_self, we can compute that from token_self. So the model uses split_self, split_opp, token_self.\n\nWait, the model as defined uses split_self - 3*token_self. But 3*token_self is the participant's contribution. So the term (split_self - 3*token_self) represents how much they're getting over their contribution. If this is positive, it's a gain; negative, a loss. The \u03b1 parameter scales this difference. The \u03b2 parameter scales the disadvantageous inequality (split_opp > split_self).\n\nSo the final model equation would be:\n\nUtility = \u03b1*(split_self - 3*token_self) - \u03b2*max(0, split_opp - split_self)\n\nThen, the probability of accepting is logistic(Utility). If Utility > 0, probability > 0.5.\n\nThis model uses the variables split_self, split_opp, token_self. All of which are present in the dataset. The parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 are learnable with bounds [0, 5].\n\nNow, let's structure this into the required format.\n\nThe mathematical model between <MODEL> tags would be:\n\nUtility = alpha * (split_self - 3 * token_self) - beta * max(0, split_opp - split_self)\n\nVariables:\n\n- alpha: learnable parameter, scaling the importance of getting one's fair share (based on their tokens).\n- beta: learnable parameter, scaling the aversion to the opponent getting more.\n- split_self, split_opp, token_self: data variables.\n\nEach variable in the dataset is used appropriately.
