1,,"Let F = (token_self / (token_self + token_opp)) × combined_earning

Then, the utility for accepting an offer is defined as:

  U = delta + split_self – phi × max(F – split_self, 0)","A utility model for responders that combines the monetary value of an offer with a fairness-based penalty. The fair share is computed from the participant’s token count relative to the total tokens (token_self and token_opp) multiplied by the combined earning. Two learnable parameters—a baseline bias (delta) and a fairness sensitivity (phi)—adjust the utility: offers below the fair share incur a penalty scaled by phi, while offers at or above the fair share are unpenalized.",v9,0.9252978920269084,0.7034221470671219
